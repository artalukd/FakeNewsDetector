Owing to space constraints (maximum size of the zip file that could be uploaded was 10 MB), we have deleted all the data files, trained models, and pickled data structures. Only the code, script and result files are present in the zip file uploaded.

If you wish to view the working version of the code along with all the data files and trained model, the complete working version of the code (along with all data files, trained models, pickled data strcutres) can be found at the following Google
