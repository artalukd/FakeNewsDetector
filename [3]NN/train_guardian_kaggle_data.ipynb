       "'18 share the amish in america have committed their vote to donald trump guaranteeing him the presidency . ap photo dennis system columbus oh ap history was made today in columbus ohio when more than 3 million amish poured into the city to see the american amish brotherhood aab an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the amish community endorse donald trump for president . that number represents a significant portion of the total amish population which the united states census bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to trump for president . with the full force of the amish community behind him donald trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in november . the organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges such as urban sprawl that face the community . this year however the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant republican nominee . the amish who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the anabaptists have typically stayed out of politics in the past . as a general rule they dont vote serve in the military or engage in any other displays of patriotism . this year however the aab has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process . over the past eight years the democratic party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues said aab chairman menno simons . we have seen more and more christians being persecuted for their faith we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage . now they want to put a woman in the nations highest leadership role in direct violation of 1 timothy 212 . we need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles . donald trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the lords way . according to statistician nate silver of the website fivethirtyeight . com there are no possible scenarios in which hillary clinton can win with donald trump carrying the amish vote . the amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like pennsylvania virginia ohio indiana and iowa silver noted . they also have strong numbers in reliably democratic states like michigan illinois and new york meaning that hillary will lose those states as well . there is also a sizeable community in florida which while not as large as it is in the midwest is still large enough to turn florida for trump . over the next two weeks you can expect hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models . the clinton campaign issued a written statement to the aab asking them to reconsider their decision . i dont believe that donald trump is the person who best represents your interests clinton wrote to the aab . as a career real estate developer he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life . as former first lady of arkansas i understand the concerns of rural americans more than any candidate in this election . i implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent . most pundits believe that mrs . clintons plea is too little too late . during a press conference in manhattan trump thanked the aab for their support and promised to put the amish to work maintaining government buildings which he said would save taxpayers millions because the amish do great work for a very low price . though clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end many of her campaign workers have already resigned . according to the associated press it is expected that the clinton campaign will lose 50 of its staff over the next two weeks . there is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the clinton camp and many simply want to cut their losses . it looked like she was going to win this election easily said paul horner a campaign worker in ohio but this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant . cleary mrs . clinton took far too much for granted in this race and we are all now paying the price . its really sad to see the campaign end this way . if you are interested in learning more about the amish community and the aab you can contact the pennsylvania amish heritage museum at 785 2730325 . tags'"
