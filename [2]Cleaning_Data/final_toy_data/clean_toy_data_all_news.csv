English businesses 'should be forced to show hygiene scores',"All premises in England that sell food should be forced to display hygiene ratings to drive up standards and protect consumers from the risk of eating food prepared and cooked in unsanitary kitchens, local councils said on Monday. Council environmental health teams score outlets from zero to five based on factors such as kitchen cleanliness, cooking methods and food management, but businesses in England do not have to display the so-called “scores on the doors” ratings they have been given. Compulsory ratings already exist in Wales and will be introduced in Northern Ireland in October. The Local Government Association (LGA) is calling for mandatory display to be extended to England to help raise food hygiene standards at restaurants, pubs, cafes, takeaways, sandwich shops, supermarkets and delicatessens, and to reassure consumers. The hygiene scores for more than 412,000 English premises can currently be found on the Food Standards Agency’s website. Businesses across England should by law be forced have to display their stickers at their premises or face fines or prosecution if they fail to comply, according to the LGA, which represents more than 370 councils in England and Wales. “Anyone in England who sees a business without a hygiene rating sticker currently has to decide if they want to eat or buy food there without knowing what’s going on in the kitchen” said councillor Simon Blackburn, the chair of the LGA’s safer and stronger communities board. “It’s not always easy for people to judge hygiene standards simply by walking through the front door of a premise and know whether they are about to be served a ‘dodgy’ burger or kebab that could pose a serious risk to their health. “Councils always take action to tackle poor or dangerous hygiene and improve conditions and see first-hand what shockingly can go on behind closed doors at rogue food premises. “Businesses have recently been prosecuted for being riddled with mice or cockroach infestations, rodent droppings on food and caught with a chef smoking when preparing food.” Mandatory display of food hygiene ratings is supported by the consumer organisation Which?, the Chartered Institute for Environmental Health and many environmental health officers. Last year Gordon Ramsay’s Maze restaurant in Mayfair, London, scored just two out of five after inspectors found cockroaches on the premises. Immediate steps were taken and Maze now scores top marks. The LGA released details of recent food safety breaches, including in Croydon where more than 100 food outlets failed to meet expected hygiene standards last year, including 22 on a single street. One of the largest fines ever levied for food hygiene offences was imposed on a company operating two Croydon 99p stores. It was fined £154,000 in November 2015 after admitting seven breaches of food safety and hygiene laws. Both shops were found to have large mouse infestations when Croydon council food and safety officers visited. Liverpool city council health inspectors found a mice infestation at a city centre branch of Costa Coffee, which was fined £13,200 in court in March. The business agreed to a voluntary closure and admitted three charges of breaching food safety and hygiene laws. Liverpool council has since awarded it a five-star hygiene rating after successfully dealing with the problem.",REAL
"Tips should go to workers, not employers, says government report","Tips in restaurants, hotels and bars should go to workers and not their employers, the government said in a report published on Monday. After an eight-month review of tipping practices, the government said charges imposed on staff tips by employers should be scrapped or limited. Service charges on customers’ bills should also be clear and voluntary, the proposals said. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, launched the investigation last August after some of Britain’s best-known restaurant chains were exposed for withholding some or all of the service charges from staff – often without customers’ knowledge. Unions accused businesses such as Pizza Express and Giraffe of abusing the 2009 voluntary code set up to stop tips being used by employers to meet the minimum wage. Pizza Express, which took 8% of tips paid on a card, and Giraffe, which charged 10%, have since stopped doing so. Chains such as the Mexican street food outlet Wahaca and Jamie Oliver’s Jamie’s Italian have also deducted a percentage of waiters’ card sales to be shared with other workers, but other restaurants have used tips to pay for breakages, till shortfalls and customers failing to pay. The government is seeking views on options to ensure staff get more of their tips including: Banning employer deductions from discretionary service payments other than for tax. Limiting such deductions to the cost of processing credit card tips and dealing with the payment through payroll. Banning or restricting employers from charging waiting staff a percentage of their table sales during a shift. Encouraging properly managed “troncs” – arrangements for sharing tips administered by a staff member, not the employer. Publishing the report, Javid said: “We want workers who earn a tip to be able to keep it. That’s why I, like many others, was disappointed by the tipping practices of some of our well-known chains. This has to change.” Javid said the government would decide whether to make changes by revamping the 2009 code or, to give the rules more weight, enshrining them in legislation. The Unite union, whose campaign helped expose restaurant chains’ treatment of tips, said the report was a “massive, rightful victory” and called on Javid to change the law instead of relying on the voluntary code. Dave Turnbull, Unite’s officer for the hospitality industry, said: “The problem has always been that tips paid on a credit card and service charges are deemed the property of the employer. Until staff are recognised as the lawful owners of their hard-earned tips with complete control over how they are shared out, rogue employers will continue to cream off staff tips.” The proposals also attempt to clear up confusion and dubious practices around service charges added to bills that often go to the employer and not staff. There is no legal requirement for any part of these optional payments to be paid to employees. The government said customers often did not understand the charges were at their discretion and that they deterred diners from leaving a tip on top. Businesses could be banned from adding a service charge or forced to make it clearer that the charge is discretionary. Cover charges imposed by the restaurant also need to be made clearer so consumers know what they will pay, the government said. This article was amended on 3 May. Pizza Express and Giraffe have confirmed that they no longer take a percentage of tips paid on credit cards.",REAL
Sturgeon accused of breaking independence promise at Scottish leaders debate - Politics live,"Election debates are more common in Holyrood politics than in Westminster politics, as I said earlier, and one of the consequences of that is that they probably make less impact. Viewers get used to their leaders, and they know what to expect. This one did not feel as if was going to change many minds. Nicola Sturgeon is the dominant figure in Scottish politics, and she was tonight too. She was particularly strong on Govan and, even when coming under sustained attack from three of her opponents for her neverendum leanings (see below), she more than held her own. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, put up the strongest opposition. She was a bit too shouty, and relatively glib on the shipyard jobs, but she was forceful, giving credence to the claim she can make the Conservatives the principal opposition to the SNP. Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, seemed to find it harder to differentiate herself from Sturgeon and the SNP (not least because tax, where Labour has very distinct and progressive policy, did not come up). She was unpersuasive on the NHS and sometimes she sounded a bit centrist (see 8.37pm), but not in the way that being centrist worked successfully for Nick Clegg in that first debate in 2010. The Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie at least made a mark with a notable soundbite on independence (see below), and Patrick Harvie was probably best on PFI. One final point. Watching the debate from London, it was notable how little Westminster featured. There was a stage when devolved politics was to a large extent a competition as to who could complain most about the UK government. But that era now seems to have gone. And a good thing too. Here are the key points. Nicola Sturgeon was accused of breaking her promise to honour the result of the independence referendum and of being “anti-democratic”. The claim that she had broken a promise was made by Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader. She said Sturgeon should not keep open the “wound” caused by the independence referendum in 2014. Davidson went on: It’s not good for our country, it’s not good for economy, it’s not good for encouraging jobs and growth ... And [Sturgeon] made a promise. She signed a binding agreement that she would respect the result. And that is important. And before the referendum she went around every TV studio she could find and told every person in Scotland that it was once in a generation, once in a lifetime. She has gone back on both those promises. It is not good enough, and it is not up to her to see one opinion poll she likes and say we’re putting this country through it all once more. It’s not on. Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said Sturgeon’s refusal to rule out a second independence referendum was “anti-democratic”. He said: We had one of the biggest democratic experiences in our lifetime. [The SNP] celebrated it constantly. But now as soon as it’s over and they did not get the result they wanted, they want to do it all over again. Did they not get the message? We want to stay in the UK. Respect the result. I would even go so far as saying you’re anti-democratic. Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, also said Sturgeon should rule out a second referendum. She said: It’s not good enough. There is not a mandate for a referendum. Yet you [Sturgeon] are in two different papers today saying, ‘Yes we might have one’ and now saying ‘No we won’t’, trying to pull the wool over people’s eyes in Scotland, when so many people just want to move on from that referendum of the past. Mocking Sturgeon’s claim that she would only hold a second referendum if there was clear evidence of public support for one, Dugdale went on: She’s saying, ‘Let’s trust the pollsters’. If we trusted the pollsters, Ed Miliband would be prime minister. This is no way to govern the country. But Sturgeon said it would be wrong to rule out a second referendum. I think the question for other politicians on this platform is what is it they think gives them the right to stand in the way of a majority. Scotland will only become independent if a majority backs that. That is democracy. And none of us should fear the democratic wishes of the people of this country. Davidson was accused of lying about a government decision that could lead to job losses on the Clyde. Dugdale said that Davidson had “told a porkie’ when she said that the UK government was honouring a promise to build new type-26 frigates on the Clyde. She said: The first thing we can do is keep to the timescale that was made to the people who work on the Clyde. And Ruth has quite frankly told a porkie tonight. There’s an 18-month delay on work on the Clyde and it has to be reversed to honour the promise that was made to people during the referendum. Sturgeon said the Tories had “betrayed” the shipyard workers. Ruth is really misinformed because the frigate factory, the centre of excellence, that was proposed is one of the things that is not going ahead. I was in Govan shipyard on Monday talking to the unions. The reason why they are worried is because of the delay in the contract that was promised to the workers on the Clyde. Davidson said, if Scotland had voted for independence, there would not be any frigates being built on the Clyde. She also said it was “shameful” that Sturgeon was trying to scare workers about their jobs. That’s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. This is from the former Scottish Labour leader in Scotland Johann Lamont, referring to a question a member of the audience tried to raise. This is from the Times’s Kenny Farquharson on the debate. These are from the BBC’s Philip Sim. The SNP has now put out two news releases about tonight’s debate. In the first, Humza Yousaf, Europe minister in the Scottish government and the SNP candidate for Glasgow Pollok, criticised Ruth Davidson for defending Westminster over the frigates contract. He said: If the promises made to workers on the Clyde by the UK government before the referendum were to be broken, it would be an unforgivable betrayal – and people in Scotland would have been shocked to see Ruth Davidson try and defend the indefensible during the Leaders Debate tonight. It’s clear that Ruth Davidson will defend David Cameron at any cost, and if she has any respect for workers on the Clyde, she will immediately arrange a meeting with the trade unions – and apologise for the broken promises of this Tory government. And the second SNP press release claimed the debate showed that Sturgeon was the only credible candidate to be first minister because “Kezia Dugdale floundered over her plans to short-change Scotland’s health service and sought to mislead people on their NHS plans, and Ruth Davidson was put under pressure over the Tory government’s broken promises regarding shipbuilding jobs on the Clyde”. There seem to have been two main news lines in the debate. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, was accused of breaking her promise to honour the result of the independence referendum and of being “anti-democratic”. The claim that she had broken a promise was made by Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, and the claim that she was being anti-democratic was made by Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader. Sturgeon rejected these claims, saying that it would be undemocratic to ignore the will of the Scottish people if a majority wanted independence. Davidson was accused of lying about a government decision that could lead to job losses on the Clyde. Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, said that Davidson had “told a porkie’ when she said that the UK government was honouring a promise to build new type-26 frigates on the Clyde. Sturgeon said the Tories had “betrayed” the shipyard workers. Davidson said, if Scotland had voted for independence, there would not be any frigates being built on the Clyde. I’ll post a beefed-up version, with the quotes, soon. Dugdale says she would support the proposal by the EIS teachers union for industrial action over school qualifications. Sturgeon says the SNP government has a working group looking at the concerns raised by teachers. She hopes there will not be any industrial action. And that’s it. The debate is over. I will post a summary and some reaction and analysis shortly. John Swinney, the SNP’s Scottish finance minister, is endorsing the line used by Patrick Harvie. Q: Given the Edinburgh schools PFI fiasco, how would the panel ensure money goes to the right people? Rennie says at the time those PFI deal were justified. But he says there needs to be a proper inquiry into those deals, not least to ensure that private finance arrangements work properly in the futrue. Q: Were those deals a mistake? That’s a difficult question, says Dugdale. At the time those PFI deals were needed because the Tories had left schools in a state of wrack and ruin. There should be a review into what private finance methods work best. She points out that the SNP government is using its own version of PFI. Harvie says PFI was “the only game in town” because the Labour government in London insisted on it. But it was a mistake, because public borrowing is cheaper than private borrowing. She says public ownership of infrastructure is the best approach. Sturgeon says the SNP would increase health spending by £500m more than inflation. She says Labour is only proposing to increase health spending in line with inflation. That is shocking, she says. And that is less than the Barnett consequentials would imply. That is not true, says Dugdale. Q: So what does your manifesto say? Dugdale says it says Labour would increase NHS spending in line with inflation. But, using the revenue from tax increase, extra investment would go into public services. Sarah Smith says Dugdale is not putting a figure on how much would go into the NHS. Dugdale says Labour would keep prescription charges free. Sturgeon says the SNP are committed to investment and reform. They will increase the health budget by £500m, more than inflation, paid for by not passing on the tax cut for higher-rate tax payers proposed by George Osborne. She says Davidson suggests only rich people would pay prescription charges under her plans. But some people on as little as £16,000 would have to pay prescription charges, she says. And she says people with chronic conditions, like cancer and Parkinson’s, would have to pay. Rennie says mental health should be a priority. There are no mental health beds north of Dundee, he says. Harvie says the next Scottish government should introduce progressive taxation to pay for public services. Q: With an ageing population, and people more reliant on the NHS, how would you protect its funding? Davidson says the Tory manifesto contains plans for an NHS guarantee what would ensure its funding went up every year by 2%, or inflation, or the Barnett consequentials (ie, what England is getting), whichever was bigger. She also defends her plan to bring back prescription charges. The SNP have hit back on Twitter. Dugdale says the new powers coming to the parliament will allow the Scottish parliament to make different choices. Let’s use those powers, she says. She says she is appealing to those who voted yes and no to support this vision. Davidson says Sturgeon has the ability to bring the country back together. All she has to do is say that she will accept the result of the independence referendum, and take the referendum option off the table “at least for the next parliament”. Sturgeon says she is not proposing another referendum tomorrow. All she is saying is that, if a majority of Scots want one, she would give it to them. Sturgeon says she struggles with politicians standing in the way of the will of the public. The referendum that is causing trouble now is the one the Tories are holding on the EU, she says. Q: Should the prime minister prevent a second referendum if the Scots want one? Davidson says there is no mandate for a second referendum. She says Sturgeon has responsibility to the whole of the country, not just the SNP. She should not keep this wound open. She signed an agreement saying she would respect the result of the referendum. And she told people it was a once in a lifetime event. She says Sturgeon has gone back on both those promises. Sarah Smith takes a question from the audience. A woman says that 24 hours after the result the Tory government in London went back on what had been promised. Harvie says he backed independence. Respecting the result of the referendum does not mean those in favour of independence have to shut up about it, he says. Rennie says he does not want to spend the next five years arguing about independence. We had one of the biggest democratic experiences of our lifetime. Did they not get the message? ... I would even go so far as saying they’re anti-democratic. Sturgeon says she favours independence. The question was answered in 2014. But if the public change their mind, and there is clear evidence that people want a second referendum, they should have it. None of us should fear the democratic wishes of the people of this country, she says. She says she believes in something. She will not abandon her support for independence. What on earth is it about the democratic will that some people on this platform seem to find so frightening? Q: If in the future a majority of Scots want a second independence referendum, who are politicians to stop them? Dugdale says she believed Sturgeon when she said the referendum was a once in a lifetime opportunity. She says that in one paper today Sturgeon says she favours a second one. In another paper, she says she is opposed. Q: But what if the polls showed a clear majority of people said they wanted one? Dugdale says, if the polls were right, Ed Miliband would be prime minister. Labour is opposed to a second referendum, she says. Dugdale says Davidson has “told a porkie”. There is an 18-month delay on the contract for the Glasgow frigate. Sturgeon says she was on the Clyde recently. The workers there are worried by the delay. Davidson says Sturgeon has been “shameful” in what she has said about the Govan shipyard. She says that if the SNP had had its way in 2014, there would have been no orders for the yard. Davidson says the SNP would not be building any of these. Sturgeon says the Tory government Davidson supports has “betrayed” the shipyard workers. Here are some party tweets commenting on the debate so far. From the SNP From Scottish Labour From David Mundell, the Conservative Scottish secretary Willie Rennie says we need to invest in education. That is why we need “a modest penny” on income tax. He would invest in people’s skills and talents. This is from the BBC’s Philip Sim. Patrick Harvie says the Greens also believe in the need for investment in public services. And they want businesses to ensure they invest in the community. It is about changing the way the economy works, he says. And the Greens are the only party committed to moving away from a reliance on fossil fuels. Kezia Dugdale says we need to invest in people. She says Davidson’s arguments come out of the 1980s. If we continue to cut education budgets, Scotland would get left behind. Q: Labour would oppose the renewal of Trident. But you have not said how you would protect those jobs? Dugdale says Labour is committed to a defence diversification agency. It would find new jobs for those workers. She says the SNP have often said how they would spend the Trident money. But they have never said they would protect the shipyard jobs. Q: Your manifesto promise sounds hollow. It does not say how those jobs would be protected. Dugdale says Labour’s manifesto process is an honest one. It reflects the party’s views. Ruth Davidson says the increase for large businesses will affect one business in seven, and will make them uncompetitive compared to the rest of the UK. She says it is mistake to make Scotland the high tax part of the UK. She says the Tories want a business rates freeze. The SNP have been using business rates as a cash cow. And, going back to the jobs questions, she says the Tories want to improve skills and increase apprenticeships. Q: But we’ve had warnings that jobs could be lost on the Clyde if the Type 26 frigate contracts are delayed. Davidson says she spoke to the business secretary and was told there was no delay to the strategic defence review. Nicola Sturgeon says there has been a delay. It is an “absolute betrayal”, she says. Here’s the first question. Q: What specific plans do you have to create more jobs? Nicola Sturgeon says supporting small business is at the heart of the SNP’s manifesto. The party would continue the small business bonus. It will review business rates. It wants to help firms export, because the more firms export, the more innovative they are. And the SNP particularly wants to help the young find a job. It wants to use a youth jobs grant to help. Jobs figures have been “challenging” recently. Much done. But much more still to do. Q: But unemployment is higher in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. Business leaders say putting up business rates will cost jobs. Sturgeon says this will just affect big businesses. Ruth Davidson says the rate has been doubled. The BBC Scotland debate is starting. Sarah Smith is presenting. David Cockburn, Ukip’s sole Scottish MEP, took part in the first BBC Scottish leaders debate but has been excluded from this one. He plans to offer his comment on Periscope. He tried this during the STV debate but it was not a great success. Hopetoun House may look like, but the journalists aren’t impressed by the wifi. This is from BuzzFeed’s Jamie Ross. For anyone interested in a recap, here is a BBC live blog from the first debate. And here is a news story about what was said, focusing on Nicola Sturgeon saying she does eventually want to introduce a 50p top rate of tax, but explaining why she thought it would be “daft” to introduce it next year (because officials say it would lose money). And here is a news story about the STV debate, focusing on Ruth Davidson accusing Sturgeon of “keeping Scotland on a knife-edge” until the SNP leader believes she can win a second independence referendum. Here’s the set. Although the Hopetoun House debate venue is rather grand, efforts are being made to ensure that the journalists covering the event do not get ideas above their station. This is from the Scottish Daily Mail’s Alan Roden. And this is from my colleague Severin Carrell. One of the many things that makes Holyrood politics more modern and straightforward than Westminster politics is that election debates are the norm. There is never a problem with leaders refusing to take part because they are ahead in the polls, and none of this nonsense about how debating the issues at the heart of the election campaign could distract attention away from the election campaign. They are just an intrinsic part of the process. And tonight we are getting the final debate of the Scottish election campaign before voting takes place on Thursday. We’ve already had one debate hosted by BBC Scotland, and another hosted by STV. Tonight’s is the second BBC Scotland debate, and it features the five main party leaders. Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader and Scotland’s first minister Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader Patrick Harvie, co-convenor of the Scottish Green party It is taking place at Hopetoun House, on the outskirts of Edinburgh. As the BBC’s Philip Sim says, the location is rather grand. It starts at 8pm. In Scotland you can watch it on BBC One, and for those of you living outside Scotland, it is on BBC News. I will be covering it in full, and providing comment and reaction afterwards. If you want to follow me, or get in touch, on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow.",REAL
"Second Scottish independence vote not yet on table, says Nicola Sturgeon","Nicola Sturgeon has said a second independence referendum will be “off the table” until there is a clear majority in favour of a fresh vote, as she faced a barrage of attacks from her rivals. The Scottish National party leader was accused of misleading voters by breaking her pledges to respect the result of the 2014 vote, coming under sustained pressure from Labour, the Tories and Liberal Democrats over her planned drive this summer to build support for a new referendum. During a frequently ill-tempered debate televised by the BBC, the last before Thursday’s Holyrood election, the leaders clashed over the future of defence ship-building jobs on the Clyde, whose safety had been guaranteed during the referendum, and over health spending. But the clash over independence drew the loudest cheers from the audience. Sturgeon was accused by Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, of “trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the people of Scotland” by resurrecting the chances of a further referendum in the SNP’s manifesto for Thursday’s Scottish parliament election. With opinion polls showing that support for independence remains just under 50%, despite the surge in overall support for the SNP and the pro-independence Scottish Greens to a total of around 60%, the SNP’s manifesto takes a cautious stance on the prospects of a second vote. Unlike its clear pledge to stage one in the 2011 Holyrood manifesto, it does not commit the SNP to stage a referendum in this parliament: instead, it says one could be held if there is a material change in Scotland’s circumstances, such as vote to leave the EU against the wishes of Scottish voters, when or a clear popular demand for a further vote. Sturgeon insisted, however, that the SNP was respecting voters’ wishes. “If there’s no change in opinion, then it will be off the table,” the first minister said. But, she added, “if there’s clear and sustained evidence that the majority of people in Scotland do want a referendum, then no politician has the right to stand in the way of the way of the democratic wishes of the Scottish people”. Sturgeon had repeatedly told voters before the 2014 referendum it would be a once in a lifetime, once in a generation, event. But now, Dugdale said: “It’s mebbes if, mebbes aye and mebbes no; trust me and I will ask the pollsters.” Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, whose party are nearly neck and neck with Labour in election opinion polls, said Sturgeon had signed a pledge in the Edinburgh agreement in December 2012 to set up the referendum which said she would respect its result. “Her responsibilities are to the whole of the country, not just the SNP,” Davidson said. “Her responsibilities mean that she shouldn’t be keeping this wound open.” Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, said the priority of politicians now was to use the country’s new tax and welfare powers to focus solely on domestic policies. “We will not achieve that by having a groundhog day on independence if your disrespect the result [of the 2014 referendum],” he said. Clearly exasperated with being defended only by Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green party leader, Sturgeon told her opponents: “What I struggle with are politicians who clearly have a difficulty saying if a majority of people in Scotland want something, then they will stand in the way of that.” The debate at Hopetoun House, a stately home outside Edinburgh, came after the latest poll by Panelbase for the Sunday Times and Real Radio confirmed the SNP’s dominance with only five days to the election. It gave the SNP 49% of the constituency vote, 26 points ahead of Labour, and 44% on the regional list vote, 22 points ahead of Labour. Prof John Curtice, the elections expert at the University of Strathclyde, has said Labour has a marginal lead of only two points over the Scottish Conservatives on the regional list vote, in an average of six polls carried out during the main campaign before. While these polls show Labour is on average three points ahead at 20 to 17 in the first-past-the-post constituency vote, Labour is on course to lose all or the vast majority of its 15 constituency seats, leaving it heavily dependent on winning as many of Holyrood’s 53 list seats as possible. There were angry clashes over the fate of thousands of defence jobs at BAE’s shipyards on the Clyde, where eight Royal Navy frigates are due to be built, after Ruth Davidson insisted the Ministry of Defence had guaranteed the contracts would go ahead. To cheers from the audience, Sturgeon said that BAE wanted the construction timetable to slip, risking jobs. Dugdale accused Davidson of “telling porkies” because the destroyers were facing an 18-month delay. She said the Tories had to “make sure that [they] honour the promise that they made during the referendum”. Dugdale was later accused by Sturgeon of being “simply dishonest” about her party’s manifesto pledge on NHS spending, after the Labour leader claimed that her party’s spending promises were the same as the SNP’s pledge to increase health funding by £500m above inflation by 2021. Sturgeon insisted that Labour’s manifesto only increased NHS spending by at least inflation, a rate which would be lower than Scotland’s forecast share of UK health spending in future. “I think it’s shocking for a Labour party to say that when it’s not true,” she said. Dugdale said Sturgeon was ignoring the fact that the SNP’s taxation plans would see £3bn cut from public spending. That would not happen under Labour’s plans to increase income tax revenues by up by £1.2bn by 2021 – a figure four times greater than the SNP’s plans.",REAL
Bernie Sanders vows a contested convention despite 'tough road' ahead,"Bernie Sanders acknowledged “an uphill climb” ahead of him in the Democratic nomination race on Sunday, but vowed to continue battling against Hillary Clinton despite his diminishing chances of catching her. In a press conference to mark the one-year anniversary of an insurgent campaign that few ever imagined, he also revealed plans for a new series of mega-rallies in California and renewed calls on the party’s handpicked superdelegates to change their allegiances before this summer’s national convention. The Vermont senator conceded that in order for such appeals to make a difference, he would also have to win a majority of the remaining “pledged delegates”, whose votes are fixed according to election results. He would require him to win 65% of those 1,083 in remaining states to have a chance. “That is admittedly, and I do not deny it for a second, a tough road to climb, but it is not an impossible road to climb and we intend to fight for every vote in front of us and every delegate remaining,” Sanders told reporters. “It is virtually impossible for Hillary Clinton to reach a majority of convention delegates by June 14, which is the last day a primary will be held, with pledged delegates alone,” he added. “She will need superdelegates to take her over the top at the convention in Philadelphia. “In other words the convention will be a contested contest.” Superdelegates are party officials who are not bound to vote according to the results of their state or district. The defiant mood of the remarks at the National Press Club in Washington follow a strong weekend for Sanders. He received a series of backhanded compliments from Barack Obama at the White House Correspondents’ Association annual dinner on Saturday and is polling close to Clinton ahead of the Indiana primary on Tuesday. Clinton, in contrast, appears increasingly relaxed about her path to the nomination after a series of strong election wins in Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware on Tuesday, and a blowout win in New York, which all but guarantee she will go to Philadelphia with a majority of delegates. But she was on the receiving end of a number of surprisingly barbed jokes from Obama at Saturday’s dinner and some supporters may be dismayed to see that Sanders is not ready to rally around her yet either. Earlier Sunday, she told CNN: “I certainly look forward to working with Senator Sanders,” and promised “a progressive platform”. “I really welcome his ideas and his supporters’ passion and commitment, because the most important thing for us is for us to win in November,” she added. Sanders vowed to “vigorously compete” in the 10 states remaining before the convention. “We believe we are in a very strong position to win these remaining contests and we have an excellent chance to win in California, the state with far and away the most number of delegates,” he claimed. And the senator rejected the argument put forward by some in the Clinton campaign that his attacks have weakened her chances of defeating Donald Trump. He claimed instead that he remains the stronger candidate to defeat Republicans. Nonetheless, Sanders’ fundraising has dipped in recent weeks, and he may be counting on the tough talk to galvanize supporters through the campaign’s final few weeks. “The ideas we are fighting for are the future of the Democratic party and indeed the future of this country,” he said on Sunday, repeating his ambition to go to Philadelphia with a mandate that requires policy shifts from the party – and Clinton. “I would hope very much that the superdelegates from those states where we have won with big margins respect the wishes of the people of those states,” he urged. “Therefore, it is incumbent on every superdelegate to take a hard and objective look at which candidates stands the better chance of defeating Donald Trump and other Republicans.”",REAL
Ted Cruz rails against Trump-Clinton 'cartel' in final push ahead of Indiana,"Ted Cruz made a last-ditch series of attacks on Donald Trump on Sunday, going so far as to call him corrupt, dismiss fellow Republicans, and invoke Trump’s endorsement by “a convicted rapist” as he argued that his chances are not in fact dwindling in the Republican presidential primary. Cruz blitzed television airwaves on Sunday morning, making appearances on five talkshows and doing everything in his power to undermine Trump. He admitted Indiana was “important” to his campaign’s hopes, but doggedly refused to consider the possibility that Trump could secure the nomination. “No one is going to clinch it on the first ballot. I’m not and Donald Trump is not either,” he told the ABC show This Week. “It’s why Donald Trump is so desperate to say it’s over now,” he added. “It’s going to be a contested convention.” But a new opinion poll published on Sunday suggested Cruz is the candidate in dire need of a boost. The NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll showed him behind Trump in Indiana by 15 points, 49% to 34%, with 13% for Ohio governor John Kasich, the third candidate in the race. Poll averages show Trump ahead of Cruz by seven points in the state, which is one of the few yet to vote that could keep Trump from clinching the nomination. The stakes are high for Cruz. The senator is already mathematically unable to secure 1,237 delegates needed on the first ballot of the Republican convention, and all his hopes rest on preventing Trump from doing the same. Trump needs 282 pledged delegates, and Indiana and California are the two major states where Cruz has any hope of a major victory. The math did not deter Cruz from trying every rhetorical tool at hand to counter Trump. He insisted that the businessman is a liberal, and “flip-sides of the same coin” with the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton. Trump’s tariff proposals would “drive jobs overseas”, Cruz argued to NBC, adding that Trump’s foreign policy would leave the world without leadership. Not content to criticize the substance of Trump’s ideas, he accused Trump and Clinton of being agents of a corrupt system. “They’ve both gotten rich exploiting Washington, exploiting government power,” he said on NBC’s Meet the Press. On two other shows, he called the pair “enmeshed in corruption”, “ultimate Washington insiders” and members of a political “cartel”. He also abandoned the appeals to unity that he had tried to make in hopes of bringing moderate conservatives to his cause. He pointedly dismissed criticisms from other Republicans, namely from John Boehner, a longtime Republican leader and former speaker of the House, who earlier this week said Cruz was “Lucifer in the flesh”. “I kind of wondered if Boehner was auditioning to be Donald Trump’s vice-president,” Cruz told CBS. “You know, a Trump-Boehner ticket would really say the Washington cartel in all its force.” He was bolstered by at least one peer, however: South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who readily admitted that “civil war” had broken out in the Republican party. “Lucifer may be the only person Donald Trump could beat in a general election,” he joked to CBS. “But when it comes women and Hispanics, Trump polls like Lucifer.” But Graham grew serious when asked about Trump’s foreign policy, which he described as dangerous isolationism: “It will lead to another 9/11.” Finally, Cruz rebuked the businessman for the company he keeps. He noted that former boxer Mike Tyson had endorsed Trump this week, and alluded to Tyson’s 1992 rape conviction in Indiana. “You know, all the tough guys endorse me,” Trump said earlier this week. “I like that.” Cruz rejected the endorsement: “I don’t think rapists are tough guys. I think they are weak. They’re bullies and cowards. “We don’t need a bully,” he added. “We don’t need someone who yells and screams and insults.” Campaigning in Indiana, Trump waved off the criticisms as annoyances, and mocked the men and Kasich at length. “I refuse to call them the leftovers. It’s not respectful,” he said, before miming the look of a man clinging to the edge of a cliff. “The two guys that are hanging by their fingernails. ‘Don’t let me fall! Don’t let me fall!’” At a rally in Terre Haute, he said that he was already looking forward to the general election. “If we win in Indiana, it’s all over,” he promised. “And then we can focus on ‘Crooked Hillary’, please.” Earlier in the day, Trump did just that, telling Fox News Sunday that Clinton was playing “the woman card” and that “even women don’t like her”. He has for months accused Clinton of being a novelty candidate, although polling consistently shows that he is strongly disliked by most American women. And although Cruz recited a litany of attacks on Trump, he refused to say he would not support the businessman should Trump win the nomination. NBC host Chuck Todd asked Cruz nine times whether he could conceivably support Trump. The senator spoke at length in reply, but did not give a simple yes or no.",REAL
"Corporate wrongdoing now endemic in Australia, report shows","Corporate wrongdoing has become endemic in Australia, with hundreds of cases being pursued by the country’s regulators each year, and with few signs of their workloads lightening, a new report has found. But there are also fewer regulators “patrolling the corporate beat” in Australia than there were three years ago, with government agencies that monitor corporate malfeasance having their staffing cut by 3,926 people in total – or 14.9% – since the 2013-14 budget. The left-leaning think-tank the Australia Institute has released a new report, called Corporate Malfeasance in Australia, that shows the extent of wrongdoing in the country’s corporate sector. It calls on the Turnbull government to restore staffing budgets and resources for key agencies such as the Australian Tax Office (ATO) and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic), among others, to combat the problem. It comes two weeks after the government promised to restore funding to Asic by forcing Australia’s banks to pay for a multimillion-dollar upgrade to Asic’s surveillance systems – a move designed to help the regulator improve its ability to thwart corporate wrongdoing, much diminished by a $120m funding cut in the Abbott government’s 2014 budget. There is no database in Australia that gives a complete view of the corporate sector’s wrongdoing, and the AI report is an attempt to address that information gap, it says. The report surveys data published by Asic, the ATO, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), Fair Work Ombudsman, Fair Work Commission, and Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), in some cases stretching back a decade. “The extent of wrongdoing among Australian companies and businesses is surprisingly high,” the report says. “The publications of official agencies demonstrates that malfeasance by the private sector is widespread.” The report shows Asic has concluded 3,115 cases against corporations over the last four-and-a-half years, of which 2,095 were criminal matters. It took action against building and construction firms in 10,667 cases, over the last five years. The report says: “This is unlikely to represent the full extent of non-compliance by corporations with relevant legal requirements because Asic, like most regulators, has limited resources and a reluctance to take formal proceedings unless there is a very high prospect of success”. The report shows the ATO has been prosecuting an average of 450 companies a year since 2011-12, but that number fell to 300 in 2014-15, “possibly due to the staffing and other resource constraints.” It shows the ATO still recovered $3.5bn in tax in 2014-15 from companies attempting to hide their profits. “[But] companies also try to underpay the GST and other indirect taxes as well as PAYG on behalf of their employees; those amounted to $6.3bn in [2014-15],” it says. The report also shows the ACCC, over the past 10 years, has taken action against companies on 669 instances; the Fair Work Ombudsman, over the nine years for which we have data, recovered $250m for over 174,000 employees and finalised 217,000 separate complaints; in the six years to 2014-15 the Fair Work Commission saw a total of 71,106 claims lodged for unfair dismissal and roughly 80% of those were settled at conciliation. The report’s authors say staffing levels at Australia’s key regulatory agencies have been significantly hit in the past three years. It shows the government has cut Asic’s staff numbers by 14.4% since 2013-14 – from 1,834 to 1,569. The ATO has had staff numbers cut by 16.1% since 2013-14, from 22,022 to 18,482. The head of Asic, Greg Medcraft, has admitted budget cuts enacted by the Coalition have compromised the corporate watchdog’s ability to engage in proactive investigations. “It is difficult to understand the rationale for these cuts, given the official publications of the relevant agencies show that corporate wrongdoing is widespread in Australia,” the AI report says. “The publications of official agencies demonstrates that malfeasance by the private sector is widespread in Australia. The staff and resources needed to reduce this wrongdoing and to enforce corporate and workplace laws must be restored to the relevant regulators and government agencies.” Labor leader Bill Shorten has been calling for a royal commission into the banking and financial services industries to confront the amount of corporate malfeasance in Australia. Shorten says the sector had been rocked by a string of scandals that are “not isolated and one-off examples” but rather point to systemic problems in the industries.",REAL
Local elections 2016: how to judge what Labour's result will mean for the party,"Jeremy Corbyn will face his first nationwide electoral test this week since sweeping to the leadership of his party on a tide of anger at austerity and disillusionment with identikit politicians. Scotland will choose a new government, all seats in the Welsh assembly will be contested, cities including London and Bristol will elect mayors and 2,743 seats in 124 local councils are up for grabs. Even before the polling stations have opened, Corbyn’s allies are keen to play down the significance of the vote as a barometer of the party’s appeal, and the leader’s ability to project his message to different constituencies up and down the country. Corbyn himself told the Guardian last week: “We are placing no arbitrary figures on anything and I don’t think anyone else should. They are local elections, there are inevitably local factors, let’s see what happens.” But once the votes are counted, every Labour supporter will have to consider what would constitute success. Steve Fisher, of Oxford University, one of Britain’s foremost election experts, has looked at the claims and counter-claims for the Guardian – focusing on the local elections – and says there are three ways of asking that question: 1. What does Labour’s past performance suggest? Opposition parties almost always make gains in local government elections. And 2012, when these seats were last contested, under Ed Miliband, was a good year, when Labour did better than its poll rating at the time would have predicted, gaining seats. Corbyn’s allies are keen to make this point, talking about the “high-water mark” of 2012. Jon Trickett, Labour’s election co-ordinator, wrote recently: “The English council seats we are contesting this year were last fought in 2012. The results then were Labour’s best in the local elections since those that took place in 2001 on the same day as Blair’s second landslide election.” Fisher says: “There’s not much evidence from previous local elections that they should make big gains.” Based on their past performance in opposition, he suggests Labour could end up with roughly the same number of seats as before the poll. Ask the question in this way, and a handful of gains would be an improvement on the average – but on average, Labour didn’t go on to win the next general election. “Small losses would not, in the context of 2012, constitute a particularly poor performance, but it certainly wouldn’t be a sign of future general election success.” 2. Is Labour on course to win the next general election? Looking at the number of council seats won or lost alone it will be impossible to say. Having analysed the data on seats won or lost at local elections, and general election performance since the 1970s, Fisher said: “There is absolutely no discernible, sensible correlation there.” Tony Blair scored the record number of Labour gains, with 1,807 in 1995, but his 1996 tally of 468 gains – just a year before he stormed into Downing Street – was easily eclipsed by Michael Foot’s 988 gains in 1981, Neil Kinnock’s 584 in 1991 and the 800-plus gains for Miliband in both 2011 and 2012. “Big gains in local elections are no guarantee of future success,” says Fisher. However, there is a much stronger link between the national equivalent vote (NEV), calculated by the academics Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, and future general election performance. The NEV is an estimate of what percentage of the vote each party would be likely to have won across Britain, had all the seats nationally been up for grabs. Another elections expert, Chris Prosser, of the University of Manchester, has tracked the NEV for local elections against subsequent general election results. He finds that on average, Labour needs something like an 11 percentage point lead on this measure to deliver a poll lead and at least 15 points for a majority. Fisher reckons the current opinion polls – which are the worst for a Labour opposition going into local elections since 1982 – suggest this time we may end up with something like a one point lead for the Conservatives. That would put Labour well behind what would be necessary to point the way back to power. It had a six-point lead in 2012. Corbyn’s election strategists argue that the muddying of the two-party system in recent years, with Ukip picking up 4m votes at the last general election, makes speculation along these lines difficult, but after the collapse of the Lib Dem vote Rallings and Thrasher say there are actually more two-way, Labour-Conservative competitions than for most of the past two decades – and Fisher points out that it is Labour’s lead over the Conservatives, rather than either’s absolute share of the vote, that is the best predictor of which party is most likely to form the next government. 3. Is Labour making progress? Here, the answer is more straightforward. Although Corbyn’s lieutenants stress that 2012 was a vintage year, Fisher says: “It’s hard to say that they’re making progress over the Miliband years if you’re losing seats that he won. It’s easier to agree that if you’re making gains on 2012, then you’re doing pretty well.” Similarly, if Labour makes significant losses in Wales, or slips into third place behind the Tories in Scotland – where the elections are fought on different voting systems – it might not tell us much about the road to 2020, but it would be difficult to read as evidence that Corbyn is taking his party in the right direction. That’s where sceptics of the leadership, such as backbench MP Alison McGovern, who said recently that a loss of even a single council would be a “betrayal”, may feel they have a point.",REAL
"Inflation is scarily low – but it's Morrison who needs to act, not the RBA","Last week’s inflation figures showed that prices actually fell on average in the first three months of this year. The figures set off strong speculation that Tuesday will see an interest rate cut from the Reserve Bank. But while low inflation is a sign of a lack of demand in the economy, the latest figures suggest that the treasurer, Scott Morrison, is the one who needs to act, rather than the RBA governor, Glenn Stevens. We currently live in a world of very low inflation – historically so. We have become so used to low inflation that three months ago annual inflation growth of 1.7% was seen as too high to allow an interest rate cut. In previous years such a level would have been seen as scarily low. Prepare to get scared. The Australian Bureau of Statistics found that in the first three months of this year prices fell by 0.2% (the first such fall since December 2008) and annual inflation came in at a carpet-burning low of 1.3%: Underlying inflation, which is generally seen as the guide for interest rate decisions, also recorded very weak results. In the March quarter the two measures of underlying inflation – the trimmed mean and the weighted median rose – by just 0.2% and 0.1% respectively: This saw the weighted median recording a record low annual growth of 1.4% and the trimmed mean tying its record low of 1.7%: However you want to cut it, inflation growth is near enough to “bugger all” to call it thus without risking serious error. The market reacted swiftly. On Monday the futures market was pricing in a 16% chance of a rate cut tomorrow; by the end of trading on Tuesday it was rated a 53% chance, by Friday it was 58%: The market now fully expects a rate cut by August and a 50% chance of another cut to 1.5% by February next year. A big reason for the deflation in the March quarter was petrol. Falling oil prices in January and February saw automotive fuel prices drop 10% in the March quarter – the sixth-largest fall in a quarter since the ABS started recording fuel prices in 1972: Since February, however, oil prices have been rising slowly, so it is likely that the June quarter will see fuel prices rising on average. But fuel wasn’t the biggest fall in the quarter – that title went to fruit, which fell 11.1%. Although the fall was less when seasonally adjusted, even on that measure it was the second biggest fall. Fruit, like automotive fuel, is classed as a “tradeable” item – one that has its price determined significantly outside our borders – and it was such items that really drove the fall in inflation. Tradable items fell 1.4% in the March quarter – the biggest fall since December 2008: But over the past year it is non-tradable items that are showing record weak growth. In the past 12 months the price of non-tradables items (such as takeway food, rents, utilities charges, house prices, health and education expenses) increased by just 1.7% - the lowest this century: This low price growth of such goods and services really reflects the lack of demand in the economy and why many expect the RBA to cut rates. But should the RBA do it? Over the past few years one key aspect of the government’s budget strategy is the decided lack of interest in stimulating demand in the economy. Essentially Joe Hockey hoped the private sector with the assistance of low interest rates would do the job. But thus far there is little sign of that strategy working. The latest producer price figures released on Friday showed domestic final demand (excluding exports) fell by 0.2% in the March quarter and the annual growth of just 0.8% is a level usually associated with recessions. The December mid-year fiscal and economic outlook revised up the level of growth of public demand for this year to 2.0% from the 1.5% expected in last year’s budget. But it made no change for 2016-17: A key measure to look for in Tuesday’s budget is whether or not the government is to increase public demand – in effect trying to stimulate the economy through fiscal spending. Clearly the signs are there won’t be any major spending of a traditional sort but there is strong talk that the government will use “off-budget” measures to pay for infrastructure. Such spending may not increase the deficit but it should increase public demand growth. The RBA would be glad to see it. Stevens has for a long time been warning that lowering rates doesn’t have the power to boost the economy that it once did. Just two weeks ago he told an audience in New York that “while people find global growth outcomes still a bit disappointing, we are reaching the limits of monetary policy in boosting it”. He argued that “central banks must of course do what they can” but “surely diminishing returns are setting in” and he suspected “that more and more people realise this”. But the question is whether or not the treasury realises this or whether he still wants to leave it up to lower interest rates to do the heavy lifting.",REAL
Lib Dem and lawyers back Sadiq Khan,"I have been disappointed by the Green party refusing to be drawn on the use of the second-preference vote in the London mayoral election and by its recent election broadcast suggesting that there is little distinction between the Tories and Labour. I was even more disappointed this weekend to receive in my inbox an email from Lib Dem HQ telling activists to spend the last few days of the campaign “capitalising” on Labour party “troubles”. Let’s be clear: Caroline Pidgeon and I have spent the last four years on the London assembly working closely with both Labour and Green colleagues. Together we have mounted robust opposition to Boris’s abysmal record of inaction on housing, the environment and transport. We have worked together because we have found there to be a great deal more that unites us than divides us. To suggest otherwise is ridiculous and unhelpful. The Tory party is divided and isolated – out of touch and with luck soon to be out of office. Its campaign has been a disgrace. Its only remaining hope is that Zac Goldsmith will be able to spread the delusion that he is somehow an environmentalist. In fact his Tory colleagues on the assembly have spent the last four years arguing that London should become the UK centre for fracking; and he is advocating that Britain leave the EU, whose laws have driven all the major improvements we have seen in recent decades on air pollution, waste management, and carbon emissions. My friend and colleague Caroline Pidgeon will get my first-preference vote for mayor on Thursday. She has a well-thought-out set of policies for London and her eight years of experience at City Hall has shone through during her confident hustings performances. But of course my second-preference vote will go to Sadiq Khan. It’s a no-brainer. Stephen Knight AM Liberal Democrat London assembly member • We are all current or former legal practitioners. Sadiq Khan has, for over two decades, been a champion of civil liberties. As a human rights lawyer, Sadiq took on cases that tackled injustice and discrimination. Doing that type of legal work means sometimes acting for clients who sometimes had unsavoury and unpopular views. Sadiq has never chosen to hide this fact. He is standing to be mayor of London and we recognise that with that comes greater public scrutiny. But we are disappointed at attacks levelled against him simply because of his legal career and championing human rights before becoming a politician. Those suggesting that Sadiq somehow shares the views of such clients are simply misguided and demonstrate an ignorance of the way our legal system works. Lawyers act on instruction by their clients, not by adopting their views. Those making the claims against Sadiq either don’t understand the rule of law, or are choosing to ignore it for partisan gain. Neither of these are characteristics we need in a mayor. Second, by attacking Sadiq in this way, a climate is being created that risks discouraging the championing human rights – by those in law and in other professions – from standing for election. We have seen Sadiq in action either as a lawyer or MP. He is a tireless campaigner against injustice and inequality. That is why we are backing Sadiq to be the next mayor of London.

The Guardian view on the state and the market: the end of ‘hands-off’ economics,"The penalty for running a bad business is supposed to be failure. A free market system relies on the incentive of reward earned through enterprise, but it must also contain risk. The theory holds that evolution is at work, as good business thrives by innovation and competition, while the weak fall away. Meanwhile, democratic governments provide social guarantees so that this natural selection does not inflict cruelty on the citizens who depend on the economy for their livelihoods. That is why the ruin of BHS is a story of political failure as well as a product of commercial mismanagement. The collapse of the famous high street chain, leaving 11,000 jobs in jeopardy and a staff pension fund with a £571m deficit, has been widely reported as a case study of corporate greed. There have been calls for Sir Philip Green, who owned the company for 15 years, to be stripped of his knighthood. Sir Philip, his wife and Dominic Chappell, who heads Retail Acquisitions – the consortium that later bought BHS – look set to be summoned by parliament’s business and work and pensions committees, as part of twin inquiries into the affairs of what is now a hollowed-out shell of a company in administrators’ hands. If these probes go ahead, they might shed some light on the mechanisms by which the value that there once was in BHS was apparently turned to cash and siphoned off. That is if Sir Philip and others deign to attend the committees. They might, like Mike Ashley – the founder of Sports Direct, who now offers himself as an unlikely saviour of the BHS workforce – defy a summons to appear. MPs want to speak to Mr Ashley about low pay and alleged worker exploitation. He dismisses them as “a joke”. That episode testifies to the weakness of political institutions as a check on business. Market fundamentalists used to argue that this is as it ought to be, that politicians should not be allowed to meddle in commerce other than to uphold the law – and that there should be as few laws as possible. “Not just a light touch but a limited touch” was the mantra at one time. But that doctrine’s decline really began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and all the bailouts, government guarantees and taxpayer buy-ups which became necessary in its wake. It was clear then, when the protagonists were bankers not retailers, that the role of the state in the private sector goes well beyond deciding how much or little to regulate. A systemic, perhaps inescapable, transfer of risk to the public realm was laid bare, and the Pension Protection Fund’s prospective rescue&nbsp;of the BHS fund illustrates this once again. Meanwhile, the rewards for failure head offshore. What is acceptable and what is within the letter of the law are not the same thing. That is not to say that the capitalist ethos is inherently corrupt. There will always be a section of the revolutionary left that sees private enterprise as a quasi-criminal requisitioning of public goods. Most moderate left opinion just wants business to be run with more than a patina of social conscience. Ed Miliband made “responsible capitalism” the theme for his leadership of the Labour party. It didn’t translate into an election-winning slogan, and maybe it was never going to. Yet his agenda has been vindicated. It is no longer radical to observe that the short-term sweating of assets for quick profits, over-gearing and underinvestment, avoidance of taxes, poverty wages and job insecurity are symptoms of a disease that limits the shrinks the nation’s economic potential. It is, for example, increasingly common for shareholders to complain, as happened recently at BP, about remuneration packages for senior executives unconnected to commercial reason – or reality. Pay is just one example of a market that is not working as the theory says it should, neither maximising efficiency nor promoting best practice. British capitalism is riddled with failures of that kind. The social consequences, public anger among them, are impossible to ignore. That is not a reason to hate business. Market forces are something to be harnessed or resisted depending on what circumstance requires, not an evil to be despised or abolished. The challenge for politicians is striking a balance between what is permitted, what is encouraged, what is denounced and what is outlawed in markets. The case of BHS is just the latest to prove that the balance has not properly been struck. To leave it without redress will lead to more economic failures which, in time, will bring politics itself further into disrepute – a most dangerous trajectory.",REAL
The Guardian view on Spain’s political impasse: no relief yet in sight,"Last December’s general election was supposed to give Spain – weary of austerity, fed up with scandals and tired of incumbents who seemed to have been around too long – a political new start. But the paradoxical result of the rise of two parties promising fresh approaches to the country’s problems has been paralysis, not forward movement. After months of squabbling and manoeuvring, King Felipe last week gave up his efforts to persuade the politicians to agree on a coalition which could rule the country, and there will now be new elections in late June. The awkward arithmetic of the December vote meant that a coalition would only be possible if principles were sacrificed to practicality by one or more of the players. The trouble is that the compromises explored in the attempts to form a viable coalition diluted the very message which excited voters in December – that deals and fixes would become things of the past – yet the failure to agree confirmed the contrasting view that politicians were putting their own interests before those of the country. If there were an easy way out in the shape of the new elections then that could be a solution, but the polls suggest that although there will be some shifts in the share of votes, the next vote may well lead to another deadlock. It is obvious that neither the voters nor the parties, old and new, wanted this outcome. Voters for the two mainstream parties wanted&nbsp;the familiar political balance and alternation that has characterised Spain since&nbsp;the 1980s. Voters for the two upstart parties, Podemos and Ciudadanos, wanted different things. Podemos emphasised an end&nbsp;to austerity, popular participation, and&nbsp;an assault on neoliberalism. Just as Podemos represented an attempt to renew the left, Ciudadanos constituted an attempt at renewal on the right, with a particular stress on clean government. In 2006, the party launched a campaign in which its leader Albert Rivera appeared naked to emphasise the idea of a new, clean party being born. In the 2015 election both the new left and the new right did well, but the old left and the old right proved resilient, in each case gaining more votes than their rivals – many more, in the case of the ruling People’s party. To quote a Podemos favourite, Antonio Gramsci, “the old is dying and the new cannot be born”. The two left parties did not have enough seats to govern together; nor did the two parties of the right. The two old parties, the People’s party and the Socialists, would have had the seats to govern, but refused to form a grand coalition. The Socialists could have joined with both the two new parties, but this threesome repeatedly failed to find enough common ground. The favourite Spanish word for the resulting muddle is circo, or circus. It is not as if Spain can afford to fiddle around for much longer in this way. The country urgently needs an agreement on Catalonia, where a separatist government has been pressing for an independence referendum. Only Podemos has been ready to consider the Catalan demand. Then there is austerity, opposition to which was the original trigger for Spain’s new politics. It has not gone away, as recent Brussels warnings over Spain’s growing deficit show. Somebody needs to be in charge if these and other pressing issues are to be tackled effectively, yet the prospects of that happening soon are not good.",REAL
Child refugees in camps from Lesbos to Calais need more help,"There are an estimated 26,000 child refugees in Europe as a result of recent international crises. Many are living in conditions of absolute desperation – hungry, cold, scared and, according to Europol, increasingly exposed to trafficking and sexual exploitation. We were therefore extremely disappointed that a proposal to accept 3,000 refugee children was defeated in the Commons. The proposal has been on the table since the middle of last year. During that time, it is estimated that at least 10,000 displaced children have gone missing after entering Europe. Our government’s response to the plight of children, isolated and afraid in makeshift camps from Lesbos to Calais, should be focused entirely on their best interest. Increasing aid to the regions in conflict is well and good. But ignoring children already in Europe – or cheese-paring our support through lengthy bureaucratic processes – is simply unacceptable. Allowing child refugees to be left in inhuman and dangerous conditions is not only against the spirit and letter of universal and European human rights conventions, the convention on the rights of the child to which the UK is signatory, and the UK’s Children Act. It risks undermining the UK’s moral authority in the quest to confront radicalisation and build international security. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health urges the government to reconsider its decision, take a leadership role within Europe in addressing the larger crisis of unaccompanied child refugees and, for those refugee children already residing in the UK, facilitate the reunification of all children separated from family. Bhanu Williams (Global officer), Professor Neena Modi (President), Sebastian Taylor (Head of global operations) Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health • Liz Clegg is a fantastic example of the British people helping in Calais (Report, 29 April). Save the Children has trained 100 brilliant volunteers working in the Calais refugee camp in psychological first aid, sharing our experience of helping traumatised victims of war. Save the Children funds grassroots charities in Calais, including Jungle Books Library and Baloo’s Youth Centre, which works with hundreds of vulnerable children in the camp, and supports Help Refugees Citizens UK in its excellent work. Our focus in Calais is the lone children who are forced to gamble – and sometimes lose – their lives, trying to reach their family. Improving conditions in the camp is crucial, but we need more than a plaster on the catastrophic wound in Europe’s refugee response. The camp has become a no man’s land between the fifth and sixth richest nations, and requires a political solution. That’s why we’re asking the government to match its tremendous leadership of aid for the long-running Syria crisis with help for just 3,000 refugee children already in Europe. These children have a choice between the traffickers or the train tracks. MPs can offer them hope and safety when the child refugee vote returns to the Commons – it would be to their eternal credit if they did.

Donald Trump and Ted Cruz stump in Indiana after Obama drops the mic – as it happened,"Sanders is taking questions from the press. “The ideas we are fighting for are the future of the Democratic party and indeed the future of this country,” Bernie Sanders tells reporters at the National Press Club in Washington DC. He mentions climate change, “grotesque” wealth inequality, reforming taxes for corporations and the richest Americans, education and healthcare – the many progressive issues of his campaign. Then he talks about delegate math. A Democratic candidate needs 2,083 “It is virtually impossible for Secretary Clinton to reach the majority of delegates by June 14, that is the last day a primary will be held,” he says, “with pledged delegates alone. She will need superdelegates to take her over the top at the convention in Philadelphia.” “In other words the convention will be a contested contest.” “There are 10 states remaining where we’re going to be vigorously competing,” he adds, plus several territories. He says he needs 65% of the remaining delegates to win. We intend to fight for every vote in front of us and every vote remaining.” He then talks about superdelegates: “Obviously we are taking on virtually the entire Democratic establishment.” Of the 719 superdelegates, he says, many committed themselves to Clinton before the campaign began a year ago. “While we have won 45% of the pledged delegates in real campaigns where the people have spoken,” he says, “we have won only 7% of the superdelegates.” “Those superdelegates where states where either candidate has won a landslide victories, those superdelegates ought to seriously reflect on whether they ought to cast their superdelegate vote in align[ment] with the wishes of the people of those states.” Secondly, he says, he and Clinton disagree on many things: trade, breaking up banks, the rate of minimum wage hikes, a carbon tax, fracking, etc. “But where Secretary Clinton and I strongly agree, and where every delegate to the Democratic convention strongly agrees, is that it would be a disaster to this country if Donald Trump or some other rightwing Republican were to become president of the United States.” He spins this call to unity into an argument that he “stands the better chance of defeating Donald Trump and other Republican candidates”. Bernie Sanders is due to speak in Washington DC in the next few minutes, a year on from his campaign announcement. My colleague Dan Roberts is reporting from the scene. “If we win in Indiana, it’s all over,” Trump promises. “We’re going to get there anyway. And then we can focus on Crooked Hillary, please, let’s focus on Hillary.” He goes on for a bit about the delegate system – he needs 1,237 delegates to clinch the Republican nomination. He says he’ll have “five, six million more votes” than Ted Cruz or John Kasich, and “like five or six hundred delegates more”. “Because there was 17 people you couldn’t get [to 1,237 because] there was all those early states,” Trump says. But none of it matters: “We don’t play the second ballot game, we’re only playing to win.” Then he ridicules Cruz a little more. “The first time in the history of politics that a man who cannot win because he has no path,” Trump says, “and he’s choosing a vice president.” “He has no path to victory!” He also says that he wants to get to general election business. “We want to raise money for the party,” he says, alluding to those looming Senate and House races that have moderate Republicans terrified of losing their seat. He’d rather do that “instead of wasting our time”. You don’t have to be a good student,” Trump tells the crowd. “You don’t even have to be smart. It doesn’t help us.” Then he talks about how much he’s won, eg “I won with women! I won big!” Stat guru Harry Enten, of FiveThirtyEight, notes that Trump is not really winning in the polls outside of the Republican primary. But Trump is enjoying talking, not reading Harry’s tweets. He says he’s really glad to have the endorsement of businessman Carl Icahn and Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions. “Even I was surprised!” “I watched Lindsey Graham on television this morning,” Trump continues, before he loses his train of thought. He says he’s knocked 17 rivals out of the race, except for two. “They’re like hanging by their fingertips.” Then he mocks Ted Cruz for announcing that former HP CEO Carly Fiorina would be his running-mate. “Let me choose Carly, maybe that will turn it around,” Trump says. It’s much more impressive, according to the businessman, to have an endorsement from Bobby Knight, the college basketball coach as legendary for his violent outbursts (and alleged assaults on players) as his winning teams. Then he’s back onto Cruz and the third candidate in the race, John Kasich. “I refuse to call them the leftovers, it’s not respectful,” Trump says, not refusing at all. He flails his arms and turns his ovoice into a whine: “The two guys that are hanging by their fingernails. ‘Don’t let me fall! Don’t let me fall!’” “And then,” he growls into the mic, “we go after ‘Crooked Hillary,’ folks!” Donald Trump is speaking in Terre Haute, Indiana, and the rally is off to its typical rambling start. He talks about how he gets “great ratings” for the cable shows, even though he’s only been on one such show in several weeks. He says the press are “extremely dishonest people”. He talks about how he went to California on Friday and spoke for thousands of people. He talks about protests against him, but he doesn’t call them protests: “these thugs were jumping onto these cars.” “These guys should be put in jail for five years they’ll never do it again I promise.” He loves the police, by the way, has he mentioned that? Beautiful police. He says business executives and foreign leaders “are like grand chessmasters” while in the US “we’re like checker players”. He segues from our “stupid” leaders’ concern about global warming to talk about a kind of global warming that he does fear, “it’s made of the nuclear variety, that’s the one we have to be careful of.” The audience doesn’t sound like it’s sure how to react to this, since it’s not clear what nuclear global warming is. He doesn’t mention it now, but Trump has also previously suggested it would be a good idea to let South Korea, Japan and other nations develop their own nuclear weapons, even though he fears “the nuclear” more than anything else. “I’m worried about one thing: America first, we’re going to put America first.” America First was a non-interventionist movement led, in part, by famous aviator Charles Lindbergh in the years before World War II. Lindberg was such an admirer of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime in Berlin that before the war broke out he intended to move there. Donald Trump does not appear to know anything about Charles Lindbergh or the historical antecedents of the phrase “America first”. He also spoke a bit about football. Donald Trump’s son Eric vowed that he and his father will get the last laugh, after Barack Obama cracked a string of jokes at the Republican frontrunner’s expense on Saturday night. Per the Hill: “We’ll take some shots back next year. He who laughs last laughs longest, right?” Trump said to The Hill in the reception area before the annual dinner event. “I’d be shocked if [Obama] didn’t [take shots at Donald],” Eric Trump’s wife, Lara Yunaska, said. Eric Trump, the executive vice president of development and acquisitions at The Trump Organization, seemed excited for his first visit to the soiree. “I build hotels,” said Trump. “We don’t do politics. This is uncharted territory to me.” The artist of a nude painting of Donald Trump says she was punched by a Trump supporter in Los Angeles and filed a police report. She has previously said that she was threatened with legal action over the painting, which is not anatomically charitable to the Republican frontrunner. The Los Angeles Police Department did not immediately confirm to the Guardian whether a police report was filed, and the artist did not answer a phone number listed to her name. From Illma Gore’s Instagram post. Today I was punched in the face by a man who got out of his car and yelled, “Trump 2016!” in Los Angeles, just days after I returned home from London just down the road from my house. Though I encourage passion, opinion and emotion, especially though art, I think violence is disgusting. To live in a place where Facebook has given my address to an anonymous third party makes me feel like I am homeless again. This type of violence makes creatives feel like we live in a world where our individual creative input isn’t safe. I am sad that this is the state of our America right now. I am sad that Trump, and many of his supporters, don’t find words enough to express their opinions - they need walls, waterboarding and punches.@realdonaldtrump Please stop glamorizing and perpetuating violence. Make America Decent Again!#makeamericadecentagain No, they have not been caught, and the men drove off laughing. A detailed police report has been filed. The Republican frontrunner did not spend his morning facing a carousel of journalists, but he did use campaign time to watch the shows anyway. Far away, from the East Wing of the White House, an update on the first family’s plans for when they’re well away from politics. Senator Lindsey Graham, a former presidential candidate and one of the most vocal anti-Trump Republicans, is next on the CBS program. He minces no words: “Lucifer is the only person Trump could beat in a general election.” Graham now supports Ted Cruz, though he once compared the choice between Trump and Cruz to “being shot or poisoned”. “Trumpism will get creamed in the ballot box,” Graham says. “There’s a civil war going on in the Republican party, I hope and pray that Ted Cruz, who’s a reliable conservative, can carry the banner.” Graham defines Trumpism as a “cult of a strongman that absolutely is nowhere near conservatism”. The senator describes Trump’s plan to deport 11 million undocumented people as “unworkable and hateful” and his foreign policy as “the siren song of isolationism”. Graham sits on the Senate’s committee of foreign relations and says that Trump’s foreign policy ideas ignore past mistakes by the US. He says Japan and South Korea are not “freeriders” but “valuable allies”, that “globalization is here to stay”, and that the US needs Muslim Americans and partners abroad to fight terrorism. “Our failure was not to follow through” in Libya and Iraq, Graham argues, blaming the president for withdrawing forces from the latter. He ends with a desperate plea to his colleagues in Republican politics: reject Trump, be your own person, get as far away as possible or lose your seat in Congress. Bernie Sanders is appearing on CBS’s Face the Nation, with host John Dickerson. Dickerson asks whether Sanders has any realistic chance left to win the nomination “It’s difficult, it’s not impossible,” Sanders insists. He says his campaign needs 65% of the remaining delegates. “California happens to be perhaps the most progressive state in this country, they have the most delegates.” California votes on 7 June. Sanders repeats a familiar argument that he’s best placed to defeat Donald Trump. If the Democrats want to win in November, he says, hinting toward superdelegats, “if they want the campaign that has the energy, the excitement, the young people,” then they should be turning to team Sanders. He says that superdelegates, aka party officials who are free to vote as they please in the party’s convention, are not inherently unfair. “What’s unfair is even before I get into the campaign Hillray Clinton has some four, five hundred superdelegates on her side.” Then he starts talking about bigger ambitions – an echo of last week, when he said his campaign is “the future of the Democratic party”, and a departure from his many vows to win the nomination. Sanders maintains that he is the candidate representing working people, but argues that his underdog campaign is doing a net good for Democrats by continuing its fight with Hillary Clinton. “I believe that it is good for American democracy when we have a vigorous debate on the issues, and I believe that it is good for the Democratic party when we have a vigorous debate on the issues,” he says. He assures Dickerson that his supporters will come into the eventual fold: “of course the party needs to be unified and it will be unified after the convention in July.” But he also asserts that “looking at the status quo,” the American people are dissatisfied. “They’re looking at the nation, and they’re saying as a nation we can do much better, and we can have real change.” Finally Todd gets round to asking Cruz a perennially awkward question: after all this talk bashing Donald Trump, would you support him if he’s the nominee? Cruz makes a familiar dodge: “I believe if the Republican Party nominates Donald Trump we will lose to Hillary, because when we offer Democrat-lite.” Todd: All right. All right. All right. Can you support him? He tries hard to just get a yes or no out of Cruz. He points out it’s about votes and delegates, not “the media”, and that it doesn’t matter whether Cruz can beat Hillary Clinton if he can’t beat Trump. “Republican voters are the ones rejecting you,” Todd says. “This is not a media conspiracy, senator. The senator suggests maybe it is a conspiracy. “With all due respect, the media has given $2bn of free advertising to Donald. Well, let me ask you a question, for example. How much money did the networks make on every one of the Republican debates?” Todd has no idea, because he doesn’t run the business side of NBC, which didn’t air a Republican debate, much less boss of the other networks that aired debates. “Why won’t you answer that question – black – straightforward, black and white?” Cruz doesn’t give up: “your network’s executives are partisan Democrats,” he says, without any evidence to support the generalization. “The simple reality is the media, almost entirely, are liberal, partisan, Democrats. That is the reality of it. The media created this Trump phenomenon, and then – and then they don’t hold him accountable. Now, I’m sure the media plan to do so if he’s the nominee in the general election. “Suddenly you’re gonna hear every day about Donald Trump’s tax returns. When was the last time you talked about his tax returns? You-- you know, we ought to have a debate. There are real differences. Donald won’t debate and the media won’t hold him accountable. I think the people of Indiana deserve a debate…” The verbal contortions are extraordinary. He jumps from one diversionary talking point – the media, debates, etc – to another. “Listen, this is my kids’ future, Chuck. It’s not – it’s not simply a game,” he says. Todd: “Nobody’s saying it’s a game.” Cruz says that “if we lose this we lose our country.” Even though Todd points out that Republican voters are rejecting him for Donald Trump and even John Kasich, he refuses to conceive of a United States that does not want Ted Cruz. “I’m not willing to give up on America.” Todd: “So let the record show, you have not taken a position on whether Trump-- whether you can support Trump if he’s the nominee. Fair enough?” He asked him nine times. Cruz did not answer. Then Todd asks Cruz about comments by the former Republican Speaker of the House, John Boehner, who this week called Cruz “Lucifer in the flesh” and the most “miserable son of a bitch” he ever worked with. Cruz claims he doesn’t know John Boehner, even though Boehner led the Republican party in Congress for years while Cruz served in the Senate, and, as third in line to the presidency, was an extremely important person for anyone in Washington DC to know. “Number one, I don’t know John Boehner. The two of us haven’t said 50 words to each other in our entire lives.” What? Cruz engineered a government shutdown that Boehner helped lead… “It’s actually a good illustration,” Cruz claims. He says he asked Senator Mike Lee and Beohner to join him, and – according to Cruz – Boehner said, “No interest. No value. I’m not willing to talk to you.” “So I don’t know him at all. But what was interesting about Boehner’s comments is he praised Hillary Clinton. He thinks she’s terrific.” Boehner and Clinton and Trump “are the Washington cartel. It is the corruption of Washington,” Cruz says. He keeps developing this conspiratorial theory. “Donald and Hillary are the ultimate Washington insiders. They have been enmeshed in the corruption. If you like John Boehner, if you want a presidential candidate like John Boehner, then Donald Trump is your candidate.” He thinks Boehner “was auditioning” to be Trump’s vice-president – an unlikely move for a man who appeared in a comedic skit with Barack Obama last night. Todd presses Cruz on the point, noting that taxes on the wealthiest have gone up, and so have jobs. “How do you explain that?” Cruz says he’s wrong, even though the US has consistently surpassed expectations regarding unemployment in recent years. “Job creation has not gone up, Chuck. We have the lowest percentage of Americans working of any year since 1977. The Obama-Clinton economy is a disaster…” Todd checks him: “we’re in a six-year expansion right now.” Well, it’s pretty slow, Cruz tries. “Millions of Americans are hurting. Income inequality has increased dramatically. Now, you know who is doing well? The rich. The Obama-Clinton economy has been very good for the Donald Trumps and Hillary Clintons of the world.” Then Cruz, who himself is a millionaire and married to an executive at Goldman Sachs, tries on a populist costume. “The top 1% today earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.” “If you go to our rallies, if you see who’s comin’ out, it’s the single mom. It’s the steel worker. It’s the truck driver. It’s the student. It’s Hispanics. It’s the people who are struggling to climb the economic ladder, who Washington ignores. That’s who we need to be fighting for. I recognize that Wall Street and the lobbyists in K Street are doin’ great under big government. But the rest of America is being ignored by Washington.” Todd changes subject. He notes that Cruz’s new running-mate, Carly Fiorina, was not so long ago saying “Ted Cruz is like any other politician” who “says whatever he needs to say to get elected, and then he’s gonna do as he pleases.” Cruz says it was all in good spirit back when Fiorina was his adversary in the Republican primary. She’s endorsed him for a full seven weeks – might as well be years. Then he touts her business experience. She had a controversial and short tenure at the head of Hewlett Packard, but Cruz doesn’t mention that. “With Carly it’s the complete package. I was looking for someone who could be a partner. You know, I’ve never understood people who just want a ceremonial vice president.” Todd tries something a little more direct. He asks Cruz whether he’s brought on Fiorina as a means of winning over women who object to Trump’s objectifying and derogatory language about women. Cruz takes the bait. He points out that Trump is endorsed by former boxer Mike Tyson, whom Cruz describes as “a convicted rapist who served three years in prison here in Indiana for rape”. “You know what, Chuck? I don’t think rapists are tough guys. I think they’re weak, I think they’re bullies, I think they’re cowards. And it says something if Donald Trump thinks that a convicted rapist a tough guy. “He’s proud of Mike Tyson’s support, I’m proud of Carly Fiorina and, and Mike Pence’s support. And that is as clear a contrast for the people of Indiana and the people of this country as you could ask for.” Todd follows up, asking what Cruz make’s of Trump’s comment that Hillary Clinton is playing “the woman card”. “It’s typical Donald Trump,” Cruz says. “The only thing he knows how to do in any given circumstance is he yells, he screams, he curses, or he insults. So there he’s insulting Hillary. Listen, Hillary is a very smart, committed liberal. Her policies are profoundly wrong. The he says Trump secretly supports her policies: “Donald and Hillary, they’re flipsides of the same coin. They’ve both gotten rich exploiting Washington, exploiting government power.” Ted Cruz is now on NBC’s Meet the Press, where host Chuck Todd asks him about his somewhat dubious ability to unify Republicans. Cruz says that that’s exactly what he’s doing, saying that even though Donald Trump won five large states in the north-east last week, he himself won five (much smaller) states in the weeks before, out west. Then he touts his new runningmate, Carly Fiorina, and an endorsement of Indiana’s governor, Mike Pence, “a strong, principled conservative”. “That is really an illustration of how the party is coming together. And I think the people of Indiana, the entire country is looking to Indiana. And I think the country is really depending on Indiana,” he says. So how important is Indiana, Todd asks. “Indiana is an important state,” Cruz replies. “We are competing hard. We’re barnstorming the state. We’re on a bus tour, Heidi and I and the girls and Carly.” Todd: So if Indiana rejects you, they’re rejecting that argument, are they not? Cruz says he doesn’t think so. He thinks his support “is surging”. He stumps a little about jobs and wages, and adds: “Donald’s only economic agenda is imposing massive taxes on the American people with a 40% tax hike of a giant tariff. That would send us into a recession. It would drive jobs overseas. It would kill small businesses.” Then he compares himself to Ronald Reagan and JFK both, saying not entirely correctly that they cut taxes and lifted regulations on small business. Wallace asks Trump about Barack Obama’s mockery of him at the White House Correspondents Dinner. The president joked at Trump’s expense at length, including a quip that Trump would be great at shutting down Guantánamo Bay. “Trump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground.” Trump didn’t mind Obama’s jokes at all. “I think it’s fine, it’s a comedy, it’s fine.” “I guess I’m good at something because I’ve made more than $10bn and I started with a $1m loan.” Finally Wallace asks Trump about Indiana, the next state to vote. Governor Mike Pence gave a lukewarm endorsement to Ted Cruz this week, and Cruz has tried to use boxer Mike Tyson’s support for Trump against him. Trump doesn’t really care. “I haven’t seen Mike in years,” he says. Cruz is “the greatest liar that ever lived except he gets caught all the time.” Wallace turns to foreign policy – Trump gave a speech this week billed as a detailed policy plan. It was not entirely coherent. The Fox News host asks Trump about his philosophy of “America first”, a more isolationist stance toward the world that would concentrate on domestic spending and avoid intervention abroad. He asks Trump whether he would prefer to keep autocratic strongmen, like Egypt’s ex-president Hosni Mubarak and Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, to the troubled revolutions that deposed those men. Trump seems to conflate Mubarak with Gaddafi, and doesn’t mention Egypt, which is specifically what Wallace asked about. “You have a mess. You have a big fat mess,” he says. “When you knock out Iraq you’re going to ruin the balance.” “What we’ve done in the Middle East, we’ve spent $4 trillion and we’re far worse than when the first gunshot was fired.” He gets back to domestic problems. “We have to rebuild our country. Our country is becoming third world,” he says, comparing China’s trains that travel “300mph” to American railroads. “We have the Long Island Railroad, and it can hardly – it can hardly move.” Wallace gets him back to foreign policy, but Trump quickly goes on a tangent: “Isis now has Libyan oil, you know it’s among the finest oil in the world … And if we would’ve left Gaddafi, we wouldn’t have had that.” Then he boasts about his lack of notable foreign policy advisors. “I don’t want the people that’ve been involved for 15 years because those are the people what they’ve absolutely done to this country, and our country.” Wallace: So is it far to say that Hillary Clinton will be the hawk in this race and you’ll be the dove? “No I’ll tell you what I will be much tougher than her, I will have much more respect,” Trump insists, ignoring the point about intervention versus reputation. He says he’s glad to hear that foreign leaders are a little alarmed about his success. “Let them be a little concerned.” “We’re like the policemen to the world, what’s going on is crazy.” Donald Trump is ending a long hiatus from the Sunday shows to appear on Fox News Sunday, with host Chris Wallace. It’s been almost a month since Trump appeared on any of the shows, which were long one of his favorite weekend activities. Wallace asks about sometimes violent protests at Trump rallies, including in California on Friday. “It was like a love fest for an hour and a half,” Trump says of the California protests. “I didn’t even see the riots, you know these are wise guys that stomp on policemen’s cars.” Trump was forced from his motorcade by protesters at one point on Friday. “These were professional agitators,” he continues, alluding to protesters that night. “These people have to be dealt with very strongly because you can’t allow that to happen to a police car.” “But this was an amazing evening,” he insists. “A record-setting crowd, and nobody even saw it.” Wallace points out the general election is “a different deal” – that Trump is hugely disliked by Hispanic Americans and women voters beyond the Republican primary. “Those numbers are going way up once I start going. I have two more people to get rid of,” he says. “Once I start on Hillary you’ll see the numbers change.” He says his record of success in the Republican primary is a sign of how he’ll do in the future. “One by one I won. Watch what happens with Hillary and watch what happens with my numbers.” He says he’s been “hit with 55,000 negative ads” and hasn’t been affected. What about Hillary Clinton, Wallace asks – a Fox News host defending her – she was a senator, she was secretary of state, “to say if she were a man she would get 5%, isn’t that kind of dismissive?” “The fact is the only card she has is the woman’s card,” Trump says. “Even women don’t like her.” “I don’t think she’ll play it well at all. And it’s true. If she were not a woman she wouldn’t even be in this race.” Bernie Sanders has announced yet another extraordinary month of fundraising, raising $25.8m in April. The senator has routinely broke fundraising records with small donations, which he often touts on the campaign trail as a sign of his “political revolution”. From the campaign: Since the Sanders campaign was launched one year ago, his supporters have revolutionized campaign fundraising and demonstrated that he can wage a competitive campaign for president without relying on Wall Street and other special interests. More than 7.4 million contributions have poured in from more than 2.4 million donors totaling $210 million. A key to Sanders’ fundraising success has been that his grassroots supporters consistently have contributed more to his campaign than Hillary Clinton’s big-dollar donors. Sanders’ April donations far exceeded Hillary for America’s $21 million in March. “What our campaign is doing is bringing millions of Americans into the political process,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager. “Sanders is the candidate with the most energy and excitement. He is the candidate with the best chance of winning in November. He is the candidate who is in the best position to bring a new generation of voters into the democratic process and restore the faith of working-class voters that we can have a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.” Sanders’ average contribution was a little less than $26, the campaign said, boasting that teachers, students, engineers and young people make up the largest blocs of donors. It’s an implicit rebuke of Clinton, who has received a large number of contributions from people who work in finance, law or are retired. Republican Ted Cruz is next up on the CNN program. CcHost Jake Tapper immediately notes comments by former Speaker of the House John Boehner – Republicans’ long-time leader in Congress. Boehner said Cruz was “Lucifer in the flesh”. Cruz immediately notes how he’s gotten an endorsement from Indiana’s governor, Mike Pence, and his new running-mate Carly Fiorina. He waxes grateful. Tapper turns it on him: doesn’t picking Fiorina this early, months before the convention and hundreds of delegates away from the nomination, smack of desperation? Cruz says that’s exactly what Trump wants you to think. “He either yells, screams, curses or insults, so it’s no surprise he went with insult.” “This is an unusual election but I think it’s important to give the voters a clear contrast, a clear choice, between Carly and me on the one hand and Donald and Hillary” on the other, he says. “They’re flipsides of the same coin. They agree with each other on issue after issue after issue,” Cruz goes on. “They’re both Washington insiders.” “Trump has made billions buying politicians like Hillary Clinton,” he says, lumping in Boehner for good measure. “They’re all part of the same corrupt Washington system. Where the rich get richer.” Cruz’s new populist argument is a tricky one to make: he is a millionaire lawyer married to a Goldman Sachs financier and running for president alongside a millionaire former CEO. Tapper then asks Cruz about his support for a North Carolina law that requires transgender people use the bathroom of the gender they were assigned at birth. “The law doesn’t specify transgender it’s whatever you feel like at the given moment,” Cruz says, arguing that although transgender people might not threaten children, the anti-discrimination rules that protect them could somehow leave children vulnerable to predators. Hillary Clinton is the first candidate to speak this morning, on CNN’s State of the Union with host Jake Tapper. It’s a pre-taped interview, the only one Clinton has given since her victory in four of five states that voted last Tuesday. Do you consider yourself the presumptive nominee, she’s asked. “No,” she says, adding that she’s “on the path” and doesn’t want to take anything for granted. Tapper then asks her about Bernie Sanders’ turn toward changing the agenda of the democratic party, rather than winning the nomination outright. “There comes a time where you have to look at the reality,” Clinton replies. “I certainly look forward to working with Senator Sanders,” she says, promising that “it will be a progressive platform.” “I really welcome his ideas and his supporters’ passion and commitment, because the most important thing for us is for us to win in November,” she adds. The “primary objective”, she says, is “to make sure that Donald Trump is not president. Clinton commiserates with Sanders and his supporters. “It’s hard,” she says. “You throw yourself into these campaigns body and soul, you work 24/7.” Then she essentially thanks Sanders for his contributions: bringing people into the party, and being “a passionate advocate for the issues he feels passionately about”. “We have far more in common,” she says, “than Donald Trump.” Trump’s policy ideas are “disturbing”, she says, noting his proposals to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the US and to create a religious registry. “I know that the stakes are high, that we face some real challenges and dangers in the world,” she says, but “I don’t think pretending you have some kind of secret plan is a smart way of leading.” Asked about Trump’s more isolationist tendencies, Clinton assures Tapper: “I’m always someone who uses military force as a last resort.” Asked about some of Trump’s remarks – about a “woman card” and “crooked Hillary” – she says she doesn’t respond to attacks. “I think it’s kind of silly,” she adds, noting that she’s been twice elected to the Senate, has two million more votes overall than Trump, and won Ohio and Pennsylvania by higher margins than he won in the Republican primary. “I had a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and the way they speak,” she says. “I’m not going to deal with their temper tantrums or their bullying.” “I could [sic] really care less.” In a hint at some of her anti-Trump tactics to come, she notes that Trump’s proposals are almost always extremely vague. “There’s nothing secret about what I want to d,” she says. “I’ve laid it all out there. And he can’t. Or he won’t. I can’t tell which. … Or he can continue on his insult fest. That’s a choice he’s making.” Tapper turns to a bit of policy himself. He asks about trade deals that Trump and Sanders have criticized at length for hurting manufacturing jobs. “They were mixed. They helped a lot of people and they hurt people,” Clinton says. “One of the problems in our country is we don’t do enough to help people who are hurt.” Finally the host asks her about how she and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, attended the wedding of Donald and Melania Trump. Clinton laughs, and grins when she says that it “never crossed my mind” that she could ever be running for president against the businessman. Hello and welcome to our rolling coverage of the 2016 primary election, the day after Barack Obama literally dropped the mic on Republicans, Democrats and the press, and only two days out from the crucial Indiana primary, which is likely the last realistic chance to block a former reality TV star from a clear path to his party’s nomination. Donald Trump needs 1,237 delegates to clinch the Republican nomination at the party’s convention in July, and party leaders in New Hampshire and elsewhere are trying to pack their contingents with anti-Trump Republicans. Trump’s main rival, Texas senator Ted Cruz, has meanwhile invested huge efforts into Indiana, a state with politics so conservative that its voters may yet choose the widely loathed senator over the nationally disliked businessman. Trump did not attend the White House correspondents dinner on Saturday night, although he’s been a guest before. “Is this dinner too tacky for the Donald?” Obama asked the crowd. “What could he possibly be doing instead? Is he at home eating a Trump steak, tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel? What’s he doing?” Polls suggest the race is close: Cruz’s well-organized team has tended to over-perform in states such as Indiana, and the state’s rules mean whoever wins takes most of the delegates. Cruz himself will appear on nearly every Sunday talk show this morning to press his case that somehow he can be both America’s most conservative leader and a unifying, definitely-not-despised-by-colleagues force in American politics. The Texas senator was not spared Obama’s mockery, especially for his talk of a “basketball ring” earlier this week. “What else is in his lexicon? Baseball sticks? Football hats? But, sure, I’m the foreign one.” Cruz is also hampered by John Kasich, a third Republican candidate who trails by a huge margin in the race and who has lured more moderate conservatives to his comparatively more moderate cause. Without any realistic chance at the nomination, Kasich has largely been ignored by party leaders such as former House Speaker John Boehner and Senator Lindsey Graham. This week Boehner called Cruz “Lucifer in the flesh”. On the Democratic side of the race, underdog Bernie Sanders has lost nearly any mathematical chance at the nomination in terms of pledged and unpledged delegates. He has vowed to continue the race through its final stages, however, and already turned toward converting his remarkable success – he often notes that he started a year ago at 3% in the polls – into a progressive agenda for the Democratic party at large. Obama joked that the 74-year-old Sanders is “the bright new face of the Democratic party”. “I am hurt, though, Bernie, that you’ve been distancing yourself a little from me. I mean, that’s just not something that you do to your comrade.” The democratic socialist senator from Vermont began his campaign exactly one year ago today (May Day), and his mission may yet prove a defining factor even should the frontrunner secure the nomination, as seems likely. That frontrunner, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, has already turned her attention away from Sanders and toward Trump and the general election. Clinton has given a rare exclusive interview to CNN this morning, and will likely have to field questions about her thoughts on a potential running mate, even though the party remains months from the convention. Obama didn’t spare his erstwhile cabinet member from a little teasing, and alluded to her hard road ahead uniting Sanders’ passionate base of young people. “You’ve got to admit it though, Hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative who just signed up for Facebook. “Obama out”, the president declared on Saturday night, at ease with his nearing departure from the White House. We’re in it for the long haul, so follow along to see how Trump, Cruz, Sanders and Clinton try to edge each other, redefine politics – and react to the presidential gibes at their expense.",REAL
Green zone protests raise questions over viability of Iraq's government,"For 13 years, Baghdad’s green zone had been off limits to nearly all Iraqis; a place where wars have been run, power has been bitterly contested and from where the country’s unaccountable leaders have filleted its finances. It had all taken place behind blast walls and barriers that gave the area, on the north bank of the Tigris river, an opaque and remote feel. The authority of the Iraqi state has long been centred in the green zone, even under Saddam Hussein, whose palaces were commandeered first by the US military, and now by Iraq’s leaders. Not anymore. In one afternoon, the fragility of state control was exposed by the power of the street – and by a cleric who for several months earlier had shadow-boxed with the Iraqi leadership. With cover from their leader, Moqtada al-Sadr, thousands of men simply walked past soldiers who did not want to confront them, then ransacked the parliament and assaulted all the non-Sadrist MPs they could find. Iraq’s legislature had three time refused to agree to reforms that would replace a corrupt cabinet with technocrats who could make vital changes without political, or personal, considerations. And, judging by the chaotic scenes of last week where the prime minister, Haidar al-Abadi, was chased from the floor of the parliament by MPs insisting on the status quo, that was not going to change. The defiance belied the crisis Iraq faces on multiple levels. Plunging oil revenues mean it will probably be unable to pay its bloated public sector payroll next year, a scenario that has sparked an overdue reckoning of systemic corruption and poor governance. Sectarian divisions, which have become ever more evident in the political system, have damaged the country’s capacity to tackle a second existential threat, the rise of Islamic State – which claimed responsibility for a bomb attack that left at least 31 people dead in the southern Iraqi city of Samawah on Sunday. Without the lead role of non-state actors, such as Shia militias, Iran and US-led airstrikes, the terror group might have overrun Baghdad, just as it did four other cities: Mosul, Tikrit, Ramadi and Fallujah. At every turn, in the past five years in particular, the state has been unable to stand up for itself. The growing spectre of yet another issue, this time a financial crisis, that could have been avoided with the most basic of governance, has forced many to confront issues that could be, and were, buried during better times. At issue now, is the very viability of Iraq, as it was envisaged both by the neoconservative war planners in 2002, who saw a democratic, pluralistic utopia emerging from the US invasion, and by those who founded the modern state nearly 95 years ago, assembling disparate groups under the banner of a nation state. For the first time in the 13 years since the US invasion gave power to the majority Shia sect at the expense of the minority Sunnis, public officials are starting to talk openly about a future state that is not bound by the same borders or political system. Partition had been almost a taboo topic among the country’s political class, even during the worst of the sectarian war from 2006-07 and the early months of the Isis onslaught in 2014. Last year, however, Ali al-Sistani, the highest authority in Iraqi Shia Islam, publicly said such an outcome was possible, if reforms were not made. Sistani, a recluse, who throughout his life has rarely delved into politics, has been increasingly forthright in pushing Abadi to introduce change. Those close to Sistani say the 87-year-old sees the crisis as a last chance for the modern state, and for nationalists who want to keep it together. Throughout the Baghdad establishment there is an increasing fear that restoring meaningful unity may already be out of reach. Iraq, as it is now, is all but ungovernable, with vested interests holding sway over reformists, and with militias having primacy over state institutions. The greater fear is what this might all mean for the region. The consideration now for Iraq, as well as its allies and foes, is whether continuing to pretend it is working is a better option than acknowledging it isn’t.",REAL
Protesters in Iraq's green zone begin to withdraw,"Up to 5,000 demonstrators who set up camp in the heart of Baghdad’s fortified green zone began to leave after protest leaders delivered an ultimatum that called for an overhaul of Iraq’s crippled government, and vowed to return if reforms failed. The withdrawal on Sunday was ordered by senior leaders of the Sadrist movement, whose members had walked past soldiers into the most secure part of the Iraqi capital over the weekend, in the most dramatic challenge to state authority in post-Saddam Iraq. As they trickled from the heart of Iraqi power, the Sadrist leaders, who are loyal to the powerful Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, demanded an urgent parliamentary session to form a new cabinet. Failing that, they insisted on the sacking of the prime minister, Haider al-Abadi; the president, Fuad Masum; and the speaker, Salim al-Jabouri, as well as new elections. Observers said implacable divisions within Iraq’s parliament – which has rejected a reform programme introduced by an embattled Abadi three times – have made it close to impossible to agree to reforms, meaning the crisis is likely to escalate again. Soldiers who guard the green zone stood aside as senior members of the powerful Shia militia, Saraya al Salam, vetted new arrivals to the protests on Sunday, in another sign of the deference of Iraqi institutions to religious authority. Earlier on Sunday, Abadi ordered authorities to arrest and prosecute the protesters who had attacked security forces and lawmakers and damaged state property after breaking into the green zone. No arrests were reported. Demonstrators gathered near sites that had remained off-limits to most Iraqis for the past 13 years, insisting they would not leave until the political torpor that has crippled the country and widespread corruption that has whittled its finances is somehow resolved. After ransacking parts of the parliament on Saturday and attacking the cars of some fleeing MPs, protests were orderly on Sunday. Security forces cordoned off some areas leading to official palaces, military headquarters, UN bases, and embassies, with protest leaders insisting that earlier vandalism would not be repeated. Abadi’s latest attempt to introduce changes, which centre on replacing his largely corrupt cabinet with technocrats tasked with guiding the country out of myriad crises, ended in chaos last week – the third time his authority had been defied by the legislature. Iraq is plagued by endemic corruption, the effects of which have come into sharp focus as oil revenues plummet due to structural changes in global oil prices that have slashed budget revenues by up to 70 %. Political decision-making has also been paralysed by incessant power struggles that take precedence over governance and have left many Iraqis convinced official institutions serve only the country’s elite. Demonstrators who gathered near crossed swords that bookended a Saddam-era parade ground chanted against the Iranian military leader, Gen Qassem Suleimani, who wields huge power in Baghdad, and is a rival power base to Abadi. After 24 hours inside an area he was unable to visit even during the rule of the ousted dictator, demonstrator Ahmed Moussawi, 29, said he was now convinced that Iraq’s leaders were pampered and unaccountable. “I tell you, I saw a power station, which gives them 24 hours electricity. I saw more new cars than you could dream about, villas and palaces, open roads. It’s a dream in here,” he said, referring to the green zone. Others spoke of a “stepping through the looking-glass experience”. “Compared to Sadr City, this is a paradise,” said Ali al-Ali, a resident of a sprawling impoverished area in Baghdad’s north. “So this is where they count all the money? They need those big GMCs [four-wheel drive vehicles] to carry it all away.” Officials who remained in the green zone were in lockdown on Sunday. Many MPs fled to Baghdad airport on Saturday night, where they took flights to the Kurdish north and Basra. Embassies remained fully staffed, but the UK and US governments said they were monitoring developments carefully. A western resident of the green zone said the mood on the streets was non- threatening. “I had to come to the UN compound and saw more people who seemed to have just arrived and [were] headed to the interior. Everyone seemed really calm. Some of the security forces were sitting on the grassy areas and some were resting.” But a senior aide to one of Iraq’s leaders said: “The situation is very dangerous right now. Sadr is trying to push his own cabinet, which he claims to be independent to take over the majority of the ministries. But we all know that there isn’t anyone who is independent in Iraq. “Iraqis have to give loyalty to someone or a group and of course it will be the same group who in turn support them and give them power. “Sadr and Maliki [Iraq’s former prime minister Nouri al-Maliki] are both instigating the problem and each one is playing the independent card, but they are both fighting for power. Each wants to prove his loyalty to the public. I can say that there will be a need to form an emergency government.” Baghdad-based political analyst Ihsan Al-Shimari said: “This actually shows that Baghdad has fallen again. The protesters lost their rights when they invaded the parliament and attacked the MPs. Many MPs were attacked, except those loyal to Sadr. “Most of the political parties aren’t nationalists and no one is looking for the country’s interest. The Iraqi street is now split between agreeing on the protests and being against it. Some consider Abadi’s position as weak but I think he tried to deal with the situation wisely. If there are any more incidents with the protesters then this will bring the violence to a different level.” Earlier on Sunday, car bombs in the southern Iraqi city of Samawah killed 31 people and wounded dozens, the latest in a series of large attacks claimed by Islamic State as the country grapples with the worsening political crisis.",REAL
Malia Obama to attend Harvard in 2017 after gap year,"Barack Obama’s daughter Malia will take a year off after high school and attend Harvard University in 2017, the White House announced on Sunday. The 17-year-old is a senior at the elite Sidwell Friends School, in Washington, the same high school where the children and grandchildren of the Clintons, Roosevelts, Bidens and Gores have attended. Malia Obama graduates in June and will celebrate her 18th birthday on the Fourth of July. The president recently said he declined an invitation to speak at the graduation ceremony. “I’m going to be wearing dark glasses, sobbing,” he told talk show host Ellen DeGeneres earlier this year. “I’m going to cry.” Malia visited at least a dozen public and private colleges during her search, including Princeton and Columbia, where her parents earned undergraduate degrees. Harvard encourages new admissions to take a gap year before or during their undergraduate years, so that the students can pursue work experience outside school. For the school’s most famous new freshman, the year off could mean less attention when she does start classes in 2017, and time to build her resume. First lady Michelle Obama has said that Malia hopes to become a film-maker, and that she worked last summer in New York as an intern on the set of the HBO show Girls. She spent the previous summer as a production assistant for CBS, and held previous internships at the National Zoo in Washington. Harvard accepted 5.2% of applicants this year, the lowest acceptance rate in its history. The school has been home to a long list of American leaders and their children: children of Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the Kennedys attended the school, and five of the eight sitting supreme court justices studied at its law school. Obama has said he intends to stay in Washington after he leaves the White House until his youngest daughter, Sasha, graduates from high school in 2019. Even so, the first family has remained quiet about their plans after inauguration day on 20 January 2017, when someone else takes to the Oval Office. “We haven’t figured that out yet,” he told voters in Wisconsin earlier this year. “We’re going to have to stay a couple of years so Sasha can finish.” Though usually extremely private, the president opened up to DeGeneres about his close relationship with his daughter. “I’m not ready for her to leave,”he said. “She’s one of my best friends. It’s going to be hard for me not to have her around all the time, but she’s ready to go. She’s just a really smart, capable person and she’s ready to make her own way.” The Obamas have announced that his presidential library will be built on the south side of Chicago, where he lived and worked before seeking public office.",REAL
Liz Kendall challenges Priti Patel to EU debate at their old school,"Labour MP Liz Kendall, of the remain camp for the forthcoming EU referendum, has challenged minister and leave campaigner Priti Patel, a fellow former pupil of Watford grammar school for girls, to debate the EU vote at their old school in front of the current generation of students. “I hope you will accept this challenge, and make sure the most important question facing our country is debated by Watford girls, not just Bullingdon boys,” said Kendall, MP for Leicester West, in a letter to Patel, referring to the trio of David Cameron, George Osborne and Boris Johnson, all former members of the University of Oxford’s best-known student drinking club. Kendall, who was among those who lost to Jeremy Corbyn in last year’s party leadership election, said: “More than anyone, it is Britain’s young people who will be affected by the decision we take on June 23. It is their jobs and their future that will be on the ballot paper. “I want to make sure that young women’s views are heard loud and clear in a debate that has so far been dominated by men.” Both women are 44 and attended the school in the 80s, by which time it was non-selective. Kendall says she has yet to get a reply, and the Guardian was not able to contact Patel on Sunday.",REAL
Newborn baby among dead after shipwrecks in Mediterranean,"A newborn baby is among 99 people believed to have drowned in two separate shipwrecks off the Libyan coast this weekend, according to survivors who arrived in Italy. Twenty-six survivors were rescued by a commercial vessel after a rubber dinghy in which they were travelling sank in the Mediterranean on Friday, a few hours after departing from Sabratha in Libya. They were transferred to Italian coastguard ships before being brought ashore in Lampedusa, Italy’s southernmost island, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The baby was among 84 people still missing on Saturday.. “The dinghy was taking on water, in very bad conditions. Many people had already fallen in the sea and drowned,” said Flavio Di Giacomo, IOM spokesman in Italy. “They are all very shocked,” Di Giacomo said, adding they would receive psychological support in Lampedusa. The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said that after taking on water the boat broke into two pieces and 26 people were saved from the sea. Survivors from a second shipwreck arrived in the Sicilian port of Pozzallo on Sunday, after an accident during a search-and-rescue operation the day before. Two bodies were recovered and brought ashore along with eight of about 105 people saved, who were taken to hospital in serious condition. The shipwrecks are the latest incidents in which hundreds of people have lost their lives in the Mediterranean. Last week, up to 500 people were feared dead after a shipping boat hoping to reach Italy from eastern Libya sank. Forty-one survivors told UNHCR that smugglers had taken them out to sea and tried to move them to a larger, overcrowded boat that then capsized. So far this year, at least 1,360 people have been reported dead or missing after trying to cross the Mediterranean, including the latest two shipwrecks, while more than 182,800 have reached European shores. Whereas previous years have seen Syrians and Eritreans arriving in large numbers from Libya, most of those reaching Italy this year have been from African nations. In Greece, Syrians have made up nearly half of arrivals, followed by Afghans and Iraqis. Although the majority of people have arrived in Greece in recent months, a controversial EU-Turkey deal to stop refugees and migrants crossing the Aegean Sea has prompted speculation that people could arrive in Italy in greater numbers. However, there is yet to be a significant change in numbers crossing from Libya compared with last year – just over 27,000 people have reached Italy during 2016.",REAL
Freight train leaks hazardous material after derailing near Washington DC,"A freight train derailed close to Washington DC early Sunday and is leaking hazardous material and causing disruption in the area of the capital. More than 10 cars are understood to have left the tracks, a small portion of the long, 175-car southbound train. No injuries have been reported. At least three cars are leaking a hazardous substance, according to Doug Buchanan, a spokesman for the District of Columbia fire department. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a news conference that the leak was contained, but officials were not sure how much had leaked. “The fumes should not cause you any problems and you should not be able to smell them anywhere else,” said DC Fire and EMS Deputy Chief John Donnelly. It was not immediately clear what caused the derailment. Crews were inspecting the tracks, which are used by CSX, Metro and Amtrak, and were working to restore service. Photos tweeted by DC Fire and Emergency after the derailment showed cars in a zigzag line across the tracks. Chris Nellum said he lives nearby and his window looks directly over the tracks. The train derailed near the Rhode Island Avenue metro station shortly before 7am local time and the nearby avenue was closed to road traffic. A witness told local radio station WTOP that he heard “this fantastic noise” outside his home on Sunday morning and rushed to the window, from where he could see the railroad tracks. “I thought it was an airplane too close to the building. Then I looked out and I said, ‘Wow, the train turned over,’” said the local resident. Buchanan said there were no evacuations of residents. “It looks like our guys have got this pretty well contained. Two, possibly three, of the derailed cars are leaking hazardous material. Exactly what that is and the extent of the leak remains unclear,” he said. At least one of the chemicals leaking from the damaged train is understood to be sodium hydroxide, according to the local NBC TV station, citing multiple sources at the scene. Also known as lye and caustic soda, the odorless chemical may generate substantial heat when dissolved in water, which may be sufficient to ignite combustible materials, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The CDC said it could cause eye and skin irritation and burns when exposed. It is also damaging to the respiratory system if the fumes are inhaled. Pictures posted on the fire department’s Twitter account showed several cars lying on their sides by the tracks on the main train route into the city, including tank cars, bulk material cars and box cars. Authorities have not issued official instructions to local residents, but one near the scene told a local television station that he had been instructed to stay inside by firefighters. Resident Chris Nellum said he lived nearby and his window looked directly over the tracks. “I thought it was like a semi-truck coming toward the building, and when I looked out the window, I saw cars piling up,” said Nellum, who had just moved in the night before. “So I’m not even used to hearing trains. It was jarring.” Nellum said his girlfriend tried to leave the area and was told to stay put, but she eventually found a way out. “She’s an environmentalist, so she is very concerned about whatever is leaking,” he said. The CSX train is owned by CSX Transportation, the international freight company based in Jacksonville, Florida. The company put out a statement later on Sunday morning to say that the service was heading towards Hamlet, North Carolina, from Cumberland, Maryland, when the derailment happened. The train was just under half empty, with 94 of the 175 cars loaded with freight. A portion of the Washington DC metro service on the Red line has been suspended in the area with bus shuttles acting as a replacement for passenger train services. An underground gas line was also ruptured during the derailment and gas supplies have been turned off in the area, although it is unclear how many people are affected by the closure, according to the local NBC station.

Leaked TTIP documents cast doubt on EU-US trade deal,"Talks for a free trade deal between Europe and the US face a serious impasse with “irreconcilable” differences in some areas, according to leaked negotiating texts. The two sides are also at odds over US demands that would require the EU to break promises it has made on environmental protection. President Obama said last week he was confident a deal could be reached. But the leaked negotiating drafts and internal positions, which were obtained by Greenpeace and seen by the Guardian, paint a very different picture. “Discussions on cosmetics remain very difficult and the scope of common objectives fairly limited,” says one internal note by EU trade negotiators. Because of a European ban on animal testing, “the EU and US approaches remain irreconcilable and EU market access problems will therefore remain,” the note says. Talks on engineering were also “characterised by continuous reluctance on the part of the US to engage in this sector,” the confidential briefing says. These problems are not mentioned in a separate report on the state of the talks, also leaked, which the European commission has prepared for scrutiny by the European parliament. These outline the positions exchanged between EU and US negotiators between the 12th and the 13th round of TTIP talks, which took place in New York last week. The public document offers a robust defence of the EU’s right to regulate and create a court-like system for disputes, unlike the internal note, which does not mention them. Jorgo Riss, the director of Greenpeace EU, said: “These leaked documents give us an unparalleled look at the scope of US demands to lower or circumvent EU protections for environment and public health as part of TTIP. The EU position is very bad, and the US position is terrible. The prospect of a TTIP compromising within that range is an awful one. The way is being cleared for a race to the bottom in environmental, consumer protection and public health standards.” US proposals include an obligation on the EU to inform its industries of any planned regulations in advance, and to allow them the same input into EU regulatory processes as European firms. American firms could influence the content of EU laws at several points along the regulatory line, including through a plethora of proposed technical working groups and committees. “Before the EU could even pass a regulation, it would have to go through a gruelling impact assessment process in which the bloc would have to show interested US parties that no voluntary measures, or less exacting regulatory ones, were possible,” Riss said. The US is also proposing new articles on “science and risk” to give firms greater regulatory say. Disputes over pesticides residues and food safety would be dealt with by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation’s Codex Alimentarius system. Environmentalists say the body has loose rules on corporate influence, allowing employees of companies such as BASF, Nestle and Coca Cola to sit on – and sometimes lead – national delegations. Some 44% of its decisions on pesticides residues have been less stringent than EU ones, with 40% of rough equivalence and 16% being more demanding, according to Greenpeace. GM foods could also find a widening window into Europe, with the US pushing for a working group to adopt a “low level presence initiative”. This would allow the import of cargo containing traces of unauthorised GM strains. The EU currently blocks these because of food safety and cross-pollination concerns. The EU has not yet accepted the US demands, but they are uncontested in the negotiators’ note, and no counter-proposals have been made in these areas. In January, the EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström said [pdf] the precautionary principle, obliging regulatory caution where there is scientific doubt, was a core and non-negotiable EU principle. She said: “We will defend the precautionary approach to regulation in Europe, in TTIP and in all our other agreements.” But the principle is not mentioned in the 248 pages of TTIP negotiating texts. The European commission has also promised to safeguard environmental laws, defend international standards and protect the EU’s right to set high green benchmarks in future. But the new leak will not placate critics of the deal, who have pointed to attempts by fossil fuel firms and others to influence its outcome, as a sign of things to come. The EU negotiators internal note says “the US expressed that it would have to consult with its chemical industry on how to position itself” on issues of market access for non-agricultural goods. Where industry lobbying in regulatory processes is concerned, the US also “insisted” that the EU be “required” to involve US experts in its development of electrotechnical standards.",REAL
Zac Goldsmith's mayoral campaign tactics upset Sayeeda Warsi,"The former Tory Foreign Office minister Sayeeda Warsi has expressed exasperation at Zac Goldsmith’s increasingly strident tone as he seeks to make up ground before Thursday’s vote for London mayor. Goldsmith, who is as much as 20 percentage points behind Labour’s Sadiq Khan, again sought to tar his rival with the brush of extremism in a piece in the Mail on Sunday. The comment piece was illustrated with a picture of the bus destroyed by a suicide bomber in the 2005 terrorist attacks in London. Lady Warsi, who resigned from the government in protest against its policy on Gaza, tweeted her disappointment, if not at Goldsmith himself then at his campaign’s scare tactics. In his comment piece, Goldsmith wrote: “The number one job of any mayor of London is to keep our city safe. Yet if Labour wins on Thursday, we will have handed control of the Met, and with it control over national counter-terrorism policy, to a party whose candidate and current leadership have, whether intentionally or not, repeatedly legitimised those with extremist views.” Apart from attempts to portray his rival as soft on extremists, the Goldsmith campaign has been criticised for using divisive tactics by specifically targeting minority ethnic voters with a warning that a vote for Khan would put their family heirlooms at risk. Goldsmith’s attempt to court the Indian vote took a farcical turn, however, when when the self-proclaimed Bollywood enthusiast could not name a single Bollywood film or actor while being questioned on camera. “Let me think … No I’m not going to give you one. I can’t think of a favourite,” he said. “I can’t think of a favourite. I love almost everything about Bollywood. I love the atmosphere, the colour and I love the excitement. I want as much Bollywood as possible here in London as possible.” Although the frontrunner, Khan has acknowledged that the antisemitism row engulfing his party after the suspension of Naz Shah, the Bradford West MP, and the remarks by the former London mayor, Ken Livingstone, on Hitler and zionism, could harm his chance of becoming the first Muslim to occupy the post. In an interview with the Observer, Khan, the son of a bus driver, said he would not be thrown off course by the controversy, but conceded there could be electoral fallout that would damage him and his party. “I accept that the comments that Ken Livingstone has made make it more difficult for Londoners of Jewish faith to feel that the Labour party is a place for them, and so I will carry on doing what I have always been doing, which is to speak for everyone. If I should have the privilege to be the mayor I will show Londoners the sort of mayor I can be.”",REAL
Helicopter had to return to base twice in days before Norway crash,"A helicopter that crashed in Norway, killing 13 people including a Briton, had to return to base twice in the days before the incident owing to a warning light. The Super Puma had to turn back to Bergen airport, Flesland, last Tuesday when the pilot spotted the indication light, the operator CHC Helicopter confirmed on Sunday. An aircraft part was replaced and a test flight was conducted the following day. But that flight was also aborted and another component changed when the warning light reappeared. CHC said the aircraft went on to complete six commercial flights with no indications of problems on Thursday, the day before the fatal crash. The helicopter was carrying two crew and 11 passengers from the Gullfaks B oil field, about 74 miles (120km) off the Norwegian coast, when it crashed into the rocky shoreline of Turøy, a tiny island near Bergen. Norwegian television showed footage of what appeared to be a helicopter rotor blade spiralling down minutes before the crash. A witness, Rebecca Andersen, told the newspaper Verdens Gang that the“rotor blades came rushing toward us … Then we heard a violent explosion.” The 41-year-old British man killed in the crash was named as Iain Stuart, from Laurencekirk in Aberdeenshire. He worked for oilfield services company Halliburton. A statement released by relatives of the 41-year-old said: “We as a family are devastated at the loss of Iain in Friday’s tragic helicopter crash in Norway. “Iain was a loving husband and devoted father to his two children and as a family we are heartbroken. He was a caring son, brother, uncle and friend to many. “We are appreciative of all the messages of support and kind thoughts. “We now ask, as a family, that we are allowed some privacy at this difficult and sad time to grieve and come to terms with our loss.” A statement from CHC, issued to the Press Association, said: “It is correct that the helicopter returned to base on Tuesday 26 April. The pilot had a warning light and returned to Flesland according to procedure. “At Flesland the helicopter was inspected, according to procedure, and a part was replaced. “Wednesday, the helicopter was taken on a test flight, where the warning light reappeared, the helicopter returned to base, changed another component, the next test drive was completed without any warning light. “Thursday, the aircraft completed six commercial flights, all without any indication of problems. None of the changed parts were physically connected to rotor or gearbox.” The statement added: “These returns to base are essential for flight safety and part of operating in a highly regulated industry. Sometimes an RTB can be for technical issues, other times it is much more mundane. “At all times, CHC has met or exceeded the requirements of our regulatory authorities and our customers, and continues to offer a compliant service. “Speculation about the cause of the accident is unhelpful and we must also be careful to respect the feelings of the families who perished in the tragic events of Bergen.” Tributes have been paid to Stuart, who was a member of Brechin golf club, where a flag flew at half mast on Saturday. Stephen Rennie, the resident golf professional and manager, told the Mail on Sunday: “The whole club is shocked and saddened to hear the devastating news about Iain. He was a very popular member of the club and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time.” A family friend, Charles Aitken, 75, said: “My daughter knows his wife, Amy. They are a really lovely family – it’s an absolute tragedy.” In tributes posted on social media, Stuart was described as “always a gent” and “a top bloke”. Field operators Statoil said the pilots of the helicopter – a Norwegian and an Italian – were CHC Helicopter staff. Ten of the passengers were Norwegian nationals and were employed by companies including Schlumberger, Aker Solutions, and Statoil. Their names have not yet been released. Emergency crews pulled the wrecked fuselage out of the sea on Saturday. A team from the UK’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch has gone to the site. On Saturday, the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, tweeted about the “horrifying reports” and sthat she was being kept informed about the rescue work. She said her thoughts went out to all those who had lost a loved one. All UK commercial passenger flights using the same Airbus EC225LP Super Puma model have been grounded by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), mirroring action taken by its Norwegian counterpart. BP and Statoil have also suspended the use of the aircraft model after the accident, so it is unable to carry oil and gas workers, the BBC reported. EC225 Super Puma helicopters were previously grounded for a period in the UK after two crashes in Scotland in 2012. Both incidents, in which all passengers and crew were rescued, were blamed on gearbox problems. More than 6,500 people have now signed an online petition calling on the CAA to permanently remove the EC225 from service. They include Audrey Wood, who lost her son Stuart when a helicopter carrying workers from a BP oil platform crashed off Peterhead in Aberdeenshire in April 2009.",REAL
Heseltine: Brexit Tory MPs turning on policies that got them elected,"Michael Heseltine, a former deputy prime minister, has claimed Conservative ministers and MPs campaigning to leave the EU are “turning on the policies” that got them elected in 2015. Pointing to similarities between the infighting under John Major in the 1990s and the party’s split before the 23 June referendum, the Tory peer said he found the actions of Brexit campaigners within the party “mind-blowing”. Lord Heseltine’s remarks came as Conservatives on both sides of the debate insisted there was no imminent threat to David Cameron’s leadership if the vote went against the remain camp. However, the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, predicted Cameron would have to quit, echoing Kenneth Clarke, a pro-Europe former cabinet minister, who made the same warning last month. Heseltine’s intervention came as an Opinium/Observer opinion poll on voting intentions suggested an extremely close result. Appearing on the Murnaghan show on Sky News on Sunday, Heseltine said: “I know that this government is in power because David Cameron is more popular than the Conservative party. I don’t like saying that particularly because I don’t want to have a personality cult. “But I know that the facts are that he won this election for the Conservatives and now to see people who, frankly, many of them would not have their seats and certainly many of them wouldn’t be in government if David Cameron hadn’t won that election for the Conservatives, to see them now turning on the policies that some of them have been sitting in the government implementing I just find mind-blowing.” Farage, meanwhile, told The Andrew Marr Show on the BBC that if voters chose to leave the EU “we have to make sure that a British government carries out the will of the people”. He said: “I have seen referendums all over Europe where the people’s voice has been ignored. “So Ukip being strong and making sure that the government and the prime minister – which won’t be David Cameron in my view, but whoever it is – making sure they do go for article 50 of the [EU] treaty and start the process of political divorce.” Former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles, who is pro-EU, and George Eustice, the food and farming minister who wants the UK to leave, told Pienaar’s Politics on BBC’s Radio 5 Live that there was no imminent threat to Cameron if the vote went against EU membership. Pickles said: “I think David Cameron is a fantastic prime minister. I want him to stay on as long as he wishes to do, and no I don’t think he’d have to resign.” He said it would take an enormous effort for the party to get opposing sides working together” again but was confident this would happen. Pickles said he would be “first to extend the hand of friendship” to those who wanted to leave. Asked whether Cameron would have to find senior government posts for prominent out campaigners such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson if voters chose to remain in the EU, Pickles replied: “I certainly feel that both Boris and Michael are people of enormous talent and I hope that they have senior positions in the cabinet, but I would not be so presumptuous as to name a particular post.” Pickles insisted he would not watch a pre-referendum live TV debate between Cameron and Iain Duncan-Smith, a prominent leave campaigner, who quit the cabinet in March over benefit cuts. “I think I would probably be watching a box set of Game of Thrones while that is on,” he said. Eustice said Conservative MPs on both sides would reconcile themselves to whatever decision emerged from the referendum. He added: “The parliamentary party will get back together, heal itself. The truth is David Cameron has already made clear he doesn’t intend to fight another election. He has made it clear he is going to stand down before the general election. I don’t think anyone is going to be in any rush to move against him, whatever the outcome would be.” The parliamentary party was very different from that of the 90s, Eustice said, adding: “If it is a vote to leave, he is going to need people like me to try to help him negotiate those terms for leaving. If it is a vote to stay, I will help him put the party back together. I have been very clear about that, and so have all the other ministers who are campaigning … to leave.”",REAL
Truth or fiction? John McAfee for the Libertarian party's presidential nominee,"The New York state Libertarian party convention was held in New York City on Saturday. It started at 10am. It grew lively at noon, the hour John McAfee showed up. The anti-virus software mogul and one-time international fugitive had turned into a presidential hopeful, and he arrived at the convention dressed like an ageing rocker: blond streaks in his hair, aviator sunglasses hooked into the neck of his white T-shirt and a flamboyant paisley scarf draped around his neck. McAfee, who infamously went on the run from Belize police in 2012 after being named as a “person of interest” in a murder case, would later tell the Guardian he never went out at night for fear that the government of Belize might try to “whack” him. That threat aside, the 70-year-old seemed to be enjoying himself as he overshadowed the rest of Libertarian party nominees at the convention in the East Village. He was in the city to debate his fellow hopefuls, including the party’s 2012 candidate, Gary Johnson. Johnson achieved the party’s best-ever election result last time round, winning 1.2m votes – 0.99% of the vote nationally. He’s a popular man. But there was no doubting who was the star on Saturday. Rather than immediately enter the convention – held in the back room of the restaurant – McAfee posted up outside, having his photograph taken with Libertarians and passersby, smoking cigarettes and acting up for the four-person film crew he had arrived with. He is being filmed for a series on Spy TV, and he seemed to be enjoying the attention. He chatted into the camera, he laughed into the camera, he came up close to the lens and stuck his tongue out at the camera. It was all well and good until the camerawoman misjudged one of McAfee’s playful lunges and smacked him in the mouth with the camera lens. The 70-year-old checked his teeth in the window of a nearby swimwear store. No permanent damage. McAfee was best known for his eponymous software until 2012, when he went on the run from Belize. Police had wanted to question him in relation to the death of a neighbor, but were never able to, as McAfee made it back to the US. Four years after the incident, even in the middle of a presidential campaign, he is adamant that there is a constant threat to his life. “The government of Belize I shamed, I humiliated, I cost them a ton of money in terms of tourist travel,” he said. “They want me to shut the fuck up about this, which I will not do and I have not. So if you think a corrupt government run by the Sinaloa cartel is not willing to whack an American citizen, then you need to bone up on the Sinaloa cartel.” McAfee said he did not feel under threat during the conversation – “it’s daytime; there’s a lot of people around. No one’s going to do anything” – but said he never felt safe. “I don’t go out at night,” he said. “Ever. Anywhere.” McAfee argued that he should be president because only he has the skills to address the problem of internet security. He referred to “the imminent collapse of our nation due to the fact that we are 20 years behind much of the rest of the world in cybersecurity.” “I will win,” McAfee added. “I would win the general election. Because I know who I am, I know my talents, and I know what my limits are. And I’ve been around long enough to know people’s minds.” McAfee began his debate performance with an unorthodox opening statement: “I don’t have a statement prepared.” “I am unprepared for everything, always,” he added, “so I’m not going to waste your time.” He sat back down. He had used 30 seconds of his allotted two minutes. The others had prepared. Johnson, a two-term governor of New Mexico and seemingly the best qualified to be the 2016 nominee, set out his plan for what the Libertarian party needed to do to move beyond the role of quirky outsider: join presidential debates. “If you’re not in the presidential debates, you’re not going to win. It’s not going to happen,” Johnson told the Guardian. In 2000, the commission on presidential debates decided that a party or candidate would only be allowed to participate if they received 15% support or more across five national polls. Johnson and the Libertarian party have only crossed that threshold in one poll so far. “A month ago, I was in my first and only national poll, and I was at 11% against Trump and Clinton,” Johnson said. “If my name were in the polls, given the polarizing nature of this race, I will be at 15%, which will get me into the debates.” To that end, he has pressed polling firms to include him in more surveys. He has also filed a lawsuit, along with the Green party, against the commission on presidential debates. Johnson also expressed, with frustration, his belief that “most people” are libertarian but just don’t know it. During the debate and in conversation, he repeatedly referred to the website isidewith.com, which asks users to take a quiz to find out which presidential candidates they are most aligned with. “If everybody would take that quiz [to] find out who you align with, I think most people will be libertarian,” he said. “It’s the best sales tool I can think of, and what I tell people is: ‘Take the quiz’.” Johnson has taken the quiz. “Outside of the other Libertarians running for president, the next presidential candidate that I most align with is Bernie Sanders, at 73% [aligned]. Which I found to be really revealing. “On the social side, marriage equality, marijuana legalization, crony capitalism, military interventions, we’re on the same page.” After the debate, Johnson and others hung around to chat and shake hands. But McAfee had had enough. He jumped up and marched out, his film crew scurrying behind him. He seemed to have lost some of his rock star pizzazz. “I’m 70 years old, and I’ve been talking all day.” Asked what he thought of the debate, he said: “It was boring, as all debates are, and utter nonsense. He said he planned “to rest as much as possible” before the party’s national convention at the end of May in Orlando, Florida. Then he returned to his hotel, camera crew in tow, presumably not to emerge until the next break of day.",REAL
The innovators: desalination unit brings clean water on wheels,"Travelling around Thailand in the 1990s, William Janssen was impressed with the basic rooftop solar heating systems that were on many homes, where energy from the sun was absorbed by a plate and then used to heat water for the home. Two decades later and Janssen has developed that basic idea he saw in south-east Asia into a portable device that uses the power from the sun to purify water. The “Desolenator” operates as a mobile desalination unit that can take water from the sea, rivers and boreholes – as well as rain – and clean it for human consumption. The device, which looks like a thick solar photovoltaic panel on wheels, is aimed at a wide range of users – from homeowners in the developing world who do not have a constant supply of water to people living off the grid in rural parts of the US. Janssen saw that there was a need for a sustainable way to clean water in both the developing and the developed countries when he moved to the United Arab Emirates and saw large-scale water processing. “I was confronted with the enormous carbon footprint that the Gulf nations have because of all of the desalination that they do ,” he said. The Desolenator, which measures 120cm by 90cm, is a solar panel that converts sunlight into electricity, but also uses the heat that is generated from the sun as part of the process. In operation, water flows over the panel and soaks up the heat to bring it to a high temperature. It then flows into a small boiler in the device, which is powered by the electricity produced from the solar panel, and converted to steam. The steam is then converted back into cleaned water via a tube that changes the temperature again, while the waste flows out of the machine. Boiling the water gets rid of pollutants, said Janssen, such as arsenic and fluoride. “The device has a particle filter, a very simple filter which you can just shake empty, and the device is ready to deal with water which is slightly cloudy or slightly murky. It just flows through,” he said. There are two tubes for liquid coming out – one for the brine waste and another for the distilled water. The water flows constantly through the device during the cleaning process – one litre flows through a number of times – and small volumes of water are distilled through boiling and heat exchange. It can produce 15 litres of distilled water in a day, which Janssen said is enough to sustain a family for cooking and drinking. An analysis released earlier this year found at least two-thirds of the world’s population live with severe water scarcity for at least a month every year. Janssen said that by 2030, half of the world’s population will be living with water stress – where the demand exceeds the supply over a certain period of time. “It is really important that a sustainable solution is brought to the market that is able to help these people and make sure there is an independence for themselves to be protected from this crisis,” he said. “If you go to places like Somalia, Yemen or Bangladesh, it is an immense problem because these people don’t have the money for desalination plants, which are very expensive to build. They don’t have the money to operate them, they are very maintenance intensive and they don’t have the money to buy the diesel to run the desalination plants so it is really bad situation.” The first commercial versions of the Desolenator are expected to be in operation in India early next year, after field tests are carried out. The market for the self-sufficient devices in developing countries is twofold – those who cannot afford the money for the device outright and pay through microfinance or by use, and middle income homes who can lease their own equipment. “People in India don’t pay for a fridge outright, they pay for it over six months. They would put the Desolenator on their roof and hook it up to their municipal supply and they would get very get very reliable drinking water on a daily basis,” he said. In the developed world, it is aimed at niche markets where tap water is unavailable – for camping, on boats, for the military or even for survivalists preparing for a doomsday scenario. Prices will vary on where it is bought. In the developing world, the price will depend on what deal aid organisations can negotiate. In developed countries, it is likely to come in at $1,000 (£685) a unit, said Janssen. “We are a venture with a social mission. We are aware that the product we have envisioned is mainly finding application in the developing and humanitarian world and that this the way we will proceed. We do realise that to be a viable company there is a bottom line to keep in mind,” he said. The company itself is based at Imperial College London although Janssen, its chief executive, still lives in the UAE. It has so far raised £340,000 in funding. Within two years, he said, the company aims to be selling 1,000 units a month, mainly in the humanitarian field. They are expected to be sold in areas such as Australia, northern Chile, Peru, Texas and California. • You can read our archive of The Innovators columns on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",REAL
London mayoral race: Zac Goldsmith wins backing of Polish prince,"Zac Goldsmith has secured the backing of a fringe rival in the London mayoral race by pledging to support priority funding for Saturday schools for the children of London’s Polish community. John Zylinski is expected to endorse Goldsmith for the election on Thursday at a Trafalgar Square rally on Monday. Although Zylinski is a marginal figure in the race, his support for the Tory MP is likely to help him as he he attempts to win over an estimated 100,000 Polish voters in the capital. While critical of the Tory and Labour frontrunners in the race, Zylinski had been particularly scathing of Goldsmith, who he said had “no real achievements in life apart from inheriting £300m and running an ecology magazine”. But Zylinski, a prince whose family were uprooted by the communist government and fled to Britain during the second world war, said he was urging Polish voters in London to give their second preference vote to Goldsmith. Zylinski, who last year challenged Ukip leader Nigel Farage to a sword duel, has released a statement from Goldsmith’s campaign director, Mark Fullbrook, supporting calls for a memorial to commemorate Polish pilots who fought in the Battle of Britain, as well as the Saturday school funding. It added: “[Goldsmith] is also aware of the importance to the Polish community that Saturday schools play and will use his powers as London mayor to secure more funding to these so that Polish children across London can continue to learn about their country’s language, culture and history.” Goldsmith’s campaign has been focusing on targeting various London communities, often with specifically tailored mailshots, although he rejected accusations that he has engaged in “dog-whistle politics” against his Labour opponent Sadiq Khan by seeking to link him with extremism and Labour’s anti-semitism row.",REAL
The golden age of investing is over: get used to Wall Street's 'new normal',"It’s a question that has haunted the minds of high-flying financiers, self-help authors and regular Americans for decades: what’s the best way to make money investing? In the past, the best way, hands down, was to have won the genetic lot: to have been born so that your peak earning and investing years coincided with a bull market. If you came of age in the early 1980s and started investing, you’ve already won the game. Those years saw an extraordinary bull market in the bond market, and the three decades since included what became a golden age for stock market investors. Sure, the stock market’s path was a bumpy one, with downturns, mini-crashes and other more serious bursts, like of the dotcom bubble in 2000. Overall, however, returns greatly exceeded historical averages, and recessions cleared the way for the market to climb to greater heights. Consulting company McKinsey is now warning us that the factors that contributed to those golden age returns don’t exist any more. But the era lasted long enough to make Americans think of it as normal, and to leave us wondering about what feels like an “abnormal” environment of volatile markets and mediocre returns. That, the McKinsey analysts argue in a new report making waves throughout the investment world, is precisely the wrong way to look at the whole matter. It was those abnormally high returns that were unusual, they point out. Now we’re heading into a period of compressed or collapsing investment returns, and we’ll need to adjust all our expectations and behavior accordingly. The McKinsey study attributes the exceptional returns to four unusual factors. A sharp decline in US inflation rates, to well below their historic average, led to a rise in the price that investors were willing to pay for every dollar of corporate earnings, or the much-discussed price/earnings ratio. A steep drop in interest rates boosted returns from bonds and also helped buoy stock prices. While global GDP growth was normal during the golden era, the researchers found that demographics in emerging markets and improving productivity worldwide boosted corporate profits and revenues, and contributed to stock market returns. Then there’s the unprecedented surge in corporate profits in the last three decades: US companies never had it so good. These factors are gone. It’s time to brace for a period in which investment returns could be lower than long-term averages. Between 1985 and 2014, the US stock market delivered returns of 7.9%, on average, every year; the bond market rewarded investors with an average annual return of 5%. Over the next 20 years, look for those figures to shrink to as little as 4% to 5% for stocks (if you’re cautious about the economic outlook), and zero to 0.1% for bonds. If you take a more upbeat view of the economy, you can ratchet the figures up to 5.5% to 6.5% for stocks, and 1% to 2% for stocks. Well, that’s OK, isn’t it? You could put all your money in stocks and ignore bonds – how much difference can a percentage point or two make? You could also put all your eggs in a proverbial basket, and ignore the details. While you’d be right to favor stocks in any asset allocation model (they tend to perform better over the long haul), you also need diversity. As the crisis of 2008 reminded us all, there will be periods when if you don’t have at least part of your portfolio in safer investments, such as bonds, you’ll end up losing capital. A similar look at the long term shows that a single percentage point can make a very, very big difference. Let’s say that you’ve got $100,000 and you’re earning an annual return of 5.5%. At the end of 30 years, assuming you have reinvested all of the money you make, thanks to the magic of compounding, you’ll have about $500,000. But if your returns are only 4.5%, that sum will fall to $375,000. A single percentage point has cost you $125,000 over 30 years. A decline of two percentage points, and you’ve lost nearly half of your total potential returns. McKinsey’s message is that investors need to lower their expectations, work more years and double their savings. While many advisory firms don’t find much to quibble about in McKinsey’s conclusions, some aren’t as willing to tell investors to simply give up. “McKinsey’s take on lower returns is spot on, in our opinion,” says a memo from New Jersey investment advisor RegentAtlantic. But it also argues there are parts of the market – such as the emerging markets, and smaller companies in those markets, in particular – that offer higher returns (and more risk). The report, however, merely articulates handwriting that’s been on the wall for a while. But it does warn that it’s going to be much, much more difficult for any of us to recover from any financial mistakes that we make. The markets aren’t going to give us a helping hand. So when you read lists of financial tips such as starting to contribute to your 401k as soon as you can, don’t see them as suggestions – they’re commandments. If the market isn’t going to help increase the amount you save, you’ll have to do it, making every dollar you put aside more valuable – and the dollars you save in your 20s will always be vastly more valuable than those you invest in your 40s or 50s, thanks to compounding. Just do it. Similarly, watch out for some of the worst financial pitfalls you can make: dipping into that 401k, except in the direst of emergencies; racking up credit card debt and making only minimum payments; buying more houses than you can afford. Even paying for private schools from kindergarten through college, or helping to finance your child’s wedding, can be a mistake if you’re doing it at the expense of funding your own retirement needs. Yes, you are investing in your children’s future (or the future health of the florist or wedding photographer’s businesses), but how will they feel when, in 15 to 20 years’ time, they realize that the price for that financial help is ongoing financial support? In a low-return environment, with investment tailwinds transformed into headwinds, those are some of the tough trade-offs that we’ll have to wrestle with. Like it or not, it’s time to prepare for the “new normal”.",REAL
Meet the '6 Dad': how Norm Kelly became the Drake of Toronto politics,"Norm Kelly was quite excited about Drake’s new album. He had that in common with all of Toronto. Views, released on Friday, is an ode to Drake’s hometown: references abound to local streets and landmarks, city transit gets a shout-out, and the album cover, already widely parodied, finds the rapper perched nonchalantly atop the CN Tower. But Kelly’s affection ran deeper than mere civic pride. The 74-year-old city councillor and former de facto mayor greeted the record like a father in a delivery room. His love wasn’t just fervent. It was paternal. Views arrived at midnight and Norm Kelly ushered it in. On Twitter, where he boasts nearly three hundred thousand followers, Kelly was aglow with praise. “The city is urging those who plan on purchasing #VIEWS to make sure your fire alarm is operational,” he joked in the hours before release. And when it finally dropped, he was succinct about the thrill. He tweeted just two words: “Oh boy.” Toronto picked the exclamation up as if he’d just spoken for the whole city. He was retweeted more than five thousand times. Kelly is a social media phenomenon. It’s not often that city councillors are Twitter stars, but Kelly definitely is one. Indeed, among millennials, he’s thought of as part idol and part meme: they’ve christened him “6 Dad”, derived from Drake’s name for Toronto, “the 6”, which has since become a globally recognized alias for Canada’s largest city. Kelly has been active on Twitter since 2010, but it was only last summer that he attracted so considerable a following. In July, while Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill was engaged in a much-publicized quarrel with Drake, Kelly tweeted a message in supported of the hometown superstar: “You’re no longer welcome in Toronto, @MeekMill.” It would go on to be retweeted 129,675 times – and with that, the otherwise inauspicious @norm went viral. Further barbs, nastier (and funnier) still, continued to hit the Twitter stratosphere. So merciless were Kelly’s attacks that Meek Mill was soon compelled to respond: “Aye white man @norm what gives you the audacity to tell me I can’t come somewhere over voicing my opinion!” the rapper tweeted. It was highly unusual that a popular rapper should have bothered to retaliate against a politician in his mid-70s. Naturally, Kelly – and, of course, his new squad of Drake-loving young fans – took this retort as a compliment. “I innocently strayed on to the rap battlefield,” Kelly said with modesty, seated behind the desk of his City Hall office. “I sent that tweet out there about Meek. That just sparked an enormous amount of interest. With Meek, things turned serious.” Kelly still ribs his rival on occasion, to great effect: a joke he made at the rapper’s expense in January has been retweeted more than 150,000 times. His account generally thrives without confrontation. Interest varies, as you might imagine. A declaration about ginger ale may luck into 6,000 retweets; an advisory about March break activities in Toronto may earn only a few dozen. The breakout successes repeat a familiar theme: rap feuds. In March, Kelly marshalled a Drake reference to trash-talk Donald Trump. Within hours, it had been retweeted 25,000 times. The swagger has proven enormously successful. Kelly is now a full-blown local celebrity: when he goes out, he’s swarmed, cheered, hollered at or excitedly high-fived. Hardly a day passes that an eager Torontonian doesn’t descend upon him, unsheathe an iPhone, and snap a quick selfie. Kelly, the stalwart, septuagenarian politician, has found a new generation of fans, many of whom are too young even to vote. Kelly’s command of contemporary rap vernacular is curiously precise. Impressive too is his fluency in the language of memes: scarcely does he misuse a Gif or hashtag, or deploy a “bae” when he really means “woes”. Young people, meanwhile, have a low tolerance for imposters and a keen eye for spotting the fakes. They’re quick to call out politicians like Hillary Clinton for trying to sound hip, and lately some have been wondering if Kelly has someone else pulling the levers behind the scenes. Kelly slammed Meek Mill when Mill insisted Drake employed a ghostwriter. Now Kelly is often accused of the same. The chief suspect is Jerry Nasr, a special assistant in Kelly’s office. Toronto media tend to refer to Nasr’s presence in the office in a somewhat accusatory way: there are often “rumors” of his involvement with the Twitter account, or suggestions that his purview extends beyond what he claims. “With pictures and stuff,” he told me vaguely, when I asked outright in what way he helped. Kelly elaborated: “One of the things I learned, early on, was that a tweet that uses a visual gets more viewers than just text. I asked Jerry if he could do the time-consuming search for photographs to illustrate what I’m looking for. If he finds something that really intrigues him, he brings it to my attention.” Nasr, too, keeps Kelly “up to date with what’s trending”, but the content, he insists, “is all Norm”. For Kelly, the practice is an expression of his sensibility. “I grew up on Laurel and Hardy, Groucho Marx, Monty Python. To have an outlet for the comic sense I’ve developed over the years really strikes me as something fun.” The strategy has clearly been successful: people adore Norm. But his popularity among millennials is not without complications. Kelly’s high profile has made him the target of a number of vitriolic local editorials – most of which insinuate that time in the spotlight is time he could be doing the mundane work of politics, echoing the problems pundits in the country have had with Justin Trudeau’s winning charm –and has trained on him a high degree of scrutiny. Whatever drawbacks stardom brings, Kelly can be assured of one ally: Drake, the 6 God himself. Not long after his skirmish with Meek Mill, Kelly received word of a social invitation: Drake wanted him to be his guest at OVO Fest, the annual concert he hosts in Toronto. But Kelly couldn’t make it. They were fated to meet again. Last autumn, Kelly was invited by a local university’s student union to attend a free outdoor concert – an invitation extended with ulterior motives. “They told me they had invited Drake,” Kelly remembers. “Signs, as they read them, indicated there was a pretty good chance Drake would be there. They said if I could come and meet him, that would be the cherry on top.” Drake did indeed turn up, and he welcomed Kelly warmly. “We chatted very comfortably,” Kelly says, understandably pleased. (Kelly, of course, had company: “Jerry came and brought his girlfriend.”) Since then, the pair have been friendly. “I saw Drake at a Toronto Raptors game recently,” Kelly tells me. “I approached him to say hello. He sensed me coming. He turned to look at me, and his first words were, ‘6 Dad!’”",REAL
"The joke isn't on Ronald Reagan's illness, but on America for elevating him","It took a little more than 12 hours for Will Ferrell to drop out of a starring role in a satirical film about Ronald Reagan’s struggles with Alzheimer’s – just long enough for conservatives to muster up a bit of outrage with which to knock the comedian into submission, and to raise questions about whether the free speech brigade has become PC. Hadn’t they said self-censorship and worrying about offending people are signs of the apocalypse? Aren’t I a bleeding heart liberal who needs to lighten up? Partisan gaming aside, how far can satire go – is there a line? I’d argue yes, even when it comes to leaders round the world. It’s easy to make fun of politicians, especially presidents. Most have big, honking targets on their backs, or, in the case of Bill Clinton, a massive nose on his face – ready material for cartoonists, journalists and comedy writers. It’s also cathartic for the public to needle our fellow citizens who wield the bloody cudgel of authority. We see our leaders every day, on television, the internet, or the front page of a tabloid – the ubiquity of heads of state is rivaled only by Beyoncé Knowles-Carter, who seems to hold more sway over the average human life than the president of Brazil, impeached or unimpeached. I could probably draw Barack Obama’s face from memory faster than I could my own face (to be fair, I mostly know my face from absolute necessity – it’s unavoidable when I have to take on a pimple or measure the width of my bald spot). Politicians are especially inviting for mockery when you realize that they control our lives and may or may not be unrepentantly corrupt. The image of David Cameron, the British prime minister, defiling a pig knocks him down to our level, or slightly below us – I don’t know many pig defilers at this stage. The moralistic ones are even more tempting. The “Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer” meme is funny only because the man persists in telling everyone else on the planet how to behave, like some kind of beady-eyed Miss Manners. I hate to explain how comedy works, but if he actually murdered anyone, we probably wouldn’t laugh quite as much. Ronald Reagan – actor, governor, president, tearer-downer of walls, breaker of chains, and mother of dragons – certainly opened himself up for mockery during his time in office. The pithy one-liners, the cowboy hats, and the homespun wisdom made him seem less like a human being and more like the generic president from a B-grade disaster movie. It’s as though America elected William Devane or Robert Vaughn to run the country. Why not laugh at a guy like that? But the least funny thing about Reagan was that he had Alzheimer’s. I’m grateful that I’ve never had to watch the disease take hold in a loved one, but few fates sound more terrifying than someone you care about forgetting who you are. Dementia does not strike me as unmined territory of comedy. That said, I think plenty of people on the left want to laugh at Reagan for the same reason conservatives love to verbally abuse Obama: the adoration the other side showers on him can verge on the obnoxious. But liberals are also told, routinely, that Reagan’s resume was unimpeachable. They’re bombarded with talking points from modern politicians, who are desperate to detail the belief system of St Ronnie. Cruz mentions Reagan in his stump speeches so often that you’d think he keeps around a cardboard cutout of the man everywhere he goes, to lay offerings at its feet and fake photos with other believers. I’d be happy to never hear the name Ronald Reagan again outside of a rousing game of Trivial Pursuit: Film Edition. But mocking his disease is akin to trying to make light of Franklin Roosevelt’s polio. He had no control over it, and it devastated those around him. It’s the very definition of punching down, and because I am not an unfeeling monster, I can’t help but sympathize with Reagan’s children, who will never be able to laugh at their father’s condition. Before we knew Reagan had Alzheimer’s, reports of his issues with lucidity were treated as fair game by comedy writers. On Saturday Night Live, Phil Hartman portrayed the 40th US president as a doddering geriatric, prone to falling asleep during briefings, an impression based on the political chatter of the day. His wife, Nancy, had an astrologer offer advice during her time in the White House, which still sounds insane, even during a year when the presumptive Republican nominee for president has appeared at WrestleMania and been on the receiving end of a Stone Cold Stunner. At the time, it probably felt like a relief to to caricature Reagan as a crazy old fool, a man who loved naps more than running a country, who turned a blind eye toward the Aids epidemic, shut down mental hospitals, destroyed trade unions, and generally cratered our economy so badly with supply-side theories that, by the time he left office, the nation was trapped in a crippling recession. His successor took the blame. Those horrible policy decisions are what make Reagan an object for ridicule. As is often the case, the people across from him on the ideological divide feel they can reclaim their dignity through a well-executed joke. It’s why Republicans relish any chance to paint Obama as a pretentious communist from Kenya, and why Democrats never tire of portraying George W Bush as a yokel. Satire is the great equalizer, the last tool available to the helpless masses. Armed rebellions haven’t been popular in this country for a couple of centuries, so a sharp witticism is the next best thing. There’s a reason Donald Trump spent so much time attempting to thwart the efforts of Graydon Carter’s 90s satire magazine, Spy. Two decades later, he’s still saying his hands are normal, beautiful, completely fine. If satire is a valuable tool for the proletariat, then why have limits? Why not attack Reagan? His missteps still haunt the nation, so shouldn’t he have to answer for them? Or should we hold tight to the modicum of decency in all of us? The former president isn’t around to field the criticisms of a movie or an op-ed, but his family is still here to relive whatever agony his deterioration and death brought. The joke is not on Reagan for being sick, or on his children. It’s on us for rubber-stamping his policies, and then elevating him to the level of a deity after he died. Instead of seriously dealing with his legacy, people name airports after him and use him to score political points. No movie is going to change what we’ve done.",REAL
Ken Livingstone muddies history to support claims on Hitler and Zionism,"Ken Livingstone persists in mangling facts to suit his argument in his continued attempt to defend his comments on Hitler and Zionism. He took swipes at both “old Blairites” and the media on Saturday, and cited comments made by Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, at the World Zionist Congress, seeming to suggest the comments had been made in recent days and had gone unnoticed by the media. Livingstone seemed unaware that Netanyahu’s remarks, which he cited selectively in his defence, were made in October and caused a storm of controversy both in Israel and internationally. The Israeli prime minister was roundly criticised for suggesting that the grand mufti of Jerusalem, a Palestinian, had persuaded Hitler to exterminate and not just expel Europe’s Jews. His comments were so controversial, in fact, that Netanyahu felt compelled to clarify them: “Contrary to the impression that was created, I did not mean to claim that in his conversation with Hitler in November 1941 the Mufti convinced him to adopt the Final Solution. The Nazis decided on that by themselves.” The reality is that Livingstone’s latest attempt to defend his comments that “Hitler supported Zionism” in 1932 before going “mad and killing six million Jews” is in line with his previous controversial remarks, invoking dubious history to support his claims. The problem, as others have pointed out, is that Livingstone appears to conflate multiple mistaken notions to suggest Hitler “supported” Zionism – as if at some stage he had felt positively towards a strand of Jewish political thought which even in the 1930s encapsulated different and competing ideas and individuals. The reality is that Hitler had harboured hostile views towards Jews since the 1920s, which coalesced first in the antisemitism of Mein Kampf, published in the middle of the decade. There is a twisted kernel of truth at the heart of Livingstone’s claims when he alludes to the so-called Haavara (transfer) Agreement, although it took place in 1933 not 1932 as Livingstone suggests. Deeply controversial amid a Jewish European boycott of German trade, it saw an agreement between Germany and German Zionists to facilitate the emigration of Jews to British Mandate Palestine – not Israel as Livingstone states, which did not exist until 1948 - by ensuring would-be Jewish emigrants could transfer part of their property. As Yf’aat Weiss explains in an essay for the Holocaust Memorial centre at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, the Haavara agreement allowed “German Jews emigrating to Palestine to retain some of the value of their property in Germany by purchasing German goods for the Yishuv [the Jewish settlement in Mandatory Palestine], which would redeem them in Palestine local currency”. Its context, as Weiss points out, was as a deal forged under the threat of Nazi persecution. Following the end of Jewish emancipation in Germany, she writes: “German Jewry had to formulate survival tactics vis-à-vis the Nazi government of their own country.” The interest of some in the Zionist movement was to flee the rampant and increasingly dangerous antisemitism of the National Socialists, but the German interest in the Haavara agreement was both fear that the Jewish boycott of Germany might have wider economic effects - ultimately a misplaced anxiety - and a desire to push German Jews to flee. The Haavara agreement was designed to encourage the emigration of Jews from Germany in line with National Socialist policies, but it did not have in mind the foundation of a Jewish state in Palestine, a key tenet of Zionism. Indeed, by late 1937 an anti-Nazi German official involved in administering the agreement suggested that fear in Nazi circles that it might lead to a Jewish state, to which Hitler was implacably opposed, was leading to suggestions “it should be terminated.” Fatally for his garbled argument, in the final analysis Livingstone confuses agency and intention. Hitler wanted neither Jews in Germany nor in their own state. The Nazi vision was for the Jews to be removed from any kind of political influence. He facilitated some emigration in pursuit of a policy of ethnic cleansing to “concentrate” German Jews elsewhere. None of which amounts “to Hitler’s support for Zionism”, no matter how complex the history. As the Haaretz columnist Anshel Pfeffer summed up Livingstone’s three days of interventions: “His historical version of the Holocaust was only slightly more bizarre than his contention that someone who only hates Jews living in Israel – but not outside it – cannot be considered an anti-Semite.”",REAL
Smart guns: how Obama hopes to create a market for personalized weapons,"For more than a decade, smart guns have been stuck in a Catch-22: personalized guns don’t have a proven market, and buyers don’t want a gun they think is untested or hard to find. Now Barack Obama is trying to break that stalemate by creating a market for smart guns among law enforcement agencies around the US. Some gun rights advocates view smart guns with suspicion, fearing that the new technology will be pushed on gun owners unwillingly, as a New Jersey law tried to do in 2002. The guns use fingerprint sensors or RFID tags to prevent the weapons from being fired by anyone except an authorized user. “As long as we’ve got the technology to prevent a criminal from stealing and using your smartphone, then we should be able to prevent the wrong person from pulling a trigger on a gun,” the president wrote in a White House Facebook post late last week. In a Friday report, touted by the White House as a milestone in the president’s uphill battle to reduce gun violence, federal agencies said they were working with law enforcement officials to develop standards for smart guns that could be used by police officers. Once those new standards are released, the agencies will encourage law enforcement officers to volunteer to test smart guns in the field. They have promised that federal funding will be available to help police departments and other agencies buy new guns. If the technology can meet the standards – and if agencies can cooperate – the purchasing power of the federal government could be an enormous boost to the nascent industry. Executives “who are saying they are ready, wiling, and able to make a smart gun have been saying, ‘All that we need is a purchase order that’s large enough to turn the machines on,’” said Stephen Teret, a leading smart gun expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He called the White House’s smart gun plan “wonderful”. “I think it’s very measured and logical and it doesn’t force anyone to do anything,” he said. In advance of the White House report, some law enforcement officials had expressed trepidation that police officers would be forced to use the new guns, with one national police union official telling Politico that officers “shouldn’t be asked to be the guinea pigs in evaluating a firearm that nobody’s even seen yet”. The smart gun report, produced by the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Homeland Security, said the smart gun push was “not a mandate that any particular individual or law enforcement agency adopt the technology once developed”. According to the White House’s report, law enforcement agencies “will be invited to make voluntary commitments” about developing or buying smart guns. Agencies could volunteer, for instance, to buy a small number of smart guns to conduct a pilot program. Jonathan Mossberg, the CEO of iGun Technology Corporation, a Florida-based company that has developed a smart shotgun, said the White House’s push to support new gun technology could be a “windfall” for smart gun companies. He said his push to bring a smart gun to market had stalled since around 2002. “We’re trying to raise money, and I think this could make it a while lot easier to raise money,” he said. “More people can see the size of the market.” But Mossberg said he also worried that the White House’s push, particularly the pledge to subsidize the cost for departments that want to buy the new guns, would create an “artificial market” for smart guns. “Let’s say a gun company who has been against this type of development now sees an artificial market bolstered by the government,” he said. “They could pour all their resources into developing the technology and leapfrog over people like me.” Teret, the Johns Hopkins expert, compared Obama’s smart gun push to a 1968 pledge from Dr William Hadden, then the head of a federal highway safety agency, that the government would work collaboratively the the automobile industry to improve safety by adding airbags to cars. Hadden said the government “would act as a midwife to help deliver the airbags”, Teret recalled. “That’s what President Obama is saying. He’s saying the government can help with the delivery of the product to the marketplace.” Polls have found conflicting data about the support for smart guns among consumers. One 2013 firearms industry poll suggested only 14% of respondents would be likely to buy a smart gun; a more recent poll sponsored by public health researchers found that 43% of gun owners would consider buying a childproof handgun that could only be fired by its authorized user. Law enforcement agencies were a challenging initial marketplace for smart gun adoption, Teret said, because police officers had “heightened needs” when it came to their guns. A police officer’s firearm “has to work when the policeman is wearing gloves. It has to be able to work if he’s running through a swamp. It has to be able to work in zero degrees or 100 degrees. It has to work if it’s clogged with mud,” he said. A 1996 report on smart guns found the technology “was not quite ready for policemen”, Teret said. Since then, he said, “ready for policemen” has become the gold standard for gun consumers, with some gun owners arguing, “If they’re not reliable enough for policemen, they’re not reliable enough for me.” Teret said that it might make sense to try to market smart guns to more tech-savvy consumers, the kind of people who want the latest iPad, as well as trying to make inroads into law enforcement market. One small 2003 study of unintentional gun deaths found that 37% of them could have been prevented with a personalized gun. The widespread consumer adoption of smart guns might also change the dynamics of America’s illegal gun market, by making it difficult or impossible to use a gun stolen from its legal owner. Teret said that researchers did not have a clear estimate for how many gun deaths and injuries the widespread adoption of smart gun technology could prevent. But he said the personalized technology had the potential of reducing accidental shootings, suicides and homicides. “As long as we have a chance to reduce those gun deaths in a substantial way, why shouldn’t we do that?” he said. The National Rifle Association said it did not oppose smart gun technology. “We’re not against the development of smart guns – we’re against the mandated use,” NRA spokesman Lars Dalseide said. But the NRA did not welcome Obama’s smart gun plan with particular warmth. “President Obama’s obsession with gun control knows no boundaries,” Jennifer Baker, director of public affairs for the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement Friday. “At a time when we are actively fighting terrorists at home and abroad, this administration would rather focus the military’s efforts on the president’s gun control agenda.” The White House promised to release initial specifications for a law enforcement-approved smart gun on 15 July, and the final version of the specifications by 15 October. The White House also announced Friday that the social security administration was moving forward with a plan to submit some of its records to the nation’s background check system for gun sales, and that the White House would host a conference in May to talk to local leaders from all 50 states about gun violence prevention strategies.",REAL
British man who died in Norway helicopter crash named,"A British man who was among 13 people killed in a helicopter crash in Norway has been named locally as Iain Stuart. Stuart, 41, from Laurencekirk in Aberdeenshire, worked for the oilfield services company Halliburton. He was believed to be on a Super Puma carrying two crew and 11 passengers from the North Sea Gullfaks B oilfield, 74 miles (120km) off the Norwegian coast, to Flesland airport in Bergen when it crashed on Friday. All commercial passenger flights by the model of the Super Puma involved in the crash – an Airbus EC225LP – have been grounded in the UK by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), mirroring action taken by its Norwegian counterpart. BP and Statoil have also suspended the use of the aircraft model after the accident, so it is unable to carry oil and gas workers, the BBC reports. Tributes have been paid to Stuart, who was a member of Brechin golf club, where a flag flew at half mast on Saturday. Stephen Rennie, the resident golf professional and manager, told the Mail on Sunday: “The whole club is shocked and saddened to hear the devastating news about Iain. He was a very popular member of the club and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time.” A family friend, Charles Aitken, 75, said: “My daughter knows his wife, Amy. They are a really lovely family – it’s an absolute tragedy.” In tributes posted on social media, Stuart was described as “always a gent” and “a top bloke”. Statoil said the pilots of the helicopter – a Norwegian and an Italian – were staff of CHC Helicopter. The 10 other Norwegian passengers were employed by companies including Schlumberger, Aker Solutions and Statoil. Their names have not yet been released. The aircraft shattered into pieces when it smashed into the rocky shoreline of Turøy, a tiny island outside Bergen, Norway’s second-largest city. Norwegian television showed footage of what appeared to be a helicopter rotor blade spiralling down minutes before the helicopter crashed. A witness, Rebecca Andersen, told the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang that the helicopter’s “rotor blades came rushing toward us … Then we heard a violent explosion.” Emergency crews pulled the wrecked fuselage out of the sea on Saturday before an investigation into the cause of the crash. A team from the UK’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has gone to the site. The Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, wrote on Twitter about the “horrifying reports” and said she was being kept informed about the rescue work. She said her thoughts went out to all those who had lost a loved one. EC225 Super Puma helicopters were previously grounded in the UK after two crashes in Scotland in 2012. Both incidents, in which all passengers and crew were rescued, were blamed on gearbox problems. The aircraft were allowed to resume flying in August 2013. Later that month a different model of Super Puma, the AS332 L2, crashed off Shetland, killing four people.",REAL
Europe's liberal illusions shatter as Greek tragedy plays on,"Greece is running out of money. The government in Athens is raiding the budgets of the health service and public utilities to pay salaries and pensions. Without fresh financial support it will struggle to make a debt payment due in July. No, this is not a piece from the summer of 2015 reprinted by mistake. Greece, after a spell out of the limelight, is back. Another summer of threats, brinkmanship and all-night summits looms. The problem is a relatively simple one. Greece is bridling at the unrealistic demands of the European commission and the International Monetary Fund to agree to fresh austerity measures when, as the IMF itself accepts, hospitals are running out of syringes and buses don’t run because of a lack of spare parts. Athens has already pushed through a package of austerity measures worth €5.4bn (£4.23bn) as the price of receiving an €86bn bailout agreed at the culmination of last summer’s protracted crisis and expected the deal to be finalised last October. Disbursements of the loan have been held up, however, because neither the commission or the IMF believe that Greece will make the promised savings. So they are demanding that Alexis Tsipras’s government legislate for additional “contingency measures” worth €3.6bn to be triggered in the event that Greece fails to meet its fiscal targets. This is almost inevitable, given that the target is for the country to run a primary budget surplus of 3.5% of gross domestic product by 2018 and in every year thereafter. This means that once Greece’s debt payments are excluded, tax receipts have to exceed public spending by 3.5% of GDP. The exceptionally onerous terms are supposed to whittle away Greece’s debt mountain, currently just shy of 200% of GDP. If this all sounds like Alice in Wonderland economics, then that’s because it is. Greece is being set budgetary targets that the IMF knows are unrealistic and is being set up to fail. It will then be punished further for being unable to do what was impossible in the first place. Predictably enough, the government in Athens is not especially taken with this idea. It has described the idea as outlandish and unconstitutional, but is in a weak position because it desperately needs the bailout loan and threw away its only real bargaining chip last year by making it clear that it would stay in the single currency whatever the price. So Tsipras is doing what he did last year. He is playing for time, hopeful that by hanging tough and threatening another summer of chaos he can force Europe’s leaders to offer him a better deal - less onerous deficit reduction measures coupled with a decent slug of debt relief. For the time being though, the matter is being handled by the eurozone’s finance ministers, who want their full pound of flesh. The mood is especially unyielding in Germany, where Angela Merkel’s popularity has suffered as a result of her open door policy toward refugees. Faced with growing hostility, she has concluded that this is not the time to show any signs of weakness. She has sought to mollify German voters by giving her finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, a free hand to ratchet up his criticism of the stimulus policies Mario Draghi is pursuing at the European Central Bank, and by insisting that there should be no debt relief for Greece until Tsipras has done everything demanded of him. Merkel must pray that the lid can be kept on Greece until after 23 June, because it is hard to see how a repeat of last summer’s argy-bargy would help keep Britain inside the EU - rather more important to Germany in the long term than a few billion euros of debt relief. The reason is that David Cameron can only win his referendum by securing the votes of non-Conservative supporters, for some of whom the handling of Greece exemplifies everything that is wrong with the EU - its lack of democracy, hyper-conservative economic agenda and insistence that the single currency is a great success when in fact it has proved to be a colossal failure. Greece received the first of its three bailouts six years ago, when the terms were negotiated in the weekend following Britain’s general election. Gordon Brown was on his way out, but the then chancellor Alistair Darling went to Brussels to discuss the deal with fellow EU finance ministers. Since then, there have changes of government in all the big EU countries bar Germany, and most of the smaller ones as well. Voters showed their unhappiness by getting rid of the centre-right in France and the centre-left in Spain. They waved goodbye to Silvio Berlusconi in Italy and Mark Rutte in the Netherlands. It has been all change at local level, but no change in Brussels and Frankfurt, where the officials responsible for the eurozone’s bone-headed policies carry on regardless. Voters across Europe have got the message from the way Greece’s opposition to austerity was crushed - you can vote for whoever you like, but it won’t make any difference. The revolt against the status quo explains why Spain can’t form a government, the two parties that have dominated Irish politics since independence could barely muster more than 50% of the vote in the recent election, the runoff for president in Austria is between the greens and the far right and Marine Le Pen has support in France. To be sure, this is not a phenomenon exclusive to the eurozone. There is marked hostility to the US political establishment, and it is clear that many voters in the UK simply do not believe the government’s warnings about the economic risks of Brexit. The situation in the eurozone is worse, however, in part because the democratic deficit is so marked, in part because economic performance has been woeful and in part because there has been a dogged insistence on continuing with policies that have been both ineffective and unpopular. As Dan Atkinson and I argue in our forthcoming book about the failure of the single currency,* Greece was the point where progressive illusions were shattered. Until last summer it was just about possible to believe in a cuddly European polity dedicated to higher living standards, full employment and more generous welfare states. Then a gun was held to Greece’s head. Tsipras was faced with a choice. Ignore what the people want or see your banks go bust. This in a country which had seen the economy shrink by a quarter in five years. Difficult to spot what was awfully progressive about sucking spending power from an economy woefully short of demand. Then or now. *Europe isn’t working, by Larry Elliott and Dan Atkinson, Yale University Press",REAL
Diane Abbott says claims of antisemitism within Labour are smear,"Jeremy Corbyn faced further calls for a tougher crackdown on antisemitism within Labour on Sunday after one of his allies dismissed the crisis as a “smear” against the party and its members. Diane Abbott, the shadow international development secretary, dismissed claims that the party had a problem with antisemitism, provoking fresh criticism of the Labour leadership. She suggested the problem was procedural and instead lay within Labour’s rules governing antisemitic and other racist comments, which she said would be corrected following a review of the party’s guidelines. “Every single claim of antisemitism – I think 12 – has resulted in a suspension. Ken was suspended within hours. That is 12 allegations when 200,000 [new members] have joined the party,” Abbott said. “It’s a smear to say that Labour has a problem with antisemitism. It is something like a smear against ordinary party members.” Her comments, made on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show on Sunday morning, was followed by more criticism of the leadership’s response to repeated claims of antisemitism by Labour MPs and one major party donor. On Friday, Corbyn suspended Ken Livingstone from the party and announced an independent inquiry into antisemitism in Labour, to be led by Shami Chakrabarti, the former head of Liberty. It follows incendiary comments by the former London mayor that appeared to claim that Adolf Hitler, whose regime was responsible for the deaths of six million Jews, supported Zionism. Livingstone has refused to apologise to the Jewish community for the comments. He said this weekend the row was not about antisemitism but rather a plot by “embittered old Blairite MPs” to destabilise Corbyn’s leadership. In a heated exchange over the party’s response to the comments, Marr challenged Abbott to explain why, if Labour had no broader problem with antisemitism, the leader had announced an inquiry into the issue. The shadow minister implied that the problem was with the rules of the party: “There are issues about process. There is nothing in the rules about racism, antisemitism and Islamophobia. We are going to make the rules explicit.” Corbyn later reaffirmed his pledge to rid the party of all forms of racism. Speaking at a May Day rally in London, the Labour leader said the party “stands absolutely against racism in any form”. He said: “We stand united as a Labour movement recognising our faith diversity, our ethnic diversity, and from that diversity comes up strength.” However, Labour donor Michael Foster, who gave the party £400,000 before the general election in which he stood as a candidate, said some members of the party’s leadership continued to “vilify Jews as part of their political shtick”. He called for the Chakrabarti inquiry to be widened, and said on BBC Radio 4’s The World this Weekend he would not donate to the party nationally because of the leadership’s approach. Meanwhile, many others within the parliamentary party remained dismayed at the response from Abbott following contrite comments by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, on Saturday. Ben Bradshaw, the former culture minister, said Labour members were furious at how allegations of antisemitism had been handled. “I’m increasingly of the view that Ken Livingstone is a Conservative party spy who’s been planted in the Labour party and has been sleeping and has now emerged to try to do as much damage as he possibly can. “And that’s certainly the view of my loyal Labour party members and activists and voters who came up to me all day yesterday saying: what is going on? They were outraged by his comments. If he comes back into the party, they won’t vote for our party. It’s a really serious issue,” he said. Louise Ellman, the Jewish MP for Liverpool Riverside, said the response had been “much too slow”. The party is investigating a complaint that she has been subject to antisemitic abuse at a meeting of the local party. Len McCluskey, the head of Unite, Britain’s biggest union and the party’s biggest donor, criticised Livingstone and backed his suspension. However, he told Pienaar’s Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live: “This is nothing more than a cynical attempt to manipulate antisemitism for political ends because it is all about constantly challenging Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. “The idea that there is an antisemitic crisis within the Labour party is absolutely offensive but it is being used in order to challenge Jeremy Corbyn. Once the mood music of antisemitism dies down, then next week and the week after there will be another subject. It is an issue that comes up because somebody says something stupid and then immediately it becomes a crisis.” Corbyn announced an independent review last week and pledged to tighten party codes of conduct in an attempt to control the row over antisemitism, which has seen the MP Naz Shah as well as Livingstone suspended by the party. He has faced calls from Israeli politicians and diplomats to give a more “unequivocal” condemnation, and warnings – including from the party’s London mayoral candidate, Sadiq Khan – that Labour would be punished in the 5 May elections. Mark Regev, Israel’s ambassador to London, called for Corbyn to distance himself from Hamas, which he described as an antisemitic organisation. “The left has a wonderful, proud history of fighting antisemitism, but we have seen some language over the last two or three weeks which is very concerning,” Regev said. “They have the right to criticise the Israeli government, Israeli citizens do it every day,” he said. “It is about demonising the Jewish state. It is not about criticising this or that Israeli policy; it is about the demonising and vilification of my country and its very right to exist. “It is important that the leadership is not neutral or agnostic about antisemitism. I’ll give you an example; you have had too many people of the progressive side of politics who have embraced Hamas and Hezbollah. Both of them are antisemitic organisations. You just have to read their charters which read like The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. “If you are progressive, you are embracing an organisation which is homophobic, which is misogynistic and which is openly antisemitic – what is progressive about that? There needs to be an unequivocal message from the leadership saying there is no solidarity with antisemites.”",REAL
Barack Obama in surprise swipe at Clinton at final correspondents' dinner,"Barack Obama has taken satirical swipes at Donald Trump and, more surprisingly, Hillary Clinton and ended his final White House correspondents’ dinner by literally dropping the mic and departing with the words: “Obama out.” In the traditional tongue-in-cheek address to the Washington press corps on Saturday night, the president lampooned the Republican frontrunner’s foreign policy and business credentials while also mercilessly mocking the efforts of his fellow Democrat to appeal to younger voters. Obama did not linger on Trump for as long as some had expected during his half-hour speech, especially those who recall the correspondents’ dinner in 2011 where he roasted the celebrity tycoon as he sat in the room. Watched by an audience that included politicians, journalists, actors and Trump’s two sons, he pretended to wind up his remarks before interrupting himself: “No, I’m just kidding, you know I’ve got to talk about Trump. We weren’t just going to stop there. Come on! “Although I am a little hurt that he’s not here tonight. We had so much fun the last time. And it is surprising: you’ve got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras, and he says no. Is this dinner too tacky for The Donald? What could he possibly be doing instead? Is he at home eating a Trump steak, tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel? What’s he doing?” Evidently relishing this election year, Obama then made reference to Trump’s former ownership of the Miss Universe beauty pageant. “The Republican establishment is incredulous that he is the most likely nominee,” he continued. “Incredulous! Shocking! They say Donald lacks the foreign policy experience to be president but, in fairness, he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world. Miss Sweden. Miss Argentina. Miss Azerbaijan.” As guests erupted in laughter, the candidate’s claim to be a winner in business was also targeted. “And there’s one area where Donald’s experience could be invaluable and that’s closing Guantanamo because Trump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground.” Obama said he had more material but would leave it there, prompting the crowd to beg for more. He went on to make a sardonic-but-serious point about the avalanche of media coverage devoted to Trump, who has warned that any attempt to deny him the Republican nomination at the party’s convention in Cleveland, Ohio, in July could lead to violent protests. “I don’t want to spend too much time on The Donald,” he said. “Following your lead, I want to show some restraint because I think we can all agree that, from the start, he’s gotten the appropriate amount of coverage, befitting the seriousness of his candidacy. I hope y’all are proud of yourselves. The guy wanted to give his hotel business a boost and now we’re praying that Cleveland makes it through July.” At that, Obama shook his head slightly and grunted: “Mmm, mmm, mmm. Mmm.” Trump’s rival Ted Cruz received barbs for his recent reference to a “basketball ring” while campaigning in Indiana. Obama, whose father was Kenyan, said: “What else is in his lexicon? Baseball sticks? Football hats? But, sure, I’m the foreign one.” But Obama’s fellow Democrats were not spared. When Obama hailed Sanders as “the bright new face of the Democratic party”, the white-haired, 74-year-old leftwinger, wearing a lounge suit instead of a tuxedo, rose to acknowledge audience applause. The president said: “I am hurt, though, Bernie, that you’ve been distancing yourself a little from me. I mean, that’s just not something that you do to your comrade.” He then compared Sanders’ slogan, “Feel the Bern”, to an imagined one for Clinton that flashed up on screens: “Trudge up the Hill”, with the image of an “H” pushing a rock up a slope. “You’ve got to admit it though, Hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative who just signed up for Facebook. ‘Dear America, did you get my poke? Is it appearing on your wall? I’m not sure I’m using this right. Love, Aunt Hillary.’ It’s not entirely persuasive.” Clinton was also on the receiving end when Obama began his remarks by apologising for being late. He explained: “I was running on CPT, which stands for ‘jokes that white people should not make’” – a reference to a recent sketch by New York mayor Bill de Blasio and Clinton in which she castigated him for endorsing her so late, and he claimed to have been “running on CP time” (“coloured-people time”). Obama went on: “Here we are, my eighth and final appearance at this unique event and I am excited. If this material works well I’m going to use it at Goldman Sachs next year. Earn me some serious Tubmans,” – references to Clinton’s lucrative speeches on Wall Street and the recent decision to put the founder of the Underground Railroad on the national currency. As in past years, Obama made himself the butt of some of jokes, reflecting on the imminent end of his presidency. “I’m grey, grizzled, just counting down the days to my death panel.” He added: “Even some foreign leaders have been looking ahead, anticipating my departure. Last week, Prince George showed up to our meeting in his bathrobe. That was a slap in the face. A clear breach of protocol.” But he also noted: “In my final year, my approval ratings keep going up. The last time I was this high, I was trying to decide on my major.” He said he and his aides were mystified as to the cause of his popularity, while the video feed cut to a pictures of Cruz and Trump. There was also a spoof video, “Couch Commander”, in which Obama and old foe John Boehner, former speaker of the House, united to consider life after leaving office. Obama made a glancing reference to TV series Game of Thrones, described British actor Helen Mirren as “awesome” and, in paying tribute to vice-president Joe Biden, took a backwards swipe at George W Bush’s deputy Dick Cheney. “I love Joe Biden, I really do. I want to thank him for his friendship, his counsel, for always giving it to me straight. For not shooting anybody in the face.” The president’s speech clearly tickled the audience in the Washington Hilton ballroom that included Biden, John Kerry, Republican party chairman Reince Priebus, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and actors Mirren, Jared Leto, Bryan Cranston, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo, and Tom Hiddleston. Turning serious at the end, the president thanked the White House correspondents and praised a free press. “I just have two more words to say: Obama out.” With that, he held out the mic and dropped it, just as basketball star Kobe Bryant had recently done at the end of his last game. Obama proved a hard act to follow. Comedian Larry Wilmore’s routine had a more mixed reception, with gags about the media prompting groans but other lines hitting the mark. He ended on a poignant and unexpected note. “When I was a kid, I lived in a country where people couldn’t accept a black quarterback,” Wilmore said. “Now think about that. A black man was thought by his mere colour not good enough to lead a football team. And now to live in your time, Mr President, when a black man can lead the entire free world. Words alone do me no justice. So, Mr President, if I’m going to keep it 100.” Wilmore pounded his chest and said: “Yo, Barry, you did it, my nigga!” The Washington Hilton ballroom was crowded with celebrities.

A tough gig for Sainsbury’s Coupe,"Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s, is, by all accounts, a pretty decent guitarist. The regular Glastonbury-goer is handy enough with the instrument to have braved playing in front of 5,000 colleagues at several Sainsbury’s conferences. One wonders if, when he tunes up at his next gig, he’ll be playing a version of Can I Change My Mind?, the 1969 hit by Tyrone Davis (who may or may not be related to Coupe’s predecessor but one, Sir Peter). That track might be considered appropriate for a man who, having previously argued against the supermarket buying Argos, went and put in a bid for it anyway, once he’d taken over as the grocer’s front man. We’re sure to hear more about that deal this week when Sainsbury’s announces its results, not least because the grocery sector’s lyrics are beginning to repeat as much as those on a scratched bit of vinyl. The presence of the discounters still weighs heavily on the sector – even if the majors are under less pressure of late – while among the big four there are questions about what will happen to the seemingly recovering Morrisons (also reporting this week) if Asda decides to perform again. All of which means that talk about how the Argos deal might play out is far more likely to get the City on its feet. Take it from the top, Mike. Jenkins adds value The country has been deprived of the hypnotic oratory skills of former Barclays boss Antony Jenkins for far too long – but fret not. The great man returns to the podium this week. At a House of Commons event, run by the financial-services thinktank New City Agenda, Jenkins will revisit his favoured theme of “turning values into value” as he explains how the only way for the banking sector to generate sustainable returns over the long term is to act “at all times with good values”. “In the past, banks were too aggressive, too self-serving and too focused on the short term, and these events have led to trust in the industry sinking to an all-time low,” the publicity material for the event bills him as saying – and it’s hard to quibble with any of that. Still, before Jenkins was a crusading chief executive of Barclays, he had been in the driving seat of the high-street part of that bank as it merrily sold payment protection insurance (PPI) to people who never needed it or could have claimed on it. Strangely, that vignette seems to have been omitted from the publicity for this week’s event. Space constraints, presumably. Glaxo still not immune Protests at GlaxoSmithKline’s annual meeting in London’s Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II conference centre are nothing new – as anyone who owned shares during the tenure of former boss Jean-Pierre Garnier will recall. Campaigners used to gather to protest about how much JP was trousering. Investors had to squeeze past folk dressed in giant fat cat suits and others wearing T-shirts saying “Greed Still Kills” just to gain access to their free tea and biscuits. So maybe it’s not news that there’s a protest in the pipeline for Glaxo this week, when it holds its annual meeting in the usual spot, although the topic is probably more important. Shareholders are being urged to use the gathering to put pressure on Glaxo to lower the price of its life-saving pneumonia vaccines. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has just delivered a petition to Glaxo (and another to rival Pfizer) asking that the vaccine prices be cut to $5 for each child in developing countries. Glaxo says it has lowered the price it charges Gavi, the non-profit vaccine alliance operating in a small number of countries, to $3.05 from next year, just covering its cost. But Greg Elder of MSF asks: “What’s the point of a life-saving vaccine if the most vulnerable people can’t afford it?” Developing...",REAL
Sir Philip Green has big questions to answer over BHS,"Mike Ashley should send a bottle of bubbly to Sir Philip Green. The Sports Direct founder’s attempt to dodge a grilling by MPs almost seems a sideshow when there are bigger fish to fry. Two select committees – work and pensions; and business, innovation and skills – want to hear from the BHS bogeyman and have invited him to a joint session on a day of his choosing in the next few weeks. Green, unlike Ashley, will be up for the fight, one suspects. He loves the spotlight, feels his arguments aren’t being heard and may fear a consumer backlash against his Arcadia interests, notably Topshop. A refusal to attend would simply guarantee another verbal battering for a tycoon already branded the new “unacceptable face of capitalism” by one Tory MP. But a word of advice for committee members: please do not compete to see who can provoke Green to the greatest level of fury. That game may guarantee top billing on the News at Ten, but it is too easy to play. The BHS debacle requires forensic blow-by-blow questioning about the process by which Green extracted £580m in dividends, rent and interest payments from the business over the years, even as the deficit in the pension fund grew larger. We also need to know how he came to think a bunch of retailing amateurs led by a twice-bankrupt individual would be a suitable buyer of BHS, complete with those daunting pension liabilities. Here are a few questions to get the MPs started. BHS paid dividends of £423m between 2002 and 2004, but why did Green not divert some of that cash into a pension fund that was already heading into deficit towards the end of the period? What evidence can he provide that sale-and-leaseback property deals between BHS and the members of the Green family were conducted at arm’s length and on commercial terms? Similarly, how were fees calculated when BHS bought services from the wider Arcadia group? In 2012, the company and the pension fund agreed to close the deficit in the pension fund over 23 years. Why was such a long period deemed sensible? How was Green introduced to Dominic Chappell, the former racing driver who headed the Retail Acquisitions consortium that bought BHS for £1 in 2015? Why did Green regard him as a fit and proper owner? Why did he not seek approval from the Pensions Regulator for the transfer of the business? What discussions did he have with trustees of the BHS pension at that time? What contact did he have with Chappell’s consortium after the sale? It has been reported that Green made an offer of £80m – half in cash, half in the write-off of a loan – to top up the pension fund after the failure of BHS. Did he make that offer and, if so, why? What was the basis of the calculation? The MPs must do their homework because Green will have done his. Indeed, it might be wise to borrow a trick from Andrew Tyrie – the chairman of the Treasury select committee and a veteran in the art of cross-examining slippery bankers – and hire a QC to fire some detailed questions. Of course, the session should not be confined to gathering facts. There is a basic question of morality at stake: what responsibilities does Green feel towards 11,000 BHS staff and 20,000 pensioners? He owned the business for 15 years, and paid his wife fat dividends, yet sold BHS in an enfeebled state to a buyer lacking retail experience. Whatever the legality of his business manoeuvres, doesn’t he feel a duty to ensure BHS pensioners get every last penny of what they expected in their retirement? If Green can’t accept the moral case for writing a large cheque to close the £571m deficit, he will deserve every last drop of the MPs’ – and the public’s – scorn. It would be a shabby finale to a business career, but Green has a choice: does he want he seen as a decent man or as a shameless chancer? So Europe’s not doing so badly after all… The eurozone economy was bubbling in the first three months of the year. Never since the 2008 crisis has it expanded by 0.6% in a single quarter – 2.4% if extrapolated over the year. Such is the pace of growth that the 19-member bloc outstripped the UK and the US. UK growth was just 0.4% in the first three months, and statisticians in Washington said the US had flatlined. And this comes after GDP increased steadily for 18 months, putting a smile on the faces of tired eurocrats more accustomed to dealing with Greek debt or the refugee crisis. Even France was near the head of the pack. Its economy grew 0.5%, beating economists’ expectations and boosting the fortunes of socialist president François Hollande, who will stand for re-election next year. So much for Europe’s reputation as a bombed-out economic has-been. And yet there was talk of a false dawn, in part because unemployment remains in double figures and inflation dropped from zero to -0.2%. And just as US figures for the early part of the year are often upgraded, the eurozone’s are often later downgraded. Another barrier to a more sustained recovery is the slowdown in global growth recently documented by the IMF. Japan and China are struggling to maintain the export-driven growth that has served them so well, and Brazil and Russia are coping with recession. No wonder the Brussels elite want the UK to stay. They have avoided a crisis for almost two years and seen the benefits. Britain leaving would bring the EU’s brief period of benign expansion to a halt and worse, if the many economists who predict gloom for Europe following a Brexit are to be believed. They fear is not just political instability, but a collapse in trade and investment akin to the 2008 crash. The OECD said last week that financial markets were already increasing the insurance premiums they charged to hedge against the worst possible outcomes, raising the costs of trade. Brussels knows how ugly family crises can get and wants to avoid another. Time is tight at RBS Running bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland was never going to be an easy gig. But for Ross McEwan, at the helm since October 2013, it just got harder. On Friday, the market reacted badly to the idea that the bank will not be able to resume dividend payments until 2018 – a decade after shareholders last received a share of the spoils. The delay to payouts is one problem caused by the botched job of carving out the Williams &amp; Glyn network as demanded by Brussels at the time of the bailout. McEwan cannot be expected to take all the blame for what one analyst has rightly described as a farcical situation, but it is definitely his problem now. He has spoken vaguely of alternatives. Vagueness will not be tolerated for long. The City’s patience is wearing thin and the European commission is unlikely to look kindly on an already extended deadline being missed.",REAL
Devaluation is a dangerous game. But Britain may have to try it,"Ever since his first written evidence to the Treasury committee, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has hinted that he understands the UK’s real deficit problem. This is not the budget deficit, of which chancellor Osborne has made such a fetish, but the balance of payments deficit. Indeed, that distinguished former permanent secretary to the Treasury and cabinet secretary, Lord Turnbull, recently pointed out that debt owed to citizens of this country is not a problem – and that by not borrowing more for infrastructure at such low rates, Osborne is actually impoverishing future generations. He is, said Turnbull, “playing a dirty game”. On the real deficit problem, it is obvious from his various pronouncements that Carney can, for a central bank governor, be quite relaxed about a fall – let us call it an “adjustment” – in the foreign exchange value of the currency if it is necessary to restore, or at least prevent a further deterioration, in Britain’s competitiveness in international trade. Thus it emerged last week that the governor had written to Andrew Tyrie, the chairman of the Treasury committee, explaining that a 10% fall in the pound would boost economic growth by reducing the price of exports (or making exports more profitable) and encouraging companies and private individuals to buy more domestically manufactured goods. And the impact on inflation – which is already well below the official target – would hardly be sensational. But he distinguished between the effects of such a depreciation arising “for no underlying reason” and a run on sterling that might result from a vote to leave the European Union – commonly known as “Brexit”. He explained: “If increased uncertainty were a key underlying cause of this depreciation, aggregate demand might be affected.” Firms might postpone investment projects and households defer spending. Well, to judge from recent figures for gross domestic product in general and retail sales in particular, the economy may already be affected by concerns about the outcome of the referendum. These are deep waters, because our sensationally bad balance of payments position suggests that a major devaluation of the pound is needed anyway. I do not know whether Carney has read my good friend Sir Douglas Wass’s magisterial work on the 1976 sterling crisis, Decline to Fall, but I assume he worries that a necessary devaluation could get completely out of hand – as happened in 1976, when the balance of payments position was not nearly as bad as it is now, although inflation certainly was. The Daily Telegraph columnist Roger Bootle, of Capital Economics, and the Labour donor John Mills recently produced a “work in progress” pamphlet which argues that the kind of devaluation that might ensue from Brexit would be just what the economic doctor ordered anyway, whatever one’s position on the Brexit debate. Bootle is deeply Eurosceptical, and Mills is of the Leave persuasion. Likewise, the economist Christopher Smallwood, who chaired a discussion of the pamphlet, thinks that for this reason a panic about Brexit could have unintended good consequences. All this comes with the proviso that the pound, unlike Hemingway’s sun, does not also rise. For one of the problems with the fashion for a complete lack of exchange-rate management these days is that a necessary devaluation, as occurred in 2008-09, does not necessarily last. The result is that there is too much uncertainty for business to make long-term investment decisions. I seem to be one of the few who contend that the management of the world economy would benefit from international coordination to limit wild swings in the exchange rates that have such an influence on investment decisions. Indeed, when I wrote about this some years ago, I received a letter from that great former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker, saying that he and I appeared to be the only people in the world who approved of “target zones” for managing the gyrations of exchange rates. It is indeed unfortunate that, given our freedom from the fixed exchange-rate regime of the eurozone – one of the best British macroeconomic policy decisions of recent decades – our policymakers have made such a mess of exchange-rate management. Talking of which, I was much struck at a recent Llewellyn Consulting seminar by a presentation on Brexit from John Nugée, who, when at the Bank of England, spent some time at the coal face of foreign exchange reserve management. Nugée said we were in the world of “survival analysis”, recalling that great Bank governor Eddie George’s wise dictum: “It is never worth risking what you cannot afford to lose in order to win what you do not need to have.” Personally, I think the calling of the referendum signified a colossal failure of leadership by David Cameron. It is suggested he was hoping that being in coalition with the Liberals would mean never having to follow through on his pledge. But because his promise to hold one saw off the threat from Ukip, it guaranteed the coalition would not be renewed in 2015 – and therefore meant he was still on the hook. And if he thought the referendum would heal the huge rift over Europe in the Conservative party, the inside view is that he has another think coming.",REAL
President Obama's final White House Correspondents' dinner – as it happened,"And with that, the final White House Correspondents’ Dinner of the Obama administration came to an end with, if not raucous cheers, not exactly the hostile reception past comedians have received. You can’t say that Larry Wilmore killed: his humor – as it normally is – was a bit more of the wait-did-he-really-say-that variety, which is definitely not in keeping with the typical WHCD crowd ... which tends to think that he perhaps ought not to have said it. And, Wilmore’s jibes at CNN’s Wolf Blitzer and Don Lemon, MSNBC’s morning show juggernaut Morning Joe and the death of print journalism (all topics well-covered at the event in past years, but normally by the president) were pretty unpopular with the likely inebriated crowd, earning him a couple of loud boos from folks who probably ought to have known better. Laughing at himself is a skill the president managed to perfect at these things over the years; it’s one that not all the journalists in attendance seem to have mastered (though Don Lemon pasted a smile on and waved at the crowd). At least his reception wasn’t so poor that, like the year after Colbert made fun of George W Bush, the association will be tempted to find the most banal, grandparent-friendly comedian possible. And next year will bring a new president: the question now is whether that president will be able to laugh at him or herself, and how much material with which she or he will give the host to work. Wilmore ends by noting that, in his lifetime, we’ve gone from a country that couldn’t accept a black quarterback on a footbalk team to one that elected a black president. “So Mr President, I’m going to keep it 100. Yo, Barry, you did it my n*****.” On one of Obama’s biggest failed promises. “I just got a note from the president saying that if you want another drink, you should order it now because the bar will be closing down. Of course, he said the same thing about Guantanamo, so you have at least another eight years.” Returning to Obama: “I don’t know when we’re getting a black president again. I mean, they’re not even going to let Morgan Freeman be president in movies for a while.” On Ted Cruz: “Man, everybody hates Ted Cruz. Even OJ Simpson said, ‘Man, that guy’s just hard to like’.” “There’s a joke going around the internet that Ted Cruz is actually the Zodiac Killer. That’s absurd: some people actually liked the Zodiac Killer.” “John Boehner came out of retirement and described Ted Cruz as ‘Lucifer in the flesh.’ Lucifer! I mean, that is not fair. Lucifer is horrible, but he’s not the Zodiac killer.” “I don’t even think Ted Cruz wants to be president. I just think he’s criss-crossing the country Zodiac-killing.” More on Trump: “Morning Joe has their head so far up Trump’s ass, they bumped into Chris Christie.” “Donald Trump looks like the rich dad in every single episode of Law and Order where the frat kid accidentally strangles the hooker, doesn’t he. Or, as they say here at the Washington Hilton, ‘Tuesdays’.” On Donald Trump: “Donald Trump says he’s going to try to be more presidential, it’s true. He’s serious about it, too. So he says that now when he boasts about his genitalia during a debate, he’s only going to refer to it as his President Johnson. LBJ? Oh, very good.” “I can’t understand why everyone treats Donald Trump with kid gloves. And then I realized they’re the only gloves that will fit his stupid little baby hands.” On Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders: “Bernies’s been hanging around with rapper Killer Mike, or as Hillary Clinton calls him ‘Super Predator Mike’.” “Hillary Clinton was flustered when a Black Lives Matter protestor challenged her. I haven’t seen a white lady that upset over being blind-sided by a black person since Kelly Ripa.” On Bernie Sanders: “He recently had a hernia operation. His doctors say it’s his own fault, for trying to lift the hopes of the disenfranchised. You gotta stretch before you do that, Senator.” On Ben Carson: “He praised [Andrew] Jackson, saying he was a tremendous president. From the grave, Andrew Jackson replied ‘What did that jigaboo say?’” On Chris Christie: “He RSVP’d for three: him, his wife and Donald Trump’s dry-cleaning. Chris lost a lot of weight recently, didn’t he. He said he just eliminated everything from his routine that wasn’t necessary, like his self-pride and dignity.” After a few more anti-CNN jokes (one of which earned him boos “I used to watch it back when it was a news network”), it was Fox’s turn: “And not to throw any shade, but Fox News is the highest-rated cable news channel among viewers who have no idea what shade means.” And after joking about Fox’s wall-to-wall anti-Beyoncé coverage post Superbowl: “I think Fox secretly likes Beyoncé, though. They just renamed The Kelly File ‘Becky With The Good Hair”. On MSNBC: “Which actually now stands for Missing a Significant Number of Black Correspondents.” “MSNBC got rid of so many black people, I thought Boko Haram was running that network.” On broadcast media: “C-Span is carrying tonight’s dinner live, which is ironic, because most of their viewers aren’t. It’s true, guys. C-Span is the number one network among people who died watching TV and no one’s found them yet.” He also cracks a Jeb Bush suicide watch joke, to groans. On being in the company of the elite: “It’s nice to match the names to the faces in the Panama Papers.” On the death of print media: “A couple of years ago during this dinner,you were killing Osama bin Laden, remember that? Who are you killing tonight? Can’t be print journalism, that industry’s been dead for a while. Sorry! I’m just kidding. Shout out to the print media. No, really, you have to shout, they’re like all over 70 now.” Silence in the ballroom. On the president’s visible aging while in office: “Your hair is so white it tried to punch me at a Trump rally. The president’s hair is so white it keeps trying to say ‘All Lives Matter.’ No, man, you came in here looking like Denzel, now you’re going out looking like Grady from Sanford and Sons. I know it’s a dated reference, but you’re dated Mr President! All I’m saying is that, in less than eight years Mr President, you’ve busted two time-honored stereotypes. Black does crack. And apparently once you go black, it looks like we are going back. Thanks, Ben Carson.” Wilmore compliments Michelle Obama: “She’s the epitome of grace, class and poise. Not to be confused with future First Gentleman Bill Clinton, whose three favorite strippers are named Grace, Class and Poise.” He goes after Wolf Blitzer: “Speaking of drones, how is Wolf Blitzer still on television”” he asked, to a few drunken jeers. “Ask a follow-up question! Hey Wolf, I’m reader to project tonight’s winner: anyone that isn’t watching The Situation Room.” Wolf, and the audience, remained stone-faced. Wilmore compares Obama to Golden State Warriors star player Steph Curry: “Both of you like raining down bombs on people from long distances.” Wilmore suggests that next year the dinner will be called “Donald Trump presents a luxurious evening paid for by Mexico” and thanks “Mitch McConnell for not blocking my nomination. You gotta give Mitch McConnell credit: at this point, he could block LeBron James.” “Welcome to Negro night here at the Washington Hilton” he begins. “Or as Fox news will report, ‘Two thugs disrupt elegant dinner in DC.” And a response from Patrick Gavin: I wrote a while back that the White House Correspondents’ Association should use its biggest spotlight – this dinner – to shine a light on the struggles it faces. White House Correspondents’ Association President Carol Lee did an admirable job pointing out the Associations’ mission, but I wish she would have done more: Talking about the Obama administration’s persecution of whistleblowers and the difficulty of FOIA requests, to name a few. Her remarks on journalists under threat around the world was excellent. It says something that President Obama spent greater time talking about the current state of media than the Association itself. It says something about how perceptions of this dinner have changed during the Obama years that Obama now routinely mocks the dinner itself, noting that it’s “tacky” and a “unique event.” He routinely notes how he might rather not be there. I suspect this might be an ongoing trend. Best jokes: His “CPT” diss on Hillary/de Blasio Noting that he’s so hold, he’ll be meeting his death panel soon. Ouch, that Jake Tapper burn. Ouch, that Hillary-Facebook burn. (I counted *five* Hillary jokes) Ouch, that “And I’m supposed to be the foreign one” diss on Ted Cruz. “The last time I was this high...” It’s great to see a president casually poking fun at himself over smoking cigarettes and marijuana. Also: as we all might have guessed, Merrick Garland jokes are destined to ... bomb. And then he did the inevitable serious bit, and signed out for the rest of his life. Then he shows a video about what he’s going to do with the two years they’ve promised to stay in DC to allow their daughter to finish high school. It featured cameos from Joe Biden and John Boehner, the inevitable birth certificate joke and the second one about mom jeans of the evening, plus one each about LinkedIn and old people trying to use Snapchat. It was titled “Couch Commander”. You aren’t sorry that you missed it. But here it is: And more on Trump: “There’s one area where Donald’s experience could be invaluable, and that’s closing Guantanamo, because Trump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground. Alright, that’s probably enough, I’ve got more material. I don’t want to spend too much time on The Donald. Following your lead, I want to show some restraint, because I think we can all agree that, from the start, he’s gotten the appropriate amount of coverage befitting the seriousness of his candidacy. I hope y’all are proud of yourselves. The guy wanted to give his hotel business a boost and now we’re all praying that Cleveland makes it through July.” He initially fakes out the audience by pretending to segue into the serious journalism-celebrating part, but rounds back on Trump: “Although I am a little hurt that he’s not here tonight. We had so much fun the last time. And it is surprising: you’ve got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras and he says no. Is this dinner too tacky for The Donald? What could he possible be doing instead? Is he at home eating a Trump steak tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel? What’s he doing?” On Ted Cruz calling a basketball hoop “a basketball ring” in Indiana: “What else is in his lexicon? Baseball sticks? Football hats? But, sure, I’m the foreign one.” On John Kasich: “Meanwhile, some candidates aren’t polling high enough to qualify for their own joke tonight. The rules were well established ahead of time.” On the Republican race: “Things are a little more... how should we say this, a little more loose? Just look at the invitations to tonight’s dinner. Guests were asked to check whether they wanted steak or fish, but instead a whole bunch of you wrote in Paul Ryan. That’s not an option people. Steak or fish. You may not like steak or fish, but that’s your choice.” He then compares “Feel the Bern” as a slogan to Hillary Clinton’s: “Trudge up the Hill.” He added: “You’ve got to admit it, Hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little like your relative who just signed up for Facebook. ‘Dear America, did you get my poke? Is it appearing on your wall? I’m not sure I’m using this right. Love, Aunt Hillary.’ It’s not entirely persuasive.” He adds: “I am hurt, though, Bernie, that you’ve been distancing yourself a little from me. I mean, that’s just not something that you do to your comrade.” Acknowledging Bernie Sanders, “the bright new face of the Democratic party”, Obama says: “Bernie, you look like a million bucks. Or to put it in terms you’ll understand, you look like 37,000 donations of $27 each.” To former NYC mayor Mike Bloomberg, whom he initially compared to the other NYC billionaire leading the race for the Republican nomination. “It’s not an entirely fair comparison between you and The Donald. After all, Mike was a big city mayor, he knows policy in-depth and he’s actually worth the amount of money that he says he is. Obama “congratulates” Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus on earning a night off after the successful and uncontroversial conclusion of the Republican primary process. He also called out Helen Mirren. “Helen Mirren is here tonight. I don’t even have a joke here, I just think Helen Mirren is awesome.” And now for the annual jokes about the decline of the journalism industry: “I also would like to acknowledge some of the award-winning reporters that we have with us here tonight: Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schrieber. Thank you all for everything that you’ve done. I’m just joking, as you know Spotlight is a film, a movie about investigative journalist with the resources and the autonomy to chase down the truth and hold the powerful accountable. Best fantasy film since Star Wars.” He added: “Every year at this dinner, somebody makes a joke about Buzzfeed, for example, changing the media landscape. And every year the Washington Post laughs a little bit less hard.” The laughter was pretty uncomfortable. It’s time for the annual Joe Biden joke: “I love Joe Biden, I really do. I want to thank him for his friendship, for his counsel, for always giving it to me straight, for not shooting anybody in the face.” Speaking of his increasing popularity in his final year in office, he says “The last time I was this high, I was trying to decide on my major”, to a few loud shrieks of laughter. “Even my aides can’t explain the rising poll numbers” he adds. “What has changed? No one can figure it out.” And then he showed pictures of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. In a reference to Michelle Obama’s infamous lack of enthusiasm for being in Washington, he said: “You might have heard that someone jumped the White House fence last week, but I have to give the Secret Service credit, they found Michelle, brought her back, she’s sitting back at home now. It’s only nine more months, baby.” Obama takes a swipe at the press, noting that Savannah Guthrie and Norah O’Donnell left the White Hous e... and “Jake Tapper left journalism to join CNN”. Howls are heard in the audience; Tapper is seem taking a sip of wine. Obama says “Even some foreign leaders have been looking ahead, anticipating my departure. Last week, Prince George showed up to our meeting in his bathrobe. That was a slap in the face. A clear breach of protocol.” Obama cracks a “red wedding” joke, after suggesting that they consider Merrick Garland’s US supreme court nomination in the hall. After a series of jokes about how he ages and Michelle Obama always looks the same, Obama’s joke about being unpopular with Republicans falls flat. “In just six short months, I will be officially a lame duck, which means Congress now will flat-out reject my authority and Republican leaders won’t take my phone calls. And this is going to take some getting used it, it’s a curve ball, I don’t know what to do with it.” He pauses, waiting for laughter; the audience was waiting for the punch line. Enlarged prostate jokes always kill with the heavily male White House press corps: “Hillary once questioned whether I’d be ready for a 3am phone call. Now I’m awake anway because I’ve got to go to the bathroom. I’m up.” Obama makes a joke about being “gray and grizzled, just counting down the days to my death panel.” (It’s not his first death panel joke of the last eight years.) He adds: “If this material works well, I’m going to use it at Goldman Sachs next year, earn me some serious Tubmans”, references to Clinton’s now-controversial well-remunerated speeches to the financial services firm and the recent decision to put the founder of the Underground Railroad on US currency. Obama apologizes for being late, and says “I was running on CPT, which stands for ‘Jokes That White People Should Not Make’” – a reference to a recent, poorly-thought-through skit by NYC mayor Bill Di Blasio and Hillary Clinton in which she “castigated” him for endorsing her so late, and he claimed to have been “running on CP time.” (“CP time” means “colored-people time”, a racist reference to the supposed habitual tardiness of people of color.) The majority-white crowd screamed with laughter. It’s his last White House Correspondents’ Dinner speech, and he took the stage to the strains of “You’re going to miss me when I’m gone.” White House Correspondents’ Association president Carol Lee introduced a video of the presidents’ most memorable press conferences, touching on the passage of Obamacare, the killing of Osama bin Laden, immigration reform, the thawing of relations with Cuban and the Iran deal. It also catalogued some of the times he slipped, hit his head, repeated the phrase “be clear”, tripped up his words, failed to correctly identify the reporter to which he was speaking and wore “mom jeans.” The White House Correspondents’ Association is now handing out its journalism awards, and freed Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian is doing the honors. A full list of those awards can be found here. Read Rezaiain’s post-freedom interview here: Michelle Obama is on stage to present the White House Correspondents’ Association scholarships to the student winners. A complete list of the young people getting hugs from the First Lady can be found here. The Sunlight Foundation decided to troll the press corps in attendance at the TIME-People pre-party on Friday night (sponsored by Toyota, presumably among others.) The non-profit organization – which, among other things, maintains a free, easy-to-use database of all political donations – asked departing attendees to donate their ginormous canvas bags of free stuff to the charity, with little success. Watch video of their efforts – including the demand by one reporter “Don’t make us look bad by going to a party” – below. Last year’s swag bags were worth an estimated $550, including the LeSportsac bag in which they came. Like Donald Trump himself, Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs is not at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, but not because he can’t take a joke. Jacobs has a scoop on the New Hampshire Republican party’s apparent efforts to undermine the New Hampshire Republican primary winner, one Donald J Trump. In an email obtained by the Guardian, the state’s Republican leadership proposed a slate where the delegate chair and every committee slot would be filled by supporters of other candidates. In other words, while Trump’s convention delegates from New Hampshire are safe and sound, New Hampshire Republicans are trying to make sure that everyone else’s supporters will fill the committee slots – especially those slots on the rules committee, which may well determine how the convention functions and whether, in a contested convention scenario, Trump really takes home his prize.

And as C-Span cuts away from Wolf Blitzer chewing and toasting with Reince Priebus – they were drinking the Franciscan Estate chardonnay, according to C-Span, which got a not-bad review from Cheap Wine Ratings, though decide for yourself whether that’s a good thing or not – Patrick Gavin weighs in on what jokes he’s waiting for from the president and host Larry Wilmore. Things I’ll be looking for: Are jokes about Politico not funny/edgy anymore? (Politico’s break-every-news-story-down-on-the-basis-of-how-if-affects-the-next-election coverage was a source of constant humor in previous years, though they were also among the most DC-insidery.) Hastert jokes. Anyone dare? (Former Republican Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert was sentenced this to 15 months in prison this week for financial crimes related to molesting teenagers during his pre-Congressional years as a high school wrestling coach. Hastert admitted in court that he had “mistreated” some of the teenagers he coached.) Trump jokes: Sure, they’ll be funny but they’re also the low hanging fruit – easy and expected. Maybe we’ll see less than we think. (Or maybe not.) Any chance Wilmore brings up last year’s embarrassment? (During last year’s event, protests in nearby Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray in police custody took a more serious turn even as jokes about racialized violence were told on the stage.) Obama Nicorette re-loads. My guess is on a baker’s dozen. (The president infamously quit smoking before getting into the 2008 presidential race, and it was once a Washington blogger/gossip game to try to catch him smoking again.) I’m excited to be joined by journalist and documentary filmmaker Patrick Gavin, who is an expert on what the dinner was, is and could be. Hi! Excited to hop on board. I covered this dinner/weekend for 10 years at such places as Politico, Washington Examiner and FishbowlDC. I probably held the distinction of turning in some the dumbest coverage of anyone. (Sorry!) After a bit of a catharsis, I took a more critical look in 2015 with my first documentary, Nerd Prom: Inside Washington’s Wildest Week, and, ever since, I’ve become like the least popular in town all weekend thanks to some of my critical coverage. Anyway! So what should you know going into this thing? Here are the things about this event that depress me: The amount they give away in scholarships is pretty paltry. The Association itself doesn’t always practice what they preach. The cause of White House correspondents? It actually is super important and worthy of your attention. You could be forgiven for wondering the obvious: Why is the biggest event in a town with low approval ratings for everyone (reporters, politicians alike) a big self-celebration? Yeah, you’re telling me. Okay, let’s drink! Read Patrick’s OpEd for The Guardian today: After this, they’ll sit down and eat a fancy dinner prepared and served for 2,700 people and served by hourly wage employees. Catering staff at the Washington Hilton, where the event is held, are by and large people of color represented by United Here! Local 25. In other catering news, Trump’s SoHo property in New York has been accused by a former catering staffer of stiffing its catering staff on tips in violation of New York law. The catering, though, is handled by a subcontractor. If you’re watching the live feed above, and getting bored watching a bunch of people you don’t know get slowly drunk and schmooze with other people you don’t know, interspersed with their efforts to talk to celebrities without seeming like utter fan-boys and -girls, might I recommend checking out some quality journalism from The Guardian? The first American has died of complications the Zika virus. Law enforcement in Lebanon broke up a sex trafficking ring that had enslaved dozens of female Syrian refugees who had gone there to escape the war in their home country. And if you’re wondering why people call it “nerd prom”, they cribbed it from now-MTV news correspondent (and former Guardian columnist) Ana Marie Cox, who wasn’t being exactly kind when she coined it. Now, it’s used as a humble-brag, like “Oh, ho, aren’t I nerdy, here’s my selfie with Will Smith”; then, it was a way of mocking the annual desperation to get included on the guest list. Cox reportedly regrets having coined the term. Here is Will Smith taking a selfie of himself with the photographers taking pictures of him. If you’re curious about how the White House Correspondents’ Dinner went from being a self-congratulatory scholarship-awarding dinner to a self-congratulatory, celebrity-spotting spectacle, some more information on that can be found here. Carrie Fisher, attending the dinner as a guest of The Guardian, created the biggest red carpet stir by bringing her dog, Gary. As you may have heard, dogs don’t really like to be hugged by their owners, according to “science” but, since this is America and, in the current political climate, only uncontroversial science is accepted as fact (as demonstrated by climate denialism), it’s unclear how much of a difference any scientific findings will make to dog-owners. The red carpet is wrapping up as the stragglers head into the dinner, but we’ll continue to find something to cover (I hear there are other things happening in the world?) as the 2,700 guests tuck into their diver scallops, steak, shrimp, dessert and – according to C-Span – Napa Valley wines. Meanwhile, here are The Guardian’s guests, Tom Hiddleston, Carrie Fisher and Gary the dog, posing on the red carpet. (C-Span assures us that Gary was very popular on Twitter.) Just now on C-Span, People editor JD Heyman on celebrities and their causes. And I think it’s a natural impulse on the part of very wealthy people and powerful people to want to be engaged in that way [with a cause]. So I think it’s both for public image reasons and financial management reasons and just human reasons that people become involved in either political or environmental or other work related to causes. I know that most Americans may raise an eyebrow about the causes of some celebrities, but many of them feel the causes quite profoundly and do want to engage and feel like, you know, noblesse does not come without oblige and they should do something with their celebrity and their resources. Here is a picture of Kendall Jenner, of the Kardashian Jenners, arriving at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, which is dedicated to the important role the fourth estate plays in holding the executive branch of the US government to account. The dinner is, as you can imagine, not without its critics. New York City-based photographer Clayton Cubitt, a Bernie Sanders supporter, is among them. You can see some of hits Vets4Bernie portraits here: So is Tressie McMillan Cottom, an assistant professor of sociology at Virginia Commonwealth University. (Her essay on Prince after his death is a must-read.) And here’s a picture of prominent Sanders supporter and Clinton critic, Rosario Dawson. Eric Trump, Donald Trump’s middle son, says that he’s prepared to hear jokes about his dad. The Donald is boycotting because of how dishonest the media is, and not because he got made fun of a lot last year and has a thin skin. Read more about how he got zinged by the sitting president last year. C-Span reports that the dinner tonight will consist of “Petite filet au poivre paired with honey and orange infused shrimp, dunk confit, souffle potato, asparugus, zucchini, carrot and roasted peppers.” Americans in 2016, by the way, waste 50% more food than they did in the 1970s. Anyway, here’s Lady Mary from Downton Abbey. Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders is also a guest of the media tonight. And, if you’re a long-time Trump watcher, it’s perhaps no surprise to see Omarosa Manigault, who told The Hollywood Reporter at a pre-party that she’s “a Trumplican”. She added: This is a reality TV generation, right? They’re used to characters on TV saying whatever, doing whatever. Doing crazy things. Changing the game. That’s what we’ve done. We did that on The Apprentice in 2003. We’re doing that with the presidency in 2016. She currently appears on the trail as a Trump surrogate. Trump has not revealed if he plans to nominate her to a position within his administration. Aretha Franklin is in the house. If you didn’t see her perform at this year’s Kennedy Center Honors, why not take a moment and check it out. Emma Watson, who helped launched the women’s equality effort #HeForShe is also in attendance and looking pretty cool. If you’re interested in her work on women’s issues, perhaps you should read this piece about how rape survivors at the Mormon Brigham Young University are fighting back against honor code violations when they report their sexual assaults. Apparently, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is a Scandal fan. Helen Mirren is, like all of us, a Prince fan – but she wears it more than on her sleeve. Bill Nye is hanging out with Steve Aoki: There’s also Tony Goldwyn (the president on Scandal) with Shonda Rhimes. And Guardian US writer Steven W Thrasher is hanging out with Carrie Fisher and her dog, Gary. Currently on C-Span, two men are discussing the propensity for some women to wear something other than high heels under their gowns at the White House Correspondents Dinner C-Span host: Is it becoming more and more common for women to wear comfortable shoes rather than... JD Heyman, deputy editor for entertainment at People: I actually don’t think it’s ever... Women like to wear high heels for this event, but they will often try to tuck a pair, if they’re coming with a team of people, there may be a pair of more comfortable shoes in a bag. People tough it out, pretty much. There is a bunch of science about how terrible high heels are for your health. The red carpet has begun: on C-SPAN, all you can hear is photographers shouting at the top of their lungs, as celebrities are led one-by-one in front of photographers. Jeff Goldblum is speaking to Extra, Emma Watson has been spotted and Assad has ended the ceasefire in Syria. If you are the kind of person who tunes into C-Span before even the red carpet starts, you were treated to a look-back at George W Bush’s comedy stylings, which included jokes about Dick Cheney shooting people, Dick Cheney riding a segway, Dick Cheney being curious if the plot of Brokeback Mountain meant that the Lone Ranger and Tonto got it on, Bush singing off-key about how brown the grass is on his ranch and Bush conducting the Marine Corps Band playing John Phillips Sousa. Oh, here, look: protestors supporting of the Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr stormed the parliament building in Iraq, prompting the declaration of a state of emergency. Good evening, and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the “nerd prom”, the not-quite self-deprecating nickname for the annual White House Correspondents Dinner. This will be Barack Obama’s final turn at telling jokes behind the podium – and the current election cycle has given him plenty of fodder for his routine, which generally consists of zingers at other politicians’ expense, jibes at members of his administration and newsy references that would be cut from Saturday Night Live’s Weekend Update for being not funny enough. He’ll be followed by comedian and host Larry Wilmore, host of Comedy Central’s The Nightly Show, a The Daily Show spin-off for the former TDS correspondent. Wilmore has a typically tough job: to be funny without being offensive to the assembled politicians and media types, many of whom have an inflated sense of self – a sense not reduced by being in the presence of bona fide celebrities. Guests this year include one of Obama’s would-be successor, Bernie Sanders, as well as Aretha Franklin, Ilana Goldblum, Ilana Glazer, Will Smith and Rachel McAdams. Infamously, the last former TDS corespondent to host the dinner, Steven Colbert, bombed with the in-crowd, though he killed with viewers at home, in 2006 because he performed in character from The Colbert Report and didn’t pull his punches about then president George W Bush, the wars he’d started or his cozy relationship with the media. Wilmore isn’t expected to be as pointed about the incumbent president, but one suspects he has more than enough material on the potential next president with which to work. But before that, join us for coverage of the red carpet, a little commentary from Patrick Gavin, director of the documentary Nerd Prom: The Movie and a look at what else is going on in the world that is probably more important than the sight of media types back-slapping with the politicians they’ll supposedly go back to holding to account tomorrow. (And maybe some intel about Carrie Fisher’s dog, which is supposedly going to be seated with the General herself at the Guardian’s table.) CSpan is airing the whole event live on its site, and several cable news networks plan to cover it as well. At 6pm ET there will be a red carpet rolled out for stars of Hollywood, TV and music, political journalists of all stripes, and some of Washington’s most powerful politicians. Around 7.30pm the action will quiet, as everyone turns to the plates in front of them. And it revs back up again at about 9.45pm, when the president and Wilmore take the stage.",REAL
New Hampshire Republicans try to limit Trump's convention influence,"New Hampshire’s Republican establishment is trying to limit the influence of Donald Trump supporters at the party’s crucial national convention in July despite the presidential frontrunner having won the state’s primary overwhelmingly. In an email obtained by the Guardian, the state’s Republican leadership proposed a slate where the delegate chair and every committee slot would be filled by supporters of other candidates. Trump won overwhelmingly in the Granite State’s February primary with 35% of the vote. His nearest competitor, John Kasich, only received 15% of the vote in the state’s first-in-the-nation primary. Under New Hampshire’s relatively proportional rules, where any candidate who gets over 10% of the vote receives delegates, Trump was awarded 11 of the state’s 23 delegates. But the email sent by state party executive director Ross Berry on Saturday evening appears to be an attempt to deny the real estate mogul’s supporters such influence. Berry has proposed a slate that includes two supporters apiece of John Kasich, Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz and one supporter of Marco Rubio. The eighth slot is left unfilled. Delegates now have less than 48 hours to vote for an alternative. Any delegate wishing to vote for an alternative candidate is required to go through the time-consuming process of voting for a full slate of new candidates. “If you are NOT voting for the slate, you MUST include the name for each of the positions listed,” it says. While the Trump campaign has faced a multitude of challenges with delegate selection in states where that process is separate from the primary election, delegates are picked directly by the campaign in New Hampshire. This means that every delegate bound to Trump on the first ballot has been hand chosen by the real estate mogul’s campaign. However, even without changing the composition of the delegates, membership of the convention committees still has a major impact on the result of the nomination. In particular, the rules committee, composed of one man and one woman, has free rein to rewrite the rules and change requirements for delegates being bound by primaries. In this case, a rules committee made up of party members hostile to Trump could, in theory, change the method by which delegates are bound to candidates and therefore reduce Trump’s vote. It is likely to play a key rule in any attempt to prevent Trump from being the nominee in Cleveland. Jennifer Horn, the chair of the New Hampshire party who condemned Trump as “un-American” after his call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States in December, said the committee election process was “not something I am going to discuss with the press until it’s totally closed”. Horn is the state party’s candidate for both delegation chair and to be a representative on the committee on permanent organisation. The RNC did not immediately respond for a request for comment.",REAL
Man allegedly lured Navajo girl in to van to sexually assault her but left her to die,"A man who allegedly lured an 11-year-old girl and her brother, nine, into his van, attempted to sexually assault her, and left her to die in the New Mexico desert has appeared in court on Wednesday charged with her kidnapping and murder. Tom Begaye, a 27-year-old Navajo man from Waterflow, New Mexico, is accused of luring Ashlynne Mike into his van with promises of watching the movie Zootopia. The siblings were abducted after being dropped off at a bus stop after school, about a quarter of a mile from their home on Monday afternoon. The brother and another boy – their cousin – said no to the movie offer, but Ashlynne was lured into the van. The girl’s brother who, according to a federal affidavit released on Wednesday, also jumped into the van hoping to protect her, was later discovered walking down a desert highway where he had been left by the kidnapper. His sister’s body wasn’t found until the next day, her head bloodied and bashed with a crowbar. According to the affidavit, Begaye told investigators he removed the girl’s clothing, preparing to sexually assault her, and that he hit her twice in the head with a crowbar because she was crying and begging to be taken home. He also said that the girl was still moving when he left her for dead in the desert. US magistrate judge B Paul Briones told Begaye he could face life in prison if convicted of the murder charge. As he was taken away in an SUV after the hearing, people outside the courthouse yelled “bastard” and “go to hell”. Rickie Nez, a cousin of the victim who was in court to see her alleged killer arraigned on Wednesday morning, told the Guardian: “It’s horrible. We are a peaceful people; we care about one another. But now [one of] our own people has allegedly committed this thing, and it’s horrible. [Now] we have to start going to our schools and teach children to stop speaking to strangers.” The case has raised questions about the capacity of authorities to respond to abductions in remote areas of the Navajo Nation. Nez said that while the pair’s disappearance was reported by their father to the Navajo police just before 7pm, it took until 2.30am for the FBI to authorize an amber alert, a delay that Nez said would not have happened if the abduction had taken place in Albuquerque or Farmington. In the meantime, community members who heard about the abduction via radio and social media congregated to join in the search on Monday around 9pm and again on Tuesday morning, said Graham Binaal, a Shiprock resident who joined the effort. “Once someone put it out there that there was this missing child, then the word just spread from there,” he said. About 100 people from the community turned out to help look for her. It wasn’t clear why it took hours for authorities to get word out about the abduction, and the FBI special agent in charge, Terry Wade, declined to answer related questions during a news conference. A tribal official, public safety director Jesse Delmar, said on Tuesday that “every protocol was followed” in the New Mexico state police’s issuance of the amber alert. However, the tribal president, Russell Begaye – no relation to the defendant – said in the same statement that the tribe “needs to implement an effective response system in which modern technology is utilized more effectively”. Tips flooded in from across the reservation that spans parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah. Authorities said the kidnapper was driving a maroon van with a luggage rack but no hubcaps. In court, Begaye shuffled with shackles on. He remained quiet as the victim’s relatives and other community members watched the reading of the murder and kidnapping charges. Shawn Mike, Ashlynne’s cousin and the father of the boy who stayed behind, said he didn’t believe the family knew Begaye. The brother called him a stranger. Waterflow is a community of about 1,600 people, just a few miles west of the girl’s home in Fruitland. On Tuesday, hundreds of residents packed the Navajo Nation’s San Juan chapter house in Shiprock, to remember. Ashlynne’s father sat silently in the front as the girl’s principal remembered her as a kind child who was a part of the school band, and local leaders offered condolences. Ashlynne was fifth-grader at Ojo Amarillo elementary school in Fruitland. She played xylophone and had a performance just last week.",REAL
Body of newborn baby girl found in recycling plant in Ireland,"Police have appealed for help in tracing the mother of a newborn baby girl whose body was discovered in a recycling plant in Ireland. The body of the infant was discovered by a worker at the Greenstar plant just outside Bray, County Wicklow, at about 11 o’clock on Wednesday morning. The worker was sorting through rubbish when he found the remains which he initially mistook for a toy doll. Gardai have now launched an investigation into the discovery and have appealed for the mother of the child to come forward, as they believe she may be in need of urgent medical attention. Detectives said they do not know if the baby was stillborn but have confirmed that the child had been carried to term. Head of the investigation, Supt Pat Ward, said at this stage his main focus is on the baby’s mother. He added: “Mum can be assured that if she contacts us we will be as caring as we can to her. We are making a heartfelt appeal for mum to contact us.” It is believed the child died recently however further details, including the cause of death, will not be known until a full postmortem examination is carried out on Thursday. Ward said that officers are keeping an open mind about the death of the infant and told reporters that in the police’s opinion “it is possible the baby was stillborn”. “If that is the case my priority now is to get all medical assistance and support to the baby’s mum,” he added. Ward said the parents of the baby could contact either himself or Sgt Sorcha Fitzpatrick at Bray gardai station, assuring the parents that the team would deal with any contact “discreetly and sensitively”.",REAL
CBI calls on government to back manufacturing sector strategy,"Britain’s leading employers’ organisation will tell the government on Thursday that it needs to back a new industrial strategy to halt the decline of manufacturing and spread prosperity to the less well-off parts of the country. Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the CBI will strongly criticise the lack of preparedness for the crisis that has engulfed the steel industry as she urges ministers to do more to help in three key areas of weakness: skills, energy costs and spending on research and development. In a speech in Warwick, Fairbairn will say: “Modern industrial strategy isn’t about ‘handouts’ for business. It’s an investment in our future competitiveness which will pay dividends in sales, exports, jobs and livelihoods.” Despite pledging to rebalance growth towards industry and exports when he became chancellor in 2010, George Osborne has presided over an economy in which manufacturing output has yet to recover to its pre-recession level and the current account deficit is the highest on record. Business leaders have been privately critical of the hands-off approach the business secretary, Sajid Javed, has adopted, contrasting it with the more active role of his Liberal Democrat predecessor, Vince Cable. Fairbairn will praise the government for its support for the thriving car industry, but she will also use her speech to voice some of business’s concerns. Steel gives a sharp example of where we didn’t think long term. Where the answers didn’t come until it was too late”, she will say. “Yet the automotive industry provides the evidence that a clear, collaborative approach works. The industry came together, identified barriers holding back its productivity and put its top three proposals to government. “Government acted and deserves great credit for doing so. The results have been astounding.” She will say that every manufacturing sector should have a plan for its future, with each addressing three questions. “First, is the sector strategic for the UK? Second, is the sector currently globally competitive, and if not why not? Does the UK have a competitive advantage? Third, what actions could government and business take to make it more competitive?” Fairbairn will welcome the chancellor’s commitment to raising productivity and protect R&amp;D spending on aerospace, aviation and automotive, but question why he has not pursued the same approach for other manufacturing sectors. “Industrial strategy needs to be by sector, because that is how the world thinks and acts. And that is how our competitors are thinking and acting. It’s about co-funding from government and business in a partnership of equals. “The economic rationale is sound. Markets are not perfect – they fail in known and identified ways, particularly in the areas of skills, infrastructure and R&amp;D investment.” She will also say that government funding to support innovation lags well behind that in rival countries. “In 2014, the government’s contribution to the UK’s total R&amp;D spend was the lowest of the G7 economies – just 0.49% of GDP.” She will add that the budget for Innovate UK, the state-backed innovation agency, was 0.03% of GDP. “Is that really the best we can do? Numbers so small they round down to zero? This investment matters.” The CBI has long lobbied the government to reduce energy costs to levels similar to those on the continent, and Fairbairn will say that the additional burden is costing UK firms business. “For our largest users, electricity prices are still about 80% higher than the European average, double the cost of the USA. This has caused real headaches for our foundation industries. “Last year, the CBI proposed that foundation industries receive appropriate support for the costs of energy and policies that are making them uncompetitive globally. We achieved this. But in the longer term, we need a clear plan from government to help develop new energy sources while keeping industry’s costs under control.” On skills, Fairbairn will say ministers need to address a “chronic shortage of physics teachers”, adding: “This is holding back an entire generation of Stem [science, technology engineering and maths] skills which manufacturing depends on.”",REAL
"Oil giants should ditch high-cost projects, thinktank says","Shell, BP and five other top oil companies could raise their collective stock market value by up to $140bn (£97bn) if they set new strategies based on ensuring global warming is held to a 2C (4F) rise above pre-industrial levels, a new report claims on Thursday. These leading energy companies including Exxon Mobil should ditch high-cost projects in deep water and Canadian tar sands to concentrate on cheaper schemes that make money at low crude prices, says the report, Sense and Sensitivity, by the Carbon Tracker Initiative. The report follows shareholder resolutions calling on oil companies to undertake “stress tests” on operations in the face of stronger carbon regulation and weakening fossil fuel demand as countries move to lower-carbon economies. “A simple carbon sensitivity analysis shows that oil majors pursuing volume at all costs can deliver lower shareholder value than a more disciplined approach. That is why financial regulators need to make 2C stress tests standard practice for the energy sector to help avoid companies wasting capital,” said James Leaton, research director at Carbon Tracker, a non-profit financial thinktank. Shell and others have been criticised by environmentalists for setting allegedly unrealistic goals for their oil and gas output that could only be realised with the Earth’s temperatures rising by as much as a further 4C. The industry argues it is always trying to lower its carbon emissions while at the same time meeting the needs of a growing world population and helping to alleviate fuel poverty. The new Carbon Tracker analysis compares a business-as-usual value of the oil companies with one where only those lower-cost projects are needed to satisfy a reduced need for their products. “In a 2C world, the major oil and gas companies will need to manage declining demand for oil. However, this can still prove to be a value­-add proposition if they simply avoid developing high-cost, high-carbon projects,” said Mark Fulton, a former Deutche Bank analyst who is now an adviser to Carbon Tracker and co‐author of the new report. The analysis came as Shell reported first quarter profits down 83% to $800m and promised to speed up cost-cutting in the light of its acquisition of BG and a continued slump in oil prices.",REAL
Trump says of campaign sacrifice: 'I gave up two seasons of Celebrity Apprentice',"In his first sitdown interview as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump refused to back down on his longstanding – and long-since debunked – claims that Barack Obama was not born in the United States, and also refused to denounce antisemitic attacks on a journalist who wrote a profile about his wife. Speaking to CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, Trump doubled down on some of his most controversial and inflammatory positions, claiming his statements about the president’s nationality or his attempts to link the father of former rival Ted Cruz to the assassination of John F Kennedy were proportional to attacks waged against himself. “I’ve given up a tremendous amount to run for president,” Trump told Blitzer. “I gave up two more seasons of Celebrity Apprentice.” Blitzer asked Trump specifically to address his supporters who had sent “vicious” messages to journalist Julia Ioffe this week. After her profile of Donald Trump’s wife, Melania, appeared in this month’s issue of GQ, the Russian-American journalist received a torrent of antisemitic and threatening messages from supporters of the Republican frontrunner. “I don’t have a message to the fans – I’m not gonna talk about that,” Trump said, calling Ioffe’s story “nasty” and defending his wife against unspecified falsehoods in the piece. “She doesn’t need to have bad things said about her,” he said of his wife. Trump protested that he knew nothing of any antisemitic or abusive comments and threats directed at Ioffe. When Blitzer asked Trump about his past support of “birtherism” – the fervent and unsubstantiated belief that Obama was secretly born outside of the United States and is therefore constitutionally ineligible for the presidency, Trump pinned his past statements on his likely opponent in the general election: Hillary Clinton. “She’s the one who started it,” Trump said. The billionaire has long argued that the former secretary of state was the instigator in the birther movement, although evidence for this assertion has not surfaced. Trump, whose senior campaign staff have intimated to Republican party leadership that the candidate would moderate his tone in the general election, also refused to walk back statements on other hot-button issues, including his signature proposal to temporarily ban Muslim immigration into the United States. “I don’t know, I mean, look, I don’t know,” Trump said, when Blitzer asked if such a proposal would alienate America’s allies in the Middle East. “The migration is a disaster – we’re letting in thousands of people. They don’t have documentation, they don’t have paperwork, we don’t know who they are or where they come from.” In an interview with the New York Times Trump said he would implement the ban within his first 100 days, the paper reported. He also declared that his suggestion that US troop presence in friendly nations should be subsidized was still a key feature of his proposed national security platform. “If they’re not going to take care of us properly, we cannot afford to police the entire world,” Trump said, when asked if he would allow Japan and South Korea to become nuclear powers. “I’m prepared to walk, and if they don’t take care of us properly ... they’re gonna have to defend themselves.” When Blitzer quoted a military estimate that it might cost more money to house American troops in the US than in Japan, Trump implied that perhaps those troops were redundant. “Maybe you don’t need them. Maybe you don’t need them.”",REAL
Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff could face criminal charge,"In what are expected to be her last days as president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff has reportedly been accused by the country’s prosecutor general of obstructing justice. The criminal allegation – which she denies – adds the risk of prison to the woes of the Workers party leader, who is likely to be forced to step aside next week while the senate debates a separate impeachment motion against her. If the request for an investigation is accepted by the supreme court, it would also tarnish her reputation by placing her for the first time among the targets of the high-profile Lava Jato (Car Wash) inquiry into political kickbacks from the state-run oil company, Petrobras. Among those already under investigation are the former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the house speaker, Eduardo Cunha, the leader of the senate, Renan Calheiros, and about 50 other prominent lawmakers from across the political spectrum. According to local media, the prosecutor general, Rodrigo Janot, has ramped up the ante this week by asking permission from the supreme court to investigate 30 cases. As well as Lula – who is described as the ringleader of the Petrobras corruption scheme – they are said to include two of the most prominent figures in the opposition Brazilian Social Democracy party – Aécio Neves, the losing candidate in the 2014 presidential election, and lower house deputy Carlos Sampaio – as well as heavyweights in the powerful Brazilian Democratic Movement party, such as Senator Romero Juca and the Rio de Janeiro mayor, Eduardo Paes, the leading figure in the organisation of the upcoming Olympics. Worst hit, though, has been the Workers party, which looks set to lose power next week for the first time in 13 years. Among those whose cases were referred to the supreme court this week are Lula, the social communications minister, Edinho Silva, Jaques Wagner, who heads the president’s office, and the attorney general, José Eduardo Cardozo. The biggest news, however, was the reported inclusion of Rousseff, who is accused of trying to impede the Lava Jato investigation. Until now, Rousseff has not been implicated in a crime, unlike many of her accusers in parliament. Rousseff says she is innocent and blames a plea bargain by Senator Delcídio do Amaral. “Any opening of an investigation I am sure will show that Senator Delcídio do Amaral was lying,” Rousseff told domestic media. In his testimony, Do Amaral also said a “godfather” role at Petrobras was played by Vice-President Michel Temer, who is expected to form a new government next week. However, Temer’s case does not appear to have been referred to the supreme court. Janot has yet to confirm the investigations or to explain his motive for acting now, in the dog days of the Workers party administration. Some commentators speculate that he is helping the new administration by tarnishing the reputation of the old. Others suggest he is pushing ahead as quickly as possible due to uncertainty about the future of the Lava Jato investigation under a new justice minister. The supreme court must now decide whether to accept Janot’s requests, a process that could take months or years.",REAL
Justice Department says North Carolina anti-LGBT law violates Civil Rights Act,"North Carolina’s law limiting protections to LGBT people violates the US Civil Rights Act and cannot be enforced, the US Justice Department said on Wednesday. Meanwhile, in Alabama, the town of Oxford buckled under public pressure and repealed a recently enacted bathroom ordinance that threatened six months in jail for anyone found using a toilet not in line with his or her biological sex. Federal officials have recently warned states against discriminating against transgender students in school bathrooms, and a federal appeals court ruled in favor of a transgender high school student suing a school board for access to the boys’ bathroom. But the letter to the state of North Carolina from Vanita Gupta, principal deputy assistant US attorney general, marked the federal government’s first direct intervention in the conflict. “The Department of Justice has determined that, as a result of compliance with and implementation of NC House Bill2, both you and the state of NC are in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,” Gupta wrote to the Republican governor, Pat McGrory. The act prohibits employers from discriminating against people based on gender identity. “Access to sex-segregated restrooms and other workplace facilities consistent with gender identity is a term, condition or privilege of employment,” Gupta wrote. “Denying such access to transgender individuals, whose gender identity is different from the gender assigned at birth, while affording it to similarly situated non-transgender employees, violates Title VII.” The letter called HB2 is “facially discriminatory against transgender employees on the basis of sex because it treats transgender employees, whose gender identity does not match their biological sex, as defined by HB2, differently from similarly situated non-transgender employees”. The letter also cited Title IX of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination in education. If a court upholds the US attorney general’s position, the state of North Carolina stands to lose $861m in federal funding for schools. “This letter from the Department of Justice confirms what was clear from the start: HB2 is discriminatory and unconstitutional,” said Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, executive director of advocacy group Campaign for Southern Equality, which is based in Asheville, North Carolina. “We continue to call for the immediate repeal of HB2. We also call for the North Carolina general assembly to pass full legal protections for the LGBT North Carolinians.” The North Carolina law limits legal protections to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and requires transgender people to use public bathrooms that conform to the sex on their birth certificate. In Alabama, the city council of Oxford voted 3-2 to recall the ordinance it passed a week ago banning anyone using a toilet not in line with his or her biological sex. The law had declared that bathroom offenders “shall be punished by fine not to exceed $500 or incarceration not to exceed six months.” “The Oxford City Council did the right thing by recalling its discriminatory ordinance,” Chinyere Ezie, a staff attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center, told the Guardian by email. “We are pleased the council members came to the conclusion that nobody should be criminalized simply for using the restroom.” The Associated Press contributed to this report",REAL
Obama in Flint: water crisis is a 'tragedy that never should have happened',"The Flint water crisis was a “tragedy that never should have happened” in the US, Barack Obama said Wednesday during his first visit to the city since evidence of lead contamination emerged last fall, while residents jeered Michigan’s governor in his first public remarks before the community. “Flint’s recovery is everybody’s responsibility,” the president told a crowd of 1,000 gathered inside a high school gymnasium. “And I will make sure that responsibility is met.” The president focused his remarks on what he called a “corrosive” mentality in politics that “contributed to this crisis”. “Now, I do not believe that anybody consciously wanted to hurt the people,” he said. “And this is not the place to sort out every screwup … but I do think there’s a larger issue. “It’s a mindset that believes the less government is the highest good no matter what,” he continued. “It’s an … ideology that undervalues the common good, says we’re all on our own.” The president’s trip included a discussion with nine residents and a local pediatrician, Dr Mona Hanna-Attisha, who last fall uncovered elevated blood lead levels in Flint children. “I told them that I understood why you’re afraid, not just for yourself but for your kids,” Obama said during his 50-minute speech. “I also want to come here to tell you that: I’ve got your back; that we’re paying attention.” The president’s visit also ushered in the first public remarks to Flint residents from Michigan governor Rick Snyder since he conceded the city’s water was contaminated seven months ago. From the moment Snyder stepped on stage, attendees booed and jeered the second-term Republican governor, who won the state gubernatorial race in 2010 without ever serving public office. As he has in recent months, the governor apologized for his administration’s role in the crisis – but his remarks were brief. The former venture capitalist could barely get a word in without an interruption. “You didn’t create this problem,” Snyder said. “Government failed you.” Attendees countered back: “You did!” Moments later, by contrast, Flint’s congressional representative, Dan Kildee, received rapturous applause from the room. “This looks like Flint,” he said. Kildee criticized the efforts of emergency managers in the city who “made choices that had more to do with dollars and cents” than with the health of residents. Snyder appointed a string of emergency managers between 2011 and 2015 to run Flint, essentially stripping the city’s elected mayor and city council of power. In April 2014, as a cost-saving measure, the city switched its drinking water source from Lake Huron to the corrosive Flint river. State environmental officials didn’t require Flint to treat the river water, which allowed lead to leach off pipes before flowing into households across the city. A Snyder-appointed taskforce found that concerns raised about the river at the time “should have resulted ... in a full and comprehensive review of the water situation in Flint”. Kildee said there is an “obsession” with austerity in government. “We shrunk government to a point it wasn’t even in a position … to defend its own people,” he said. “And that’s wrong.” Obama echoed Kildee’s remarks, saying austerity measures lead to “systemic neglect” that diminishes “the life of a community and make it harder for our young people to succeed”. “It’s not just enough to fix the water,” he said. “We’ve got to fix the culture of neglect.” At a stop at a food bank earlier on Wednesday, Obama drank from a glass of filtered Flint water, in an attempt to encourage residents to drink filtered water. “If you’re using a filter … then Flint water at this point is drinkable,” Obama said, cautioning, however, that pregnant women and children younger than six should continue using bottled water. Residents have expressed the overreliance on bottled water, out of safety, has become an unnerving reality in the city. But, as a short-term measure, Obama said using filtered tap water is the “right thing to do”. “And, frankly, it’s going to be a lot more convenient than people traveling long distances to try to lug back a bunch of bottled water,” he said. The president said Flint should still push forward with an effort spearheaded by Flint mayor Karen Weaver to remove lead service lines across the city. Weaver has estimated the city needs $55m to complete pipe replacement, and only about $2m has been appropriated for the effort so far – enough to remove roughly 500 lines in a city estimated to have about 15,000. “That may be a long-term process,” he said. “It may take a year, it may take two years. … In the meantime, folks have to be able to use water.” Obama told reporters after the briefing that Flint parents should have their kids tested for lead exposure and said, with proactive measures, long-term health effects of lead can be reigned in. “We now know what to do,” he said. “We know how to mitigate these effects.” He also encouraged residents to flush their pipes so federal environmental officials can analyze whether Flint’s pipes are being recoated with corrosion-control agents. “So I’m urging everybody in Flint to participate in this flushing program,” he said. “Again, it’s a matter of turning on your tap in the kitchen, in the bathroom, five minutes a day, just to get that water flowing, getting some of the contaminants out. It will then be retested after that.” Weaver said she was encouraged to know that Obama is concerned about the “man-made” water disaster. “We didn’t deserve what happened here,” she said before Obama took the stage. “But we do deserve the resources to fix it.” The president’s visit was prompted by a letter from an eight-year-old Flint resident. Mari Copeny, who is known around the city as Little Miss Flint. Copeny urged Obama in her letter to meet with the community, as it would “really lift people’s spirits”. He also met with Flint residents in a community roundtable prior to delivering his remarks at the high school. “I am confident that Flint will come back,” Obama said. The president highlighted federal remediation efforts in Flint ahead of Wednesday’s speech, saying Obama has directed an “all-out” response to address the city’s water crisis: federal aid, prompted by an emergency declaration issued in January, has provided over 9m liters of water, along with 50,000 filters for Flint residents, according to the White House. Obama green-lighted an expansion of Medicaid coverage in the city for 14,000 children and 1,000 pregnant women. Snyder said on Tuesday that Flint residents would be available for the expansion next week. In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been authorized to continue providing water, filters, and water test kits through mid-August, the White House said. Snyder, whose aides first learned of concerns over lead contamination, publicly conceded last October that Flint residents had been exposed to high levels of lead. The governor, however, has sought to distance himself from criticism for his months-long delay in launching a widespread response. Nearly $70m is being appropriated by the state legislature to reconnect Flint with Detroit’s water system, begin testing for lead, and provide bottled water to residents. Snyder activated the national guard to assist, and has proposed an additional $165m for further measures. With 40% of the majority-black city living below the poverty line, however, residents say there’s still a disconnect between the needs of Flint’s 100,000 residents. The family of Copeny has endured a series of irritating skin rashes, even after Flint began pulling water again from Lake Huron last fall, her mother said this week. Lead isn’t a known cause for skin irritation, but state officials, along with assistance from the federal Environmental Protection Agency and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have continued to investigate what causes the rashes. Earlier, students and residents lined the road outside Northwestern, where organizers of a recall petition for Snyder gathered signatures. Nearly halfway through Obama’s speech, the president broke out with a momentary cough, prompting a light-hearted moment, when he asked to applause: “I’m gonna get a glass of water.” “Let’s make sure we find one,” he said. “It will be filtered.”",REAL
Muslim women kicked out of California restaurant sue for discrimination,"Seven Muslim women who were kicked out of a southern California restaurant are suing the business for discrimination, alleging that they were singled out for wearing headscarves in an area that advocates say has seen an increase in hate crimes. The women, six of whom were wearing hijabs, say they were ordered to leave Urth Caffe in Laguna Beach on 22 April, ostensibly because they were violating a policy limiting seating to 45 minutes – even though video they took as they were exiting shows that there were open tables throughout the restaurant. The business, which is located near the beach in Orange County, was half empty at the time, and other non-Muslim women seated far longer than the Muslim women were not asked to leave, according to the lawsuit filed this week. After the women protested, management at the restaurant, which boasts “organic coffees and fine teas”, allegedly called its security guard and eventually local police to force the women to leave. “I cried the whole way home,” Sara Farsakh, 29, said in an interview. “I was just so shocked and hurt by what happened.” Farsakh posted a Facebook video showing many empty tables, along with footage of the police who showed up to escort them out. “I am completely appalled by the racist and Islamophobic treatment some friends and I were subjected to by staff at Urth Caffe in Laguna Beach last night,” she wrote on Facebook after the incident. “What began as a night out with some friends ended as a painful and embarrassing reminder of what it is like to be visibly Muslim – even in liberal California. By visibly Muslim, I mean women who wear the hijab, or headscarf.” The complaint, which seeks unspecified damages, states, “Urth Caffe’s removal of Plaintiffs was motivated not by Plaintiffs’ violation of any company policy, but by its desire to cleanse the restaurant of visibly Muslim patrons who have been targets of recent neighborhood hate.” The restaurant has been the site of numerous hate crimes against Muslims this year, according to the complaint. In March and April, “locals unnerved by the increasing presence of Muslims in their community” threw eggs at Muslim customers at Urth Caffe, slashed their tires and yelled “racial taunts and epithets”, the suit says. “That’s really the key to why this is discrimination,” said Mohammad Tajsar, attorney for the women, who range from 25 to 29 years old. “There’s a clear motivation on the part of the management to appease the discriminators and the racists who had been basically annoyed and frustrated at the increasing presence of people who seemed like they were Muslim.” Laguna Beach is 90% white, according to Census data. Even if the restaurant did not directly address the women’s religion, it was a blatant case of prejudice, said Tajsar. “Discrimination in 2016 can be clear even if there isn’t an outward religious slur.” The restaurant has not apologized for the incident and instead defended its actions in a short Facebook post: “Urth Caffe categorically denies any and all claims of racial or religious discrimination against Sara Farsakh. While a full investigation is still ongoing, it appears that Ms Farsakh and her friends violated company policies and that the staff at Urth Caffe in Laguna properly and justifiably applied company procedures.” The restaurant’s “busy time seating limit” policy, a copy of which Farsakh posted on Facebook, says: “If tables are available, you are certainly welcome to enjoy Urth for as long as you desire.” In its statement, Urth said it doesn’t condone discrimination and “sincerely hopes that its customers will withhold judgment until all of the evidence in this case comes to light”. The restaurant, a local chain with locations throughout southern California, did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. Farsakh, a student, said she was compelled to file a lawsuit in part because of the increasing discrimination that Muslims have faced in the wake of racist rhetoric in American politics. Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee for president, called for a ban on Muslims entering the US in December. “With the current political climate, this type of stuff is increasing,” she said. “We felt so embarrassed and shocked. You can’t believe it when it’s happening to you.” Farsakh, the one woman in the group who was not wearing a headscarf, said she stopped wearing a hijab in part because of her fears about discrimination. “I shouldn’t have to be concerned about my mother, my mother-in-law, my friends and future daughters,” she said. “It’s unacceptable for anybody to have to go through this based off of the way that they look.”",REAL
John Crace’s sketch: LOQs give Dave a break,"Dave was fed up. Being prime minister wasn’t as much fun as he had hoped. Half his party now hated him for supporting the EU, Boris was gunning for his job, he’d been made to do a photo op with the comatose Zac – Jesus, was the guy alive or not? – and now he’d been forced into a humiliating climbdown over child refugees. Why couldn’t they have found somewhere to go on their own? Whatever happened to a sense of adventure? To round off a thoroughly bad 24 hours, he now had to waste half an hour on another prime minister’s questions. Sod it. He wouldn’t bother. “Could the prime minister explain his cuts in social care?” asked Jeremy Corbyn. Dave’s eyes narrowed. “Nah,” he said. “We’re going to do things differently this week. I’m going to pretend to be the leader of the opposition and I’m going to ask you the questions. So, you tell me why Labour is riddled with antisemites and why Hamas and Hezbollah came to your birthday party.” Corbyn wasn’t entirely happy at this turn of events. He hadn’t banked on being prime minister just yet. If ever. But to give no answer at all would be tricky. “I can assure you no racists ever came to my birthday party,” he insisted. “Can we now go back to the government’s social care policy?” “Absolutely not,” said Dave. “It is a complete outrage. It always used to be the Tories who were the natural home of racists and now Labour has stolen our policy. I demand some answers.” It would probably have been better if, at this point, Corbyn had tried to explain how, though Hamas had been at his birthday party, they weren’t BFFs and he had only invited them in the hope they might behave a bit better. Instead he chose to attack the prime minister for the Conservative party’s smear campaign against his friend, Sadiq Khan, in London mayoral contest. “You complete idiot,” shouted Sadiq, from somewhere in greater London “You’ve just cost me another 10,000 votes. We’re not friends and we never will be.” Dave saw absolutely nothing wrong in trying to make out that since Sadiq was a Muslim he was therefore almost certainly a terrorist. “Sadiq has been spotted talking to some extremely unpleasant people,” he said. “Some of them may even have been members of the Conservative party. This proves that if he is elected as London mayor there will definitely be a terrorist atrocity somewhere in the world at some point in the next two years. So vote for the dopey bloke instead.” With LOQs (Leader of Opposition questions) having descended into a toxic mix of competitive racism and electioneering, Dave cheered up a bit. He hadn’t had to answer a single question about his government’s social care policy. Which was just as well, because he hadn’t a clue if it had one. Just as he was about to congratulate himself on slipping off the hook, Dave remembered he had an appearance before the liaison committee later than afternoon to explain the government’s support for remaining in the EU. Damn it. There wasn’t much chance of him getting away with not answering the questions of every select committee chair. Still he’d give it a go. “Good afternoon prime minister,” said Andrew Tyrie, the committee’s capo di tutti capi. “Would you be recommending a remain vote in the referendum if you hadn’t managed to renegotiate anything?” “That’s a hypothetical question,” said Dave, evenly. “No it isn’t. It’s a straightforward yes or no.” “It’s definitely a conditional question because it’s got an if in it.” One down ten to go. Dave looked warily at the rest of the committee. At least half of them were angry Brexiteers who were bound to make trouble. Bill Cash wouldn’t be a problem because nobody took any notice of him any more. But Bernard Jenkin would be tricky. Conspiracy theorists always are. “I want you to take down every government website during the referendum campaign,” insisted Bernie. “Why?” asked Dave. “Because they will secretly talk to people to make them vote to remain.” “I think you’re overreacting a bit.” “I’m not, I’m not. I’ve got a legal precedent about a golf club notice from 1937.” A look of concern passed over the face of every committee member. They hadn’t realised just how unwell Bernie had become. But Bernie wasn’t to be stopped. “If you don’t obey me you can expect a letter before action.” “Calm down, Bernie.” “And then you’ll get a writ.” Dave was back where he had started the day, falling out with his own party. Now he came to think of it, he rather missed LOQs.",REAL
Arizona school poster describing girls as 'meat' and boys as 'wolves' is removed,"A poster at an Arizona school that compared girls to meat and boys to wolves has been taken down after a picture of it taken by a student was widely shared on social media. The poster, which has the caption “So you think you come to school looking pretty cute” under a picture of what appear to be scantily clad anime characters, then the caption “but what boys see is meat” under a picture of a wolf, was spotted in the library of Desert Ridge high school in Mesa, Arizona, by senior Alissa Adams during a class on 27 April. It goes on to say that “it is distracting … so they go on to get lousy grades … but then you end up with one of them anyway because he thought you looked HOT.” “As we started reading it, we all just started looking at each other like, ‘is this serious?’” Adams said. “It says that because girls dress revealingly, then boys will then fail because of us.” “[The class is] boys and girls, and everyone was offended by it,” Adams said. “I was so mad that I had to say something.” She said that she asked the librarian to take it down, but the librarian refused. Under the final caption, which reads “But it’s okay – because you looked cute today!” – the word “today” is underlined – Adams, who said that she was “so mad”, took out her pen and wrote “so it’s the girls’ fault, right?” and appended the hashtag “#feminism”, then tweeted the photo. The following day, the poster was removed by school officials. “That was nice,” Adams said. “Nice little win for us.” Adams said she had received “thousands” of supportive comments since sending the tweet, but also a number of negative ones. “People have tweeted me saying ‘you need to let this go’ and ‘go hide under your bed’, or ‘you don’t understand this now, but the world isn’t as good as you think it is’, and ‘you’ll understand when you grow up’, and I’m like – I’m pretty sure I can understand a sexist poster now.” “It’s just a lot of rude comments about how the post is fine, and I’m just a liberal loudmouth – and I’m not even liberal,” she said. “The poster was offensive. It doesn’t take a liberal to see that.” Irene Mahoney-Paige, a spokeswoman for the Gilbert Schools system, said in a statement that the poster had been in the library “for some time” and it was not clear when it was made or by whom. “The librarian hung it up last week and as soon as it was brought to the attention of the Principal, it was promptly removed,” the statement continued. “The Principal has spoken to the librarian and has also met with students and student council. Hanging of the poster was inappropriate and very poor judgement on behalf of the librarian. It is not reflective of the spirit and community of Desert Ridge High School or the Gilbert Public Schools District.”",REAL
Jeremy Corbyn's aide clarifies earlier remarks about local elections,"Jeremy Corbyn’s claim that Labour will not lose seats in Thursday’s local council elections but is instead seeking to make gains was misinterpreted, according to his official spokesman. The aide said his leader’s comment – “we are not going to lose seats, we are looking to gain seats where we can” – should not be taken as a prediction of what might happen. As the public prepares to vote in Scottish, Welsh and English local elections, the adviser said: “I’m telling you what he intended to say. He was saying we were not in the business of losing seats.” It came amid internal fears inside Labour that the party could be set to lose control of a string of English councils, including Dudley, Redditch, Southampton, Plymouth and Cannock Chase, although there is hope that Sadiq Khan will win the London mayoralty. One source said the worst case scenario was that 10 councils would be lost in the wake of an antisemitism crisis that has gripped the party for over a week and resulted in the suspensions of Naz Shah MP and the former London mayor Ken Livingstone. A Labour spokeswoman confirmed that three more activists had been suspended from the party on Wednesday and were facing investigations. That included the vice chair of the South Thanet party, Jackie Walker, who published an online post asking “what debt do we owe the Jews?” Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, said the furore was damaging the party’s prospects north of the border. “It has unquestionably had an effect,” she said, claiming that the subject was coming up on doorsteps. Labour council leaders campaigning hard across southern England told the Guardian that their battles were too close to call. Jon Clempner, Labour leader of Harlow council, said: “To be perfectly frank, it’s going to be very tight [to keep control of the council].” He said Labour campaigners were talking up local issues over national politics and the EU referendum. Peter Lamb, the council leader in Crawley, said some believed that Labour risked losing control because it only had a majority of one. However, he suggested it would be devastating for local campaigners if that happened. “Given the history of the seat it would be unprecedented for us to lose control in a year when [the national party is] in opposition,” he said. In Plymouth the council’s leader, Tudor Evans, said the party had had a good election night in 2012 and so was now defending 12 seats. The council is in no overall control but could be taken by the Tories if they win three seats. “It is on a knife edge,” admitted Evans. “It is too close to call.” David Cameron used his weekly prime minister’s questions on the eve of the elections to challenge Corbyn relentlessly over his links to extremist groups with antisemitic views, calling on him four times to withdraw having once described Hamas and Hezbollah as friends. The prime minister turned the weekly session on its head, ignoring Corbyn’s questions about domestic policy and instead declaring: “Those organisations in their constitutions believe in persecuting and killing Jews, they are antisemitic organisations, they are racist organisations, he must stand up and say they are not his friends.” The prime minister also hit out at Khan, whom he accused of repeatedly sharing platforms with extremists. Corbyn strongly defended Khan, whom he said was being smeared, and insisted Labour was an anti-racist party that would not tolerate antisemitism. However he failed to directly withdraw his previous comments about Hamas and Hezbollah. Instead he said that he did not approve of either organisation, adding: “Anyone who commits racist acts or is antisemitic is not a friend of mine.” The controversy could affect the party in the elections, with one poll finding that only 8.5% of British Jews would vote Labour in Thursday’s election. The survey for the Jewish Chronicle found that support has plummeted since last year’s election, when 18% of the paper’s Jewish community said they voted Labour under Ed Miliband’s leadership. Alan Johnson, the Labour former home secretary, told the Yorkshire Post he was concerned about the 18 suspensions over allegations of antisemitism. “I am worried about it. It’s not my party, it’s not the party I joined … These accusations need to be looked at and the people involved need to be rooted out and to make sure that we are anti-racist in everything we do and that we get rid of any racists [who] we might have [who] infiltrate our ranks. I don’t think it has an impact [on the local elections]. It might have an impact on mayoral elections. I hope not.” Robert Hayward, the elections analyst and Conservative peer, said the overall results would be seen through the prism of Labour’s performance. Corbyn will face a barrage of criticism if the party does poorly, with rumours in Westminster that some shadow cabinet members may resign and there could be calls for the leader himself to step down. “The risk for the Labour party is that [it] will be almost non-existent in southern England and hit fairly hard in many of its remaining bases in the Midlands,” said Hayward. Some are also warning that Labour could slip into third place in Scotland behind the Tories and slip backwards in Wales. However, on a more positive note for the Labour party, it is the Conservatives who have come under more pressure than other parties in council by-elections since the start of the year. Analysis by the Press Association finds that the Tories, who have faced controversy themselves over the EU and a budget rebellion, have lost 10 seats in town hall contests, particularly to independents, in recent weeks and have gained only two. In recent weeks, Conservatives have seen losses to independents in council byelections at Allerdale, Craven, East Riding of Yorkshire and North Kesteven.",REAL
Former chief constable calls for public inquiry into Orgreave clashes and beyond,"A public inquiry should examine the way Margaret Thatcher’s government used the police to occupy communities during the 1980s miners’ strike, a former chief constable has said. Sir Peter Fahy said the police attitudes that caused public outrage last week, following the Hillsborough inquest verdicts, were fostered by events such as the government using officers to crush one of Britain’s bitterest industrial disputes. Fahy retired in 2015 as chief constable of Greater Manchester police, one of Britain’s biggest forces. He said the use of police to serve a political agenda in the 1980s created a “them and us” culture, evident in the police response at Hillsborough. The legacy was still causing damage to the reputation of the police today as well as grief to families on the receiving end, he said. Fahy said: “It’s time for a public inquiry into the policing of the miners’ strike, not just Orgreave and the role of the police, but also the role of politicians. We need to look at the wider context of the way the police were used and the agenda set for them by government. Clearly it was about, in effect, national control of the police, in pursuit of a political agenda at the time. “We need to look at the way police in those communities were used as an army of occupation, created a culture of them and us – which people are concerned about at Hillsborough. The way the police force was used at that time helped to create a damaging culture. “The concern about Hillsborough is that the police saw it as an enforcement role and not public safety. If you are wondering how that came about, it’s about the culture created in the 1980s, from the inner city riots, to the policing of the miners’ strike, where the police then saw it as about enforcement and controlling role rather than a public safety role. Where did those attitudes [at Orgreave] come from? If you want to look at Orgreave you need to look at the wider context.” Fahy’s comments came as critics of the police action confronting workers at the Orgreave steel production coking plant in 1984 called on the new interim chief constable of South Yorkshire police to open up the force’s archives. The challenge from the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign came the day after Dave Jones, chief constable of North Yorkshire police, marked the moment he took over temporary control of the South Yorkshire force by offering to listen to activists, as well as to the families of the 96 people who died in the Hillsborough football stadium disaster. Barbara Jackson, secretary for the campaign, said campaigners would take up the offer from Jones but said they did not want it to be a token gesture. She said they wanted the chief constable to intervene in their legal effort to persuade the home secretary, Theresa May, to hold a public inquiry into the events at Orgreave 32 years ago. Arthur Scargill, the politician and trade unionist who led the National Union of Mineworkers in the 1984-85 miners’ strike, and was arrested during the disturbances, has also called for a public inquiry into the events. The rare public intervention by Scargill, 78, came as the Yorkshire Post said it had seen redacted sections of an Independent Police Complaints Commission report that the paper said revealed that the same senior officers and solicitor were involved both in the aftermath of Orgreave and Hillsborough in 1989. South Yorkshire police referred itself to the IPCC in 2012 over allegations that officers colluded to write court statements relating to Orgreave. The IPCC later said the passage of time prevented a formal investigation but said there was support for the allegation that senior police exaggerated pickets’ use of violence. The commission said on Tuesday it was now considering whether an unredacted version of the report could be made public. Jackson said: “We would be prepared to meet with Dave Jones if it’s going to be a productive meeting, and not just a token gesture.” The events of the “Battle of Orgreave” at the coking plant on the borders of Rotherham and Sheffield came to symbolise the miners’ strike. Large numbers of pickets were confronted by about 6,000 police from across the UK. Police charged 95 miners following the disturbances but the workers’ trial collapsed. Virtually all traces of the coking plant and the pit next to it have since been eradicated. Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, said: “As I’ve always said, we won’t have the truth about Hillsborough until we have the full truth about Orgreave. Finally, this report provides proof of what has long been suspected – that underhand tactics were used first against South Yorkshire miners, before being deployed to much more deadly effect against Liverpool supporters.” Burnham added: “Like the people of Liverpool, the mining communities of South Yorkshire now need to be told the truth about their police force and the policing of the miners’ strike. On the back of these revelations Theresa May must now order a disclosure process not just on Orgreave but on the policing of the miners’ strike.” The appointment of Jones follows the suspension of the South Yorkshire chief constable David Crompton, following the Hillsborough inquests, and the short-lived tenure of his deputy, Dawn Copley, who stood down from the temporary role after it emerged she was under investigation by her previous force for alleged misconduct. The Home Office said: “These powers are only to be used once an individual has been arrested on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence. They are reactive in nature and should not negatively impact community relations.”",REAL
Video shows Navy Seal's death was result of intense combat with Isis,"Video footage obtained by the Guardian shows the grueling firefight between US special forces, Kurdish commandoes and Islamic State fighters this week, in which a US Navy Seal was killed. The footage – filmed on a cellphone during the battle, which lasted more than half a day – reveals the extent to which the US military is once again engaged in intense combat in Iraq. Provided to the Guardian by the lieutenant of an elite Kurdish peshmerga unit, the video shows a convoy of four by four vehicles coming under fire near Tel Osqof, a Christian town about 30km north of Mosul. Amid the crackle of gunfire, peshmerga fighters and at least six US troops take cover behind an unarmored pickup truck on an arterial road leading into the town. One of the Americans appears to be saying “I don’t have a gun”, as another says, “I have a gun over here.” A peshmerga shouts: “Please save up your bullets.” Another peshmerga fighter asks: “Can we not ask for AK-47 bullets from the Americans?” Lieutenant Saad, the peshmerga fighter who shot part of the footage, praised the US forces that aided the Kurds in repelling the Isis assault: “If it was not for the American firepower, we would have more casualties. They are really good fighters.” Special Warfare Operator First Class Charles H Keating IV of San Diego, who hailed from Arizona, became the third US casualty of the latest US war in Iraq. In the video, a US Black Hawk helicopter with medical insignia is seen descending in an open field near a US and Kurdish position outside of the town before taking off again. While it is unclear if Keating was aboard the helicopter in the footage, a peshmerga fighter can be heard saying “it has come to take away the wounded”. After consulting with the Pentagon, the Guardian has decided to blur the visible faces of US forces at Tel Osqof. The initial description of Keating’s death provided by US Central Command and the Pentagon said that he was was killed in northern Iraq “as the result of enemy fire” and behind the front lines. Ashton Carter, US defense chief, described Keating’s death as “a combat death, of course”. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, also said Keating died a combat death, but characterized the overall mission in Iraq as something short of combat. “Our men and women on the ground in Iraq do not have a combat mission, but they do have a dangerous mission to operate in a dangerous country,” Earnest said. For years, the White House has argued that US troops in Iraq with adjuncts in Syria – officially 4,000 but often 5,500 at any given time – are an advisory force, not a combat force. Barack Obama, announcing a deployment of 250 more special-operations forces to Syria on 25 April, said: “They’re not going to be leading the fight on the ground, but they will be essential in providing the training and assisting local forces that continue to drive [Isis] back.” Yet details of the battle at Tel Osqof, provided on Wednesday both by frontline participants and the US military command in charge of the war against Isis, suggest that the suddenness and intensity of warfare can erode the distinctions between assistance and combat. Colonel Steve Warren, the spokesman for the command operating the war against Isis, said that Keating was part of a quick reaction force (QRF) spooled up in support of a US “advise and assist” mission that “just happened to be in that village” meeting with peshmerga leaders at Tel Osqof, less than four km behind the front. From there, the US advisers fought alongside the peshmerga in a gun battle with what Warren said were at least 125 Isis fighters. “Our forces automatically became embroiled in the ensuing battle,” Warren said, and called in the QRF. “It was a big fight, one of the largest we’ve seen recently.” Warren said that the mission of QRF force Keating was a part of was not to reinforce the US fighting positions, but to extricate the Americans from the fight. “That’s why the QRF went, to help extract them. It was a big fight. They were in contact [with the enemy], they couldn’t get away. So the QRF came to help ensure they were able to get away,” Warren told reporters. After being wounded by small-arms fire, Keating was successfully evacuated by Black Hawk helicopter to a medical facility in Irbil, the Iraqi Kurdish capitol, but his wounds proved fatal. Warren, who called Keating an “American hero”, said that Isis fired on the US helicopters but did not disable them. Warren said “our guys got out of there relatively rapidly” but specified that the fight at Tel Osqof lasted over half a day. Thirteen US warplanes, including two drones, launched 31 airstrikes, the battle continued at least into 9.30pm, Warren said. The Isis attack on peshmerga positions at Tel Osqof was multi-pronged and came as an apparent surprise. Before 6am on Tuesday, Isis militants bridged a peshmerga trench and crossed into territory held by the Kurdish forces. “In the past, when they attacked, they tried to fill up the trench beyond our berms with a bulldozer, but this time was different,” said a Kurdish officer, Major Ibrahim, who has fought Isis since August 2014. “There was a convoy of Isis humvees and there was a mobile bridge in a truck.” At least 10 peshmerga were killed and up to 30 were wounded while almost all the Isis militants in the 20 vehicles that breached the front line died. Peshmerga captured at least three US-made Humvees that Isis had itself captured from the Iraqi military in 2014. US aircraft including F-15 and F-16 fighter jets, B-52 bombers, A-10 close air support aircraft and drones launched airstrikes on more than 30 locations, destroying another 20 Isis vehicles, including a bulldozer. Warren put the Isis death toll at 58. When the Guardian visited the town on Wednesday, at least four mangled bodies were still on display in Tel Osqof. Houses with shattered windows were marked by bullet holes in their facades. Crushed packages of US ammunition littered the roads. Dlovan Jaffar, a peshmerga fighter, took part in close combat with Isis on Tel Osqof’s streets. Standing by a mangled corpse of an Isis militant on Wednesday, Jaffar said the Isis Humvees had advanced despite a hail of rocket-propelled grenades fired by the peshmerga. “We cornered three Isis militants inside a house, but then one of them blew himself up killing the other two,” Jaffar said. The Americans, he said, fought outside the town, alongside elite peshmerga fighters. “I saw an American helicopter that touched down near the entrance to the town,” he said. General Wahid Kovali, the leader of an elite peshmerga counter-terrorism unit that fought alongside the US forces, said the Seals and others fought heroically. “They were very good fighters, but they also had good guns,” said Kovali, whose forces are on the front berm across from Isis-held Iraqi territory. “It was a bad day for us here yesterday,” Warren said, claiming that Isis launched the offensive to distract attention from recent territorial losses in northern Iraq. Warren disputed that the US-led war against Isis, which will enter its third year this summer, is becoming more of a combat mission. “Our mission remains to advise, assist, train [and] equip our partner forces, both here in Iraq and in Syria. That really continues to be our primary mission,” Warren said.",REAL
And then there was one: Trump stands alone after shocking nomination race,"Donald Trump has finally secured a clear path to the Republican presidential nomination as his last remaining party rival signalled he would drop out of the race on Wednesday. Governor John Kasich of Ohio will formally quit the race with a statement in his home state at 5pm, following Texas senator Ted Cruz by stepping aside for Trump. The sudden capitulation sets up a November battle between Trump and Hillary Clinton for the White House, even though Bernie Sanders stayed alive in the Democratic race with a surprise win on Tuesday night in the Indiana primary. Kasich’s withdrawal, confirmed to the Guardian by a senior campaign source, marks the formal end of the most crowded and controversial race for a US presidential nomination in modern political history. The decision, made while Kasich’s plane was waiting on the tarmac at Columbus airport ahead of a planned fundraising trip, followed a similar announcement by his better-placed opponent Ted Cruz, who suspended his own campaign at an emotional press conference in Indiana on Tuesday night. “From the beginning I’ve said I will continue on as long as there is a viable path to victory – tonight I am sorry to say it appears that math has been foreclosed,” said Cruz. As the crowd shouted “no, no”, Cruz told attendees: “Together we left it out on the field. We gave it everything we got. But the voters chose another path, and so with a heavy heart but with boundless optimism for the long-term future of our nation we are suspending our campaign.” Using the word “suspension” to describe such decisions is typically a technicality designed to preserve a candidate’s legal ability to continue raising funds while the campaign winds up. Both Cruz and Kasich bowed to the near mathematical certainty that Trump will now win a clear majority of delegates, reaching the 1,237 threshold needed to clinch the nomination. And they also acknowledged calls by the Republican National Committee to unite around the “presumptive nominee”. But the scale of the political reconciliation required for this to happen was made clear on Wednesday when Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire – one of several moderate senators facing a bumpy re-election with Trump at the top of the party ballot in November – said she would be “supporting, but not endorsing” his candidacy. Arizona senator John McCain, another previously vocal opponent of Trump, said he would support the party’s nominee, but initially declined to refer to him directly by name. A former speechwriter for McCain, who was the party nominee in 2008, said he would rather vote for Hillary Clinton than Trump. Many party leaders, including opponents in the primary, will now be under similar pressure to announce their support for Trump, despite months of public misgivings about his lack of political experience, attacks on women and minorities, and poor polling numbers among independent voters. Despite fervent support among Republican primary votes, Trump suffers from the worst national opinion poll ratings of any candidate of either party since at least 1984, with 67% of Americans thinking of him unfavorably. Earlier on Wednesday, despite barely registering in Indiana, where he had encouraged supporters to vote for Cruz, Kasich issued a defiant statement suggesting he would continue to contest remaining primary elections. Taking his cue from the “May the Fourth” Star Wars celebration, Kasich released a spoof video to the film’s theme tune describing a nightmare scenario for Republicans in which Trump’s nomination ushers not just a Clinton landslide, but allows Democrats to win back control of the House of Representatives and Senate. “The country is depending on Indiana,” added Cruz on Tuesday before the primary results came in. “If Indiana does not act, this country could well plunge into the abyss … We are not a proud, boastful, self-centered, mean-spirited, hateful, bullying nation.” But Trump swept his opponents before him in the Hoosier State, clinching 53% of the votes and almost all the delegates as his strident attacks on free trade agreements and immigration appeared to resonate in a midwest state hit hard by globalisation. The New York billionaire is almost certain to face Clinton in November’s election, but voters in Indiana also showed her difficulties in fighting this economic populism. Her Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders threw a last-minute hurdle in front of Clinton’s march toward the Democratic party nomination on Tuesday by clinching a surprise victory in the Indiana primary. Despite trailing by an average of seven points in opinion polls and losing a string of bigger, more diverse states on the east coast, Sanders once again proved his appeal to disaffected midwest voters by pulling off his 18th victory of 2016, winning 52.7% of the votes to Clinton’s 47.3%. “The Clinton campaign thinks this campaign is over,” said Sanders. “They’re wrong. Maybe it’s over for the insiders and the party establishment, but the voters in Indiana had a different idea.” Nonetheless, the former secretary of state is nearly 300 pledged delegates ahead of her Vermont rival and within less than 200 delegates of crossing the finish line including the controversial superdelegates – party figures who are able to vote independently of election results and overwhelmingly back Clinton. Choosing to focus on her Republican opponent, Clinton pointedly ignored the surprise Sanders upset in favor of a full frontal attack on Trump. “Chip in now if you agree we can’t let him become president,” she urged her supporters in a swift fundraising email. And later on Wednesday, Clinton took to Twitter to unveil a new “Love trumps hate” slogan, declaring: “Unity versus division, compassion versus selfishness and love versus hate. The stakes don’t get much higher.”",REAL
"David Cameron will not retract criticism of Donald Trump, No 10 says","David Cameron has no intention of withdrawing his claim that Donald Trump was “divisive, stupid and wrong” to call for a ban on Muslims entering the US, Downing Street has said. Despite Trump’s likely confirmation as the Republican presidential candidate, a spokesman for Cameron said the prime minister stood by his comments made in December last year. It comes after George Papadopoulos, an adviser to Trump, told the Times on Wednesday that he thought Cameron should reach out with an apology or some sort of retraction. Asked whether Cameron stuck by the comments, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had “no intention of withdrawing his comments, which were made in response to comments that Donald Trump made calling for a ban on Muslims entering the US, that was the context for the PM’s comments”. No 10 said there would be contact with the Republican and Democrat presidential campaigns, but no plans in the diary for Cameron to meet Trump. Cameron previously met Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential candidate, when he was running in 2012. Papadopoulos said Cameron’s comments were uncalled-for and it would be wise for the prime minister to “reach out in a more positive manner” to the Republican frontrunner. Asked if Trump would forgive the remarks, he said: “I can’t speak directly for him, but it would seem that if Prime Minister Cameron is serious about reaching out, not only to Mr Trump’s advisers but to the man himself, an apology or some sort of retraction should happen. “To see Mr Cameron come out as the most vocal opponent was uncalled for. Considering that we believe that the UK-US relationship should be a cornerstone, not just of Nato policy but elsewhere, it would be wise for him to reach out in a more positive manner to Mr Trump.” Cameron previously said he had nothing to add or subtract from his remarks when asked about them at a joint press conference with the US president, Barack Obama, in the Foreign Office last month. But he has repeatedly declined further invitations to comment on Trump’s chances, saying the election is a matter for the American people.",REAL
Alaska plane struck bald eagle before crash in first ever fatal collision,"A small plane hit a bald eagle before it crashed just north of Anchorage, Alaska, last month, killing all four people on board. An investigator said it is the nation’s first civilian plane crash to result in deaths after an impact with a bald eagle. Shaun Williams with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said there have been other crashes involving eagle strikes that resulted in serious injuries, not deaths. The pilot, co-pilot and two passengers died when the plane went down on 20 April near a small airport about 20 miles north of Anchorage. Williams says an unknown substance was later found on the aircraft. Analysis at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC determined some of it was feathers and other materials that came from an immature bald eagle. According to the Alaska Dispatch News, one of the pilots was a 64-year-old former investigator who previously worked for the NTSB, an independent federal agency that investigates every civil aviation accident.",REAL
David Cameron calls for political courage to seal TTIP deal,"David Cameron has said a trade deal between the EU and US is not dead despite France threatening to veto the proposal in its current form. The prime minister said it would take “political courage to get it over the line” but the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) would be good for British people. He insisted TTIP was still viable despite François Hollande saying on Tuesday that he would reject it “at this stage” because France was opposed to unregulated free trade. All 28 EU member states and the European parliament would have to ratify TTIP before it comes into force, after 13 rounds of negotiations spread over nearly three years. Barack Obama has said completing TTIP with the EU is a priority for his country, and that in the event of Brexit the UK would have to go to the back of the queue for a trade deal. The proposed deal has gained in prominence over recent months as some Eurosceptics claim the UK could put a halt to it by leaving the EU. Campaigners against TTIP, who include the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and groups such as Greenpeace, argue that it could lead to weakening of regulation and open up the NHS to more privatisation. Cameron said concern over the possible impact on the NHS and public services was “the reddest of red herrings”. “The health service is completely protected under this agreement as it is under other agreements,” he told the Commons. “Look, there are all sorts of reasons people might be against free trade and wanting to see an expansion of trade and investment and jobs. I think people should be honest about it and say they don’t want to see these things happen, rather than actually finding total red herrings for getting in the way of what could add tens of billions of pounds to our economy and bring jobs and investment to our country.” He later confirmed that the UK was still pushing for the completion of TTIP. During a session of the Commons liaison committee, Cameron was taken to task by Eurosceptic Tories including Bernard Jenkin and Bill Cash. Jenkin warned the prime minister to “expect a writ” if the government kept posts making the case for Britain to remain in the EU on its website right up until the referendum. Jenkin said it would be illegal to keep pages on the Gov.uk website during the so-called purdah period in the last few weeks of the campaign. “Expect a letter before action. If we can raise the funds, expect a writ,” he said. Cameron replied: “I’d better get back to the office fast then.” During the lengthy session, Cameron brushed off claims by the Brexit campaign that staying in the EU could lead to a wave of migration from Turkey. “I will be absolutely frank with you, I don’t think the accession of Turkey to the European Union is remotely on the cards. I don’t think it will happen for decades,” he said. “If you look at the facts, the facts are that it requires unanimity of all European members. The French, for instance, have said they’d have a referendum on it. “I would say very clearly to people: if your vote in this referendum is being influenced by considerations about Turkish membership of the EU, don’t think about it. It’s not remotely on the cards. It’s not an issue in this referendum and it shouldn’t be.” He suggested it would be safer to stay in the EU to avoid the risk of the UK being broken up through a second independence referendum. “I would argue to anyone in the United Kingdom who cares as passionately as I do about keeping the United Kingdom together that the safe and sensible choice is to vote to stay in a reformed European Union,” Cameron said.",REAL
Expanded recall for deadly Takata airbags to impact one in four US cars,"US regulators have more than doubled the recall of Takata airbag inflators to include tens of millions more cars, making the order the largest automotive recall in history. The inflators, meant to save people in the event of a crash, are prone to explode, expelling fragments of metal. Some 63.8m cars are affected in the US – equivalent to more than a quarter of the vehicles on US roads. As of Wednesday morning the inflators were known to have killed a dozen people – 11 in the US and one in Malaysia – and hurt more than 100 others. At a press conference in Washington on Wednesday afternoon, however, National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHSTA) administrator Mark Rosekind said he had learned from Honda that two more people had been killed by the faulty auto part in Malaysia in the past three weeks. In Houston, Texas last month, a teenage girl was killed in a minor collision that triggered the airbag, when the Takata inflator exploded. “Please,” Rosekind asked reporters, “as you report your stories, include this. Vehicle owners who have received notice that there are parts available for their repair should take action immediately.” Makes and models affected are listed in a special page on the NHSTA website or by vehicle identification number. The models from the expanded recall are not included yet, according to the regulator’s guide, but users can sign up for an alert tailored to the car they own. NHSTA has said the top priority for replacing airbags goes to “high absolute humidity” areas across the American south-east and island territories and encouraged car owners to keep checking the page. Over time, humid conditions can alter the composition of ammonium nitrate and a trying agent, chemicals that react to deploys of the air bag and increase the likelihood of an explosion. Ruptures are much less likely in new vehicles. The recall already affects 28.8m cars in the US; the NHSTA said it had fixed 8.17m of the faulty products as of 22 April. The accelerated recall adds between 35m and 40m new cars to the list, Rosekind said. “I’m going to make this personal: my family has a vehicle with a Takata inflator sitting in the driveway,” said Rosekind. “We are checking weekly to see when those parts are going to be available.” The defect does not affect all the Takata inflators, but Rosekind urged consumers to try to find “loaner” cars where they could. Ordering companies to provide temporary replacements is beyond his remit. “I have looked at it every which way,” he said. “NHTSA has no authority to require loaners to be made available.” Part of the problem lies in creating a design for a new inflator that will not blow up. “Where we could push, we’ve pushed as quickly as we can with the caveat that we can’t push too hard without running the risk of a new design for an inflator that’s not safe,” Rosekind said. Stock in the Japanese manufacturer was down 9.25% on Wednesday, following news of the expanded recall. The problem now is that the models of car under recall are so numerous that the replacement of all dangerous parts is likely to take years. Rosekind said the recall was planned through 2019.",REAL
Cameron to propose global anti-corruption agency at summit,"An international anti-corruption body to help law enforcement agencies and investigators track down money laundering and tax evasion is to be one of the central proposals of next week’s anti-corruption summit hosted by David Cameron. The new international agency is likely to involve broadening the remit of the the Paris-based OECD, which is already undertaking work on bribery and international tax rules, Sir Eric Pickles, Cameron’s anti-corruption adviser, said. Pickles added that the body would not have law enforcement powers of its own, but would act as an information exchange for governments committed to fighting corruption. Cameron, facing claims that Britain has not done enough to clear up corruption in UK-administered tax havens, hopes the body will be a permanent institutional legacy of the summit, alongside a series of other commitments that countries attending the summit can adopt. Pickles disclosed that sports bodies including Fifa and Uefa would also sign a joint statement pledging to fighting corruption in sport. He said the statement would commit them to fighting bribery, gambling and drugs in an acknowledgement that the global integrity of sport was under question as never before. It will be the first time international sports bodies have come together to make such a statement. It is also likely that the summit will endorse greater transparency in public procurement, citing initiatives in eastern Europe, Colombia and Mexico. Cameron has invited all 20 member states within the G20, including Russia, Brazil and South Africa – three countries mired in corruption allegations. Russia will be represented by its deputy foreign minister, Oleg Syromolotov, while the US will be represented by its secretary of state, John Kerry. Kerry will probably come under pressure to do more to reform the tax secrecy surrounding states such as Delaware. As many as 40 countries are due to attend. The summit is regarded as Cameron’s major diplomatic initiative of the year, and will be followed by further summits in Paris and Japan later in the year, Pickles said. He said: “The Panama Papers has changed the climate. Those who come up with technical arguments about why change cannot be made, or say they need more time, are getting a lot less of a hearing. The public are impatient to see progress. The Panama Papers showed a lot of sons of presidents and relatives of presidents thought they could hide their people’s money abroad. Transparency is going to make that a lot more difficult.” He also gave his support to the proposal that all foreign companies purchasing properties in the UK be required to reveal the full beneficial ownership of the company purchasing the property. He said: “There is no reason why it should be possible to know the name of a UK property owner in the Land Registry, but not the name of a foreign owner. It will make it a lot easier to detect money laundering and will raise questions how a particular person managed to acquire the money to buy a property at No 3 Mayfair Towers.” The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has already issued a consultation on the proposed measure. Conservative MPs have also started to put pressure on the prime minister to set a deadline at the summit by which UK overseas territories must publish public beneficial ownership registers or face direct intervention by the UK government. The UK is publishing a public register of beneficial ownership in three weeks’ time, but overseas territories have insisted registers should only be open to law enforcement bodies and not the general public. Pickles defended the compromise: “I think there is a misunderstanding on this. It is a great leap forward that the overseas territories are going to make their registers open to law enforcement agencies such as the Serious Fraud Office on demand and the company involved will not know it is being investigated, and it will not be tipped off. “It has taken a long time to get the overseas territories this far, and there was no point in David Cameron waiting for perfection. The deal is not a roadblock. It is a huge leap forward.” Nigel Mills, the Conservative MP for Amber Valley and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on corruption, said on Tuesday he wanted the summit to back public registers. He said: “The important thing will be to get real commitments on beneficial ownership and a timeframe for the register to be transparent and public, so everyone can see who owns every company established in a jurisdiction”. Charities are calling for a deadline of 2017 to be set for the overseas territories. Mills was backed by the former chair of the public accounts committee Margaret Hodge, who said the summit needed to take action on the overseas territories or else it would be seen as a PR stunt. Robert Barrington from Transparency International said: “An innovative aspect of this summit is that it does not rely on consensus – government can sign up to the parts they are willing to deliver. “That means it should move beyond the usual platitudes, but it also means some of the more stretching deliverables might get very few signatures on the page. To be a success, each of the deliverables needs to have sufficient countries that there will be a critical mass.”",REAL
BHP Billiton faces legal spat in which all tactics are deemed fair,"It is ridiculous for the Brazilian independent prosecution service to argue that the damages for the disaster at Samarco, an iron ore operation owned by Vale and BHP Billiton, should be the same as those paid by BP after its Deepwater Horizon catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. There is no link between the two incidents. But the pointed reference to Deepwater Horizon in the 155bn real (£30bn) claim tells BHP and its local partner they now face a proper legal fight in which all tactics are deemed fair. The prosecutors’ aim is clearly to extract the maximum sum by whatever means. Indeed, there seems to be a secondary ambition of heaping embarrassment on the Brazilian government, which the independent prosecutors accuse of selling out in striking a settlement in March that observers estimated to be worth between 12bn and 20bn real. BHP’s shareholders seemed surprised by this turn of legal events – the share price fell 6% – but they should not have been. Brazilian politics is in crisis and the country’s president, Dilma Rousseff, is fighting for her survival. A dam disaster in which 19 people died, 700 people lost their homes and a tide of mud and residue ran 300 miles downstream to the mouth of the river Doce was always likely to acquire a deep political dimension. In that regard, a comparison can be made with Deepwater Horizon, where BP’s Britishness was hauled centre stage. The other similarity is that the case is bound to drag on for years, introducing fresh political risk for BHP and Vale if Rousseff falls. The eventual outcome probably won’t be the eye-catching £30bn demanded in the latest lawsuit. Equally, though, the $5bn (£3.4bn) or so in the government-sponsored settlement should now be seen as wishful thinking. Next’s finger-in-the-air exercise proves mildly reassuring Here is Next’s considered opinion on the current state of consumer demand, derived from an analysis of its own trading in the past six weeks: “Dunno, guv, we only sell clothes and stuff.” The firm’s chief executive, Lord Wolfson, didn’t put it like that, of course. Instead there was a worthy discourse on the effect of weather on recent weak sales - cold in March and April versus last year’s hot Easter - followed by a confession that the real problem may just be that consumers are spending less. Amid the uncertainty, Next reckons its sales this year could fall by 3.5%, but might rise by the same percentage. Put another way, pre-tax profits could decrease 8.9% to £748m or could improve 3.7% to £852m. It might seem odd that the market regarded this finger-in-the-air exercise as mildly reassuring - Next’s shares rose 3.5% - Ibut in a sense it is. Widening the range of possible profit outcomes to £104m - from £74m only two months ago - is unusual, but the key conclusion is surely that Next doesn’t expect to come apart at the seams, whatever happens. The low-end profit figure of £748m is hardly a disaster, even if it is correct that consumer confidence has turned down. In the long term, Next faces the problem of combating competitors who seem to have learned and copied its best distribution and logistics tricks. An upgrade is required for the online and catalogue Directory business, as Next admits. The short-term headaches, though, seem more irritating than painful. More reasons to be cheerful at Sainsbury’s Sainsbury’s relentless cheerfulness stands in contrast to Next’s default caution. The trouble is, the terrain looks fundamentally trickier for the supermarket chain. Yes, Sainsbury’s deserves plaudits for hanging onto its 16.5% share of the grocery market as its main rivals have stumbled. Yes, its chief executive, Mike Coupe, is on track to deliver every last penny of his three-year £500m cost-saving programme. And, if we’re being scrupulously fair, he may also be correct that the punters are crying to taste the “multi-product, multichannel shopping experience” that the purchase of Argos is intended to conjure. In the end, two financial statistics stand out from the full-year figures. First, underlying profits of £587m, down 14% on the year, were the lowest since 2009. Second, operating profit margins fell from 3% to 2.7%, meaning Sainsbury’s travelled away from its medium-term ambition of 3% to 3.5%. There’s nothing wrong with Coupe and co’s strategy – keep plugging away in food and experiment elsewhere – but the warning that “the market is competitive, and it will remain so for the foreseeable future” should be taken literally. Amazon is poised to try its luck in fresh food, which may be the trigger for Walmart to order its underlings at Asda to wake up. LSE and Deutsche love-in holds firm It’s the perennial bleat of the disappointed would-be bidder – we didn’t get enough “engagement” from the other side.

Let’s not waste time on overtures supposedly rebuffed. The rules of the takeover game are straightforward. If you wave a decent offer, your target is usually obliged to give you a hearing. Just don’t expect a red carpet. In the case of LSE/Deutsche, it was obvious from day one that the partners would be separated only by force.",REAL
Lawsuit aims to stop licensing of Texas immigration detention facilities,"Immigration activists are fighting back against a Texas decision to license immigration detention centres that critics call “baby jails”. A judge in Austin granted a temporary restraining order on Wednesday evening to stop the licensing, five days after the Texas department of family and protective services (DFPS) awarded a childcare licence to one of two federal family holding facilities near San Antonio. The second was set to receive its permit imminently. Judge Karin Crump will hear the case - brought by two detained mothers and Grassroots Leadership, an Austin-based group opposed to private prisons - on 13 May. The plaintiffs are seeking a temporary injunction to prevent Texas from implementing a new rule that enables the state agency to license the centres. Luis Zayas, a psychologist and social worker at the University of Texas who interviewed migrants in Karnes in 2014 called the new licences “an extraordinary manipulation of the rules of child welfare”. “Sure, they put up nice children’s playgrounds and things; it’s still a prison,” he said. There are classrooms, playgrounds and soccer fields, but the complexes in Dilley and Karnes are far from what most people would consider a child-friendly environment. In one public meeting held by the agency last December, a Japanese-American woman said that when she visited Dilley it reminded her of the time she spent in a second world war internment camp. “Stern, unfriendly guards led me and my fellow visitors through locked doors to the visitation room after requiring us to leave all our belongings, including art supplies and writing materials, in lockers outside,” said Satsuki Ina, a psychotherapist. “During my visit, I met with six families who had been held for varying lengths of time. Aside from the intense anxiety, depressed mood, and grief expressed by the mothers, I noticed significant signs of what I would consider captivity trauma of the children.” Dozens more lined up to argue that treating detention centres run by for-profit prison companies as childcare facilities would be a perversion of the state agency’s mission because it would help prop up an incarceration system that damages the physical and mental health of vulnerable women and children. Zayas, who found in 2014 that detention caused serious psychiatric disorders and development regression including reversion to breastfeeding, believes that as little as a couple of weeks in the facilities could have profound long-lasting effects on the mental health of both young and older children. These children may well have already experienced traumatic conditions in their home countries and on the way to the US, are anxious about whether they will be deported and “are witnessing their mothers be disempowered by the way they are treated”, he said. Yet the DFPS pressed on. The lawsuit argues that the DFPS is overstepping its authority by regulating places that are not, in reality, childcare establishments. Patrick Crimmins, a DFPS spokesman, said the agency is reviewing the suit and consulting with the state’s attorney general’s office. “By all reasonable measures, family detention camps are prisons. They are not childcare facilities,” Bob Libal, executive director of Grassroots Leadership, said in a statement. It is not the first time the group has taken legal action on the issue: It won a temporary injunction last November to stop the state from using an emergency rule to fast-track the licensing process without public comment. The DFPS had previously taken the position that regulating the centres was not within its purview. But last summer a judge in California, Dolly Gee, issued a stinging decision that lambasted the conditions inside the facilities. Gee ruled that detaining minors in unlicensed facilities for more than a couple of days violated a previous court settlement. The judgment appeared to threaten the future of the Obama administration’s controversial use of family detention, which it expanded amid the dramatic influx of unaccompanied minors in the summer of 2014. The expansion was hoped to act as a deterrent to thousands of Central Americans travelling north to seek asylum in the US and escape increased violence in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. While appealing Gee’s ruling, in an effort to show compliance and keep the centres open, the federal government began releasing families with pending asylum cases more quickly, allowing them to join up with relatives in the US. However, the problem of Dilley and Karnes lacking licences remained. Until, shortly before Gee’s deadline last October, the Texas agency suddenly developed an urge to regulate them – despite its already immensely stretched resources. The agency said that the case “highlighted a gap in the oversight of the children”. It argues that making Dilley and Karnes subject to its scrutiny will improve safety and quality of care and that taking a stance in the broader debate about whether to lock up migrants is not within its remit. A DFPS inspection of Karnes on 29 March found six deficiencies: cleaning carts left unattended; too little mulch in the playground; failure to clearly list a child’s allergies and chronic health conditions in a health file; failure to clearly state the right for a child not to be threatened with the loss of shelter as punishment; an employee not qualified for his or her position; a child found in a bedroom without his or her mother or a staff member present. Five of these issues had been verified as corrected on 22 April. The initial six-month licence was issued a week later and will be renewed if the facilities comply with minimum standards and deficiencies are corrected, Crimmins said. Karnes has a capacity of 580 people; Dilley, about 2,400. An inspection of Dilley on 6 April, when 459 children were in the facility, found 12 problems – from worn surfaces in the playgrounds and badly anchored soccer goals in the sports fields to medical supplies not being locked away, a child being made ill because his gluten allergy was ignored, expired fruit juice and inadequate staff training. The DFPS created a special rule for the centres which lowers its usual minimum standards for criteria such as room occupancy and sharing bedrooms with adults and children of the opposite gender. Critics say this underlines that the facilities are intrinsically unsuitable to be regulated as childcare buildings; the agency argues the changes help keep families together. “We’re not going to accept this as a final defeat in our attempt to end family detention,” said Jonathan Ryan, executive director of the legal aid organisation Raices. He said that in addition to seeking to hold the federal government accountable for conditions inside the centres, advocates would now also put pressure on Texas. “We call on the state of Texas to live up to this responsibility and properly enforce its jurisdiction over the care and custody of these children,” he said. Pablo Paez, corporate vice-president of the GEO Group, which runs Karnes, said in a statement: “The Karnes County Residential Center provides high quality care in a safe, clean, and family friendly environment, and onsite US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel provide direct oversight to ensure compliance with ICE’s Family Residential Standards. Our company has consistently, strongly denied allegations to the contrary.” He cited regular inspections and audits that have ensured compliance. Activists and attorneys have made complaints to the Department of Homeland Security which allege substandard mental and physical healthcare, including one case where a mother sought medical help for her two-year-old daughter on seven occasions before she was finally diagnosed with asthma. One woman from El Salvador who has been detained in Karnes for more than a month with her 12-year-old daughter described her experience in a complaint seen by the Guardian: “My daughter and I are not doing well in detention. We are both sad and we both cry. We feel like criminals. We cannot go anywhere without permission. “Guards walk through our bedroom at night every 15 to 30 minutes. This wakes us up and makes us feel afraid. We are rounded up and counted three times a day. We feel like prisoners,” she says. Last month a guard at the sole family immigration detention centre outside Texas, Berks County in Pennsylvania, admitted unlawful sexual relations with a detainee. Berks County remains open even though state officials said earlier this year they were revoking its licence to operate as a child residential facility.",REAL
Biologist tries to stop US from sending chimpanzees to private facilities abroad,"When Jen Feuerstein last saw Tara, she was only three. Feuerstein, a biologist, remembers the chimpanzee as “very playful and active”. Her aunt, Georgia, was “a beautiful, slender, dark female … who radiated intelligence and was very close to her family”. Thirteen years later, Feuerstein and a global group of plaintiffs are suing the US government to stop the transfer of Tara, Georgia, and six other chimpanzees that are no longer being used for research to a zoo across the Atlantic that has not received accreditation from major European or British zoo authorities, Wingham wildlife park, in Kent, England. Feuerstein and two other former researchers at Yerkes National Primate Research Center say the transfer will be detrimental to the chimpanzees’ health and won’t improve the chances of their species’ survival. Plaintiffs are concerned that transporting the eight chimpanzees in cages on an international flight and housing them in a zoo that has not housed chimpanzees before would “exacerbate the traumas they are already suffering as a result of the laboratory conditions and experimentation to which they have been exposed”, according to the complaint. The move would also set a dangerous precedent and violate the spirit of the Endangered Species Act, they say. “Export of the chimpanzees to an unaccredited zoo will not in any way enhance the survival of the species,” the complaint says. The case is the first time a private facility has sought a permit from the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to ship abroad chimpanzees that were formerly used for research, after the federal government listed captive chimpanzees as protected under the Endangered Species Act last year, and on the heels of a halt in federal funding for research on chimpanzees from the National Institutes of Health. Plaintiffs, which include the New England Anti-Vivisection Society (NEAVS), London-based Cruelty-Free International, and Canada’s Fauna Foundation, point to several decades of research and activism that has resulted in hundreds of formerly captive chimpanzees “retiring” from research and living healthier lives in accredited US sanctuaries – and note that several of these sanctuaries offered to take the chimps from Yerkes, which includes a price tag of up to $20,000 a year for their care. “I want them to have a great future,” said Feuerstein, who left Yerkes in 2003 and spent more than a decade working at Save the Chimps. “I don’t think that’s what’s being offered to them now.” Feuerstein said the trip alone would pose “unnecessary risks” to the psychological and physical health of the endangered animals, adding that transporting chimpanzees on transatlantic flights has been “extraordinarily unusual” since the federal government declared chimps in the wild as endangered in 1975. She noted that they can respond to anesthesia by vomiting and could choke on their own vomit if not accompanied by a trained person on the flight. In contrast, the biologist has supervised the transportation by ground of nearly 300 chimpanzees from former research facilities to sanctuaries and has seen “no fatalities or medical emergencies”. The complaint also warns that placing the chimpanzees at Wingham could “aggravate, rather than relieve, their psychological distress and aberrant behaviors”. Feuerstein said that chimpanzees held in captivity for research can exhibit behaviors similar to PTSD, including “self-abuse, rocking back and forth, and increased aggression”. These conditions “can be treated and alleviated”, she added – “with the help of specialized care, in sanctuaries”. Markus Wilder, animal collection curator for Wingham wildlife park, said in response: “It is incorrect that we have no previous experience with chimpanzees. We have animal care staff who have worked with chimpanzees, and our vet has extensive experience working with great apes.” Wilder also said Wingham has been licensed by the UK to operate as a zoo. Even as this lawsuit remains ongoing, the chimps could be shipped to London as early as this week, according to the complaint. “It will be terrifying,” Feuerstein said. “They’ve never undergone anything like that in their lives.” At least two US sanctuaries for chimpanzees “retired” from research have approached Yerkes about receiving the group, and NEAVS said it will pay for Georgia’s care at any sanctuary. The FWS wouldn’t comment on the case. A Yerkes spokeswoman, Lisa Newbern, sent press releases concerning the months-long case in an email, and wrote in a separate email that details about the offers from US sanctuaries were “confidential”. Theodora Capaldo, NEAVS president, was critical of another wrinkle in the case, in which Yerkes and Wingham offered to pay $45,000 a year for five years to the Population and Sustainability Network, which in exchange would protect chimpanzees in the wild. “The whole concept of allowing individual endangered species to be exported for commercial use by giving money to a third party that does conservation work is essentially allowing them to buy a permit,” Capaldo said. A review of communications between Tim Van Norman, charged with international permits for the FWS, and Joyce Cohen, associate director of animal resources at Yerkes, reveals that the federal agency suggested in an email that supporting the population network’s work might be “right up Yerkes’ path”. By the end of the month, Cohen wrote the federal agency of plans to make the donation as part of an “enhancement” to the research center’s application. In other words, the research center, with the federal agency’s help, had found a way to at least appear to satisfy the requirement for enhancing species survival. “What’s to stop groups from all over the world from trading in endangered species by donating a few thousand to conservation groups?” Capaldo said.",REAL
Scottish economy grows far more slowly than UK as a whole,"The Scottish economy is growing at a far slower rate than the UK as a whole, with the North Sea oil slump leading to a fall in GDP last year, the latest data shows. Scotland’s gross domestic product declined by 1% in cash terms last year and has only grown by 4% since the recession, an analysis by the economist John McLaren has found. By comparison, the UK economy as a whole has grown by 23% in cash terms since 2008. McLaren said the decline in North Sea oil profitability was largely to blame for the fall, but Scotland’s latest quarterly national accounts found that the country’s trade balance and tax revenues had also been badly hit, greatly weakening its public accounts. The quarterly accounts, published as voters prepare for the Scottish parliament elections, followed HM Revenue and Customs data last month showing that North Sea tax receipts had slumped last year to the negligible figure of £35m. “Scotland’s economy continues to show worrying signs of North Sea related distress. Due to falling oil revenues, overall Scottish public sector revenues were lower in 2015 than at the height of the downturn in 2008,” McLaren said. “There has also been a virtual standstill in GDP per capita since 2008, which has resulted in it falling below the level seen for the UK. The worsening trade position, largely with respect to the UK, is also a big worry, especially the fall in exports last year to the rest of the UK.” As a percentage of GDP, the trade deficit with the rest of the UK and overseas markets was now -9.8%, the worst figure since Scottish devolution in 1999 and worse than that previous low of -8.5% in 2007. Scotland’s deficit reached nearly £15bn in cash terms, McLaren found, largely the result of a surge in imports from the rest of the UK. At the same time, public sector revenues also fell for the fourth year in a row, by nearly 12% in real terms. Scottish public spending is currently £1,400 a head higher than the UK average. The latest government expenditure and revenue data for Scotland showed it had a public spending deficit in 2015 of £15bn. The Scottish National party said the data showed that even with the oil industry slump, Scotland’s per capita GDP was comparable to the UK average, at £28,385 against £28,634 for the UK. “Scotland remains the most prosperous part of the UK per head outside London and south-east England and is currently experiencing the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth since 2001,” a spokesman said. Scotland’s latest unemployment rates jumped above the UK average, adding to business nervousness, after a long period of relatively better figures. The SNP insisted the country’s economy was still strong, with among the highest levels of overseas investment in the UK. “We have regularly outperformed the rest of the UK when it comes to jobs, with recent months seeing employment levels at record highs while our female employment rate is among the highest in Europe,” the spokesman said.",REAL
Sainsbury's sales and profits fall amid price cuts,"Sainsbury’s has revealed a 14% drop in annual profits after it was forced to slash prices to compete with the rise of the discounters. Sales fell 1.1% to £25.8bn in the year to 12 March and underlying profits slid to £587m, higher than the £571m predicted by analysts, as the company said it had maintained market share in a “competitive, deflationary environment”. The retailer was boosted by an 8.5% rise in clothing sales and a near 9% rise in online sales, as well as more than 9% growth at its convenience stores as it opened 69 more Sainsbury’s Local outlets. In contrast, sales at supermarkets fell by 1.6%. Mike Coupe, the chief executive, said the supermarket was making good progress in a challenging market. Including one-off items such as property writedowns, Sainsbury’s returned to the black, booking a profit of £548m after a £72m loss last year. The company booked £101m in profits from the sale of property but also spent £59m on improving systems at its bank and £15m on costs relating to its planned acquisition of Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos. Income from suppliers, which Sainsbury’s revealed for the first time after pressure from regulators in the wake of the Tesco accounting scandal, slumped 42% to £371m as Sainsbury’s said it had slashed the number of supplier-funded promotions in favour of cutting prices. Improvements in the quality of some foods also helped Sainsbury’s hold its market share at 16.5% in the 12 weeks to 24 April compared with the same period a year before, according to the latest data from Kantar Worldpanel, as it outperformed major rivals. The supermarket’s sales were down 0.4%, the first fall this year, according to Kantar. But sales at Asda slumped 5.1%, while sales at Morrisons, which has sold off its convenience store chain, slipped by 2.6% and Tesco’s sales were down 1.3% over the period. In contrast, discounter Aldi increased sales by 12.5% and Lidl by 15.4%. Coupe said it was difficult to assess whether the Kantar figures presaged a broader consumer slowdown or whether shoppers were just reacting to an early Easter accompanied by colder and wetter weather. But he warned that shoppers would continue to buy fewer items in supermarkets and turn increasingly to convenience stores, online and discounters. “The UK food retail landscape is changing rapidly,” he said. “Retailing doesn’t stand still and we need to challenge the business to move with the time. That is quite a significant rationale in acquiring Argos.” Sainsbury’s is expecting to complete the £1.4bn takeover of Argos’s parent company, Home Retail Group, in the autumn but Coupe refused to be drawn on further details of his plans for the company. However, he said the acquisition would put Sainsbury’s “at the sweet spot of where customers are moving to”. Sainsbury’s said sales at established stores slid by 0.9% for the year, but trading has been on an improving trend with the supermarket revealing its first quarter of growth in more than two years in the final three months of its financial year. Coupe said: “It remains a challenging market. We are expecting deflation to continue through the summer and clearly that has a significant impact on our sales line.” He added that Sainsbury’s would continue to cut prices to remain competitive. Overall prices in the grocery market had fallen by 4% over the past two years and he said falls in commodity prices and strong competition meant deflation could continue throughout this year. Coupe said shoppers had more money in their pockets to spend but were tending to spend it outside traditional retail – on holidays and new cars. Despite that shift, Sainsbury’s is planning to open five new supermarkets and up to 50 convenience stores this year, compared with a net four supermarkets and 66 convenience stores last year. It will also refurbish 25 supermarkets after just seven refurbishments last year where it trialled new ideas such as expanded takeaway areas. Shares dived more than 6% to 267.8p, despite better than expected profits, as analysts expressed concern that the business’s profit margins and sales continue to fall. Operating profits slid to 2.74% from 3.07% in the previous year – taking them in the opposite direction to Sainsbury’s target of 3% to 3.5% by 2019 at the latest. Dave McCarthy, an analyst at HSBC, said: “Life is only going to get tougher, at a time when management is likely to be distracted by the planned Argos acquisition.” Meanwhile, Sainsbury’s is to offer mortgages from next year as it hopes its bank will deliver growth which is difficult to find in the grocery aisles. John Rogers, the supermarket’s finance director, said customers expected Sainsbury’s to offer mortgages alongside its current products which include insurance, savings accounts and credit cards. “We know from research that customers really trust the Sainsbury’s Bank brand and from a customer perspective makes a lot of sense. He said mortgage lending would be underpinned by a combination of customer deposits held by the bank and borrowing in the wholesale market and the mortgages would help balance risk. Coupe said expanding Sainsbury’s bank was part of the retailer’s three year plan to invest in growing markets such as online, convenience stores and services. In the year to March 2015 underlying profit rose 17%. However, the cost of taking over systems from the bank’s former co-owner Lloyds Banking Group and a cut in the interchange fees charged to retailers by banks have hit profits growth since then. Underlying operating profit rose 4.8% in the past year and Sainsbury’s said the launch of mortgages will mean a 10% fall in underlying operating profit in the year ahead.",REAL
Questions for the Women’s Equality party,"When I heard about the Women’s Equality party from the irrepressibly ebullient Sandi Toksvig I was intrigued. It emphatically wants to address the gender pay gap which would solve many of the world’s economic and social ills. Although affordable childcare (free for the first nine months) will enable women to work, many are compelled to take part-time jobs or short-term contracts with barely any rights and poor pay. How will the party address this? It talks of parental leave of six weeks – but some mothers take a career break, opting to stay at home with their baby, and then find it daunting to get back into work. How will WEP support these women? Even if fathers take their two weeks’ paternity leave, this does not constitute equal parenting. What about mothers who suffer maternal mental illness? Suicide is the primary indirect cause of maternal death in the UK. What is its mental health policy stance? Encouraging girls to go into science is positive, but encouraging girls from poor and ethnically diverse backgrounds to go into the arts, film, TV and broadcasting is equally important. The dearth of representation means this realm is increasingly becoming the preserve of those with affluent parents. If more ethnically diverse women were represented, it would contribute to a richer cultural landscape. The WEP must campaign for a wider range of policies representing women from varying socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds. Otherwise it could end up being a failed white middle-class feminist experiment. Sanchita Islam London • Sitting on the train travelling from Wiltshire to London, I read that the actress Emma Thompson is backing the Women’s Equality party and that this is largely because she believes WEP is “putting issues of caring – for children and for the elderly – at the top of its agenda” (Why I’m voting Women’s Equality, Letters, 3 May). I am confused. I have seen no evidence of WEP policy proposals to treat caregivers equally, or to properly support families with care responsibilities, but I hope I am wrong. I often attend meetings about caregiving, and also volunteer for a family counselling charity. Adults engaged in care work, women and men, contribute hugely in ways that can’t always be easily counted. This matters for children, teenagers and the elderly, as well as people experiencing poor mental or physical health. The Office for National Statistics values this work at £343bn. But there’s an urgent need for policies that address the current hefty penalty against time spent caring for family members. Encouraging a move away from family care towards care in the paid economy, so it counts in GDP, isn’t quite the same as supporting unpaid loving care, caring and caregiving. Care work is equal work and it’s time it wasn’t treated like a second class activity by policymakers in all parties. If WEP has new ideas I would be interested to hear about them. Marie Peacock Salisbury, Wiltshire • I too would be shocked if it were true that 85% of young women in London are sexually harassed every day. The actual YouGov figure was based on a sample of 96 young people (18-24), both male and female, only a small proportion of whom were Londoners: 52% said they had suffered unwanted attention of a sexual nature in the last 12 months, and another 33% some time earlier. Nothing to be proud of, but not quite the outrageous level of harassment suggested by your correspondent.

Trump doubles down on critiques of Clinton after Indiana primary win,"Fresh off an overwhelming victory in Indiana that made him the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump wasted little time in previewing his tactics against Hillary Clinton in a general election. Trump has spent the last year batting away his Republican opponents, largely by turning them into caricatures. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush was “low-energy”, Florida senator Marco Rubio was “Little Marco” and Texas senator Ted Cruz, who suspended his campaign on Tuesday, “Lyin’ Ted”. Former secretary of state Clinton will be known as “Crooked Hillary”. During an interview with MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Wednesday, Trump attached several other labels to his likely opponent. She was “unqualified”, he said, and “should suffer” for her use of a private email server while in office. The system was “rigged” in her favor. “She should not be allowed to run in the election,” Trump said. “She should suffer like other people have suffered who have done far less than she has … and here she is running for president like nothing happened.” The former reality TV star invoked comments last month by the other remaining Democratic candidate, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, that Clinton was “unqualified” to be president. “Bernie Sanders said she’s got poor judgment,” Trump said. Sanders made his remarks as tensions escalated before the 19 April primary in New York. The senator later walked back his statement, but not before it had been seized upon by Republicans. The challenge for those Republicans, though, remains that as far as Trump is concerned, nothing is off limits – even if it risks turning off large swaths of voters. The real estate mogul has already dug up Clinton’s past: earlier this year, dredging up the Monica Lewinsky scandal, he likened former president Bill Clinton to a sexual predator. Also, last week, he handed Clinton a rallying cry by saying she was playing “the woman card” and had little else to offer than her gender. Clinton’s team responded with a full-scale “woman card” fundraising drive that raised $2.4m in three days, 40% of which her campaign said came from first-time donors. Such moments offer Clinton a chance to appeal to Republicans frustrated by what they view as the breakdown of their party. Some GOP strategists in Washington were willing to declare their support for Clinton as early as Tuesday, when it became apparent that Trump would win Indiana and all but end the prospect of a contested convention in July. The Clinton campaign on Wednesday circulated a list featuring some of them, as well as quotes from other Republican lawmakers and prominent conservatives who said they would never back Trump. To further its case that Trump is unpalatable to his own party, Team Clinton released a new web video in the afternoon compiling footage of Trump’s former Republican opponents attacking him on the stump and in interviews. Featured in the video are Cruz referring to Trump as “utterly immoral”; Florida senator Marco Rubio blasting him as a “con artist” and “the most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency”; former Florida governor Jeb Bush saying “he needs therapy”; and multiple clips from an anti-Trump speech delivered earlier this year by 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Although Clinton has long made it a staple of her stump speeches to condemn Trump as a demagogue, in particular regarding his anti-immigration and anti-Muslim rhetoric, it was only last week that her campaign began to pivot toward the general election in earnest. The campaign named state directors in key battleground states, seeking to turn its attention to a ground operation geared for the general election – a critical area in which Trump may lag behind. And while Clinton has continued to campaign in primary states, she made a stop on Tuesday in the must-win general election state of Ohio, to pitch her economic agenda. Many working-class white voters in the so-called Rust Belt have been drawn to the populist appeal of both Sanders and Trump. During his victory speech on Tuesday, echoing once more an attack used by Sanders, Trump launched into a critique of Clinton’s record on trade by tying her to Bill Clinton’s landmark North American Free Trade Agreement. To win back the White House, Republicans will nonetheless need to secure more than a majority of white voters. With a nominee whose unfavorability ratings position him as the least-popular nominee of either party in modern history, and whose primary campaign has alienated nearly every other demographic in the country, that will remain an uphill climb.",REAL
El Salvador arrests negotiators of gang truce in new get-tough policy,"It was heralded as a bold attempt to curb decades of violence and credited with slashing El Salvador’s murder rate by half. But four years after a truce was declared between the country’s two main gang factions, the controversial ceasefire has been recast as a criminal conspiracy – and its protagonists arrested as gang sympathisers. Sixteen people have been detained in a series of high-profile raids, as authorities used new legislation outlawing dialogue with gang members to justify the arrests. Psychologists, teachers, senior police officers and prison wardens were among those detained for their role in negotiating the 2012 truce between the powerful Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Calle 18 gangs. The most prominent figure caught in the roundup was Raúl Mijango, a former leftwing guerrilla who fought alongside members of the current FMLN (Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front) government in the 12-year civil war. Mijango, who was part of the team which negotiated the truce on behalf of the previous FMLN government, is accused of illicit association and trafficking of illicit goods. The arrests come as the government of President Salvador Sánchez Cerén rolls out a new mano dura – or iron fist – security plan which authorities hope will stem the killing by forcing the gangs into submission. The nominally leftwing government is hastily planning makeshift prisons to cope with projected mass arrests and has tacitly authorised the military and police to adopt a “shoot to kill” policy toward suspected gang members. “Those thinking about a new truce should not do so. We will not allow this to happen,” the chief prosecutor said on Tuesday. The arrests were hailed by the majority of citizens and the mainstream media, who squarely blame MS-13 and Calle 18 for the bloodletting which has devastated the tiny Central American country. The violence has steadily escalated since the truce started to collapse in 2013; last year was the bloodiest since the war ended in 1992, which left El Salvador ranked as the most violent country in the world. But leading experts condemned the arrests as politically motivated and warned of potentially dire consequences. Adam Blackwell, the former representative of the Organisation of American States (OAS) who helped facilitate the negotiations, said: “This is a vindictive sacrificing of the lambs – most of the 18 people arrested are decent public servants. Truce or no truce, the authorities need a communications channel. Are they going to arrest the Red Cross who are working in the prisons as well?” Half of those arrested held low-level administrative positions. Yet senior negotiators such as bishop Fabio Colindres and the current defence minister, Gen David Munguía Payés, were not detained. The FMLN first came to power in 2009 amid promises to use crime prevention and social programmes to tackle the escalating crime rates, which they inherited from the rightwing National Republican Alliance (Arena). In early 2012, government officials and Catholic church representatives brought together rival gang leaders who agreed to stop killings and reprisal homicides. The murder rate immediately fell by a half. But the truce was meant to be the first part of a negotiated peace process. The ceasefire should have been followed by improvements in the inhumane, overcrowded prisons and the introduction of prevention and reinsertion programmes within marginalised communities. This never happened. Former president Mauricio Funes was unable to persuade international lenders to help, and private donors were prevented from funding programmes after the US declared MS-13 a terrorist group. By the middle of 2014, the truce had collapsed. Last year, almost 6,700 people were murdered, including an average of 30 a day in August. “It’s a miracle it [the truce] lasted so long,” said Blackwell. “Yes, we worked with people who’d done some terrible things, but it was never a quid pro quo situation. We weren’t trying to go to heaven, just trying to avoid going to hell.” An academic gang expert, speaking anonymously because of the threat to criminalise those working with gangs, told the Guardian: “At the height of the truce, the homicide rate was five per day; now it’s 25. You don’t just walk away from that type of reduction – you bow out because you have nothing to offer the gangs as there is just no money for prevention and reinsertion programmes, and mano dura is not only popular, it’s cheaper.” The truce was controversial from the start, in part because the dialogue and subsequent deal were clouded in secrecy. Fragile public support nosedived amid rumours that the truce strengthened and enriched loathed gang leaders. Public disapproval increased further after unsubstantiated claims that while murders had decreased, disappearances increased after the ceasefire. Paolo Luers, another of the principal negotiators, who was not indicted yesterday but is under investigation, said blaming the truce for the country’s violence has widespread public and political support. “I’ve never concealed my participation in meetings with mediators and gang members, but crimes were never planned. These meetings were used to discuss possibilities for preventing crimes,” Luers said. “What worries me most is how the gang members will react, as now there is no way to talk to them in order to prevent madness.”",REAL
Barclays to sell off more than 100m shares in Africa subsidiaries,"Barclays has kickstarted the sale of parts of its African operations, eyed by its former chief executive Bob Diamond. In a sale that could raise £750m for the bank, Barclays announced it was placing 103.6m shares – or around a 12.2% stake – in Barclays Africa with institutional investors. Barclays wants to reduce its 62.5% share in Barclays Africa, which is listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange, to below 20%. Diamond is part of a consortium that is trying to bid for the operation. Last month, Diamond said the “consortium has committed long-term strategic investors. The funding is in place. There is support for this potential transaction”. Diamond was speaking in a presentation to investors in the London-listed African-based bank Atlas Mara, which he formed after being forced out of Barclays in the wake of the Libor-rigging crisis in 2012. Barclays said Public Investment Corporation, a South African state pension fund which already has a more than 5% stake in the African business, was acting as an anchor investor in the share placing. The sell down leaves Barclays with an influential 50.1% stake in Barclays Africa. While the selloff could be seen a blow to Diamond’s ambitions, the sale had been anticipated by the market. Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays since the start of December, said the sale was “an important first step as we seek to reduce our shareholding in Barclays Africa to a level that achieves accounting and regulatory deconsolidation”. In March, when he presented first quarter results, Staley had announced the plan to pull back in Africa and cut the dividend this year and next. “As we said at our first quarter results, we continue to explore opportunities to reduce our shareholding, including capital market and strategic options. “Barclays Africa is an important partner, and we are working closely with local management, including planning for the operational separation of the two businesses in a way that will preserve value for shareholders in both the Barclays and Barclays Africa groups.” Bloomberg had earlier quoted the national regulator expressing concern about the nature of the bid. “As a regulator we won’t be comfortable with a private equity play for any of the banks,” the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, Kuben Naidoo, said.",REAL
How loyal are you to your loyalty cards?,"If you have a wallet, chances are there’s at least one loyalty card stashed in there, be it a dog-eared coffee stamp card or a Boots Advantage card. But with many major shops and supermarkets cutting back on their perks – Tesco is scrapping its Clubcard Boost events and Nectar has halved the value of points you receive for shopping at Sainsbury’s – loyalty schemes are becoming increasingly worthless. So, does anyone still use them? We took to the streets to find out. Sandra Pihlak, 27, student I’ve never had any loyalty cards, but a lot of my friends do. They take up way too much space in your wallet and are just another ploy to get you hooked on buying things you don’t need. Laura Butler, 27, physiotherapist I’ve got loads, from a Nectar card and Boots to Mac and a few other ones from places I don’t even shop at. My Nectar card sometimes knocks some money off, but not much. The rest I hardly ever use. It’s very easy to sign up for loyalty schemes, so I’m a sucker for them. My wallet probably needs cleaning out. Laurence Johnson, 43, engineer I have a Tesco Clubcard, but it has rarely been useful. The only points scheme that seems to pay off is Avios air miles. Most others turn out to be useless. Carlos Ferreira, 32, receptionist I don’t have any loyalty cards because I don’t think it’s worth it. More often than not it’s to scam you into shopping more and it’s just not worth the effort. I have a friend with a Boots card who spends more than he should just to get points on his card. Anabelle Smith, 40, solicitor I have a lot of cards – Nectar, House of Fraser, Body Shop, Superdrug. None of them really pay off, apart from the Boots Advantage and Marks &amp; Spencer cards, which have decent points systems. With most other schemes, I find it takes forever to accrue anything of value, but I can see why people sign up to them. Catherine Clark, 78, teacher In the past, I used a Nectar card occasionally to buy nappies for my grandchildren. I received a lot of junk mail and useless vouchers, which was annoying. I also didn’t like the idea of my shopping habits being observed, so I cancelled it. I much prefer to shop from independent shops. Charlotte Russell 33, clinical trials manager I have so many – Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Tesco, John Lewis, Holland &amp; Barrett, Boots and Superdrug. Some are pretty good, but the rest just weigh down your wallet and result in loads of junk mail. I figured I might as well sign up; you never know when you might need them. I have friends in the US who are savvy with coupons, but it just doesn’t work like that over here with loyalty cards. Rachel Dunn, 28, housing association officer I have a Nectar card and I get some money off my Sainsburys shop but very rarely. At Boots, it took me years to collect £20-worth of points. It takes a long time to benefit from any of these schemes. Hannah Newell, 28, facilities manager I have tonnes of cards, but the only ones I use are Boots and Waitrose. I used to work in Argos, and people would come in with hundreds of pounds-worth of Nectar points to spend – I have no idea how.",REAL
EU referendum: Cameron gives evidence to liaison committee - Politics live,"David Cameron has given his bluntest assessment yet of the chances of Turkey joining the European Union, saying it will not happen “for decades”. Giving evidence to the Commons liaison committee, he said: I don’t think the accession of Turkey to the European Union is remotely on the cards. I don’t think it will happen for decades. I think if you look at the facts, the facts are it requires unanimity of all European members. The French, for instance, have said they would have a referendum on it. So I would say very clearly to people, if your vote in this referendum is being influenced by considerations about Turkish membership of the EU, don’t think about it. It is not remotely on the cards. It’s not an issue in this referendum. His comments are in marked contrast to what he said when he gave a speech in Turkey in 2010 and told his audience: “I will remain your strongest possible advocate for EU membership.” (See 5.53pm.) Cameron has been warned to “expect a writ” if the government refuses to take down its web posts supporting the case for Britain to remain in the European Union. The Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin told him during the hearing it would be illegal to keep pages on the Gov.uk website up during the so-called purdah period in the last few weeks of the campaign. Cameron said the government was taking legal advice, but that calls for websites to be taken down wre an “extreme position”. Jenkin said legal precedent meant the government could not keep up the websites up. He told Cameron: “Expect a letter before action. If we can raise the funds, expect a writ.” The Crown Prosecution Service has said that police forces may go to court to ensure time limits don’t stop possible prosecution of the Tories for breaking election expenses laws. (See 4.56pm.) Alex Salmond, Scotland’s former first minister, has said the election of Boris Johnson as prime minister could be the “material change of circumstances” that would justify another independence referendum. Speaking on LBC he said: I have had a number of conversations with Boris Johnson, and one or two of them have been reasonably lucid. Boris, as he used to say, wanted to if not abolish the Scottish Parliament then to severely restrict its powers, if I remember him correctly. I mean, that might well be a change in material circumstances, who knows? That’s all from me for today. I won’t be blogging during the day tomorrow - a colleague will be here instead - but I will be covering the election results as they come in overnight in an results blog going up tomorrow night. Q: Why do you think the UK should remain in the EU? Cameron says a hard-headed calculation of what is best for the country shows we are better off remaining in. But there is a big argument about Britain too. Being in the EU enhances the UK’s power, he says. Q: And how do you answer Michael Gove’s most powerful point, that slowly our national identity is being eroded. Cameron says he does not feel any less Britain being part of the European Union. There is a big, bold British case to make, he says. Tyrie ends by saying Cameron has been “pretty clear” and that he has given some “direct answers”. And that is it. The hearing is over. I will post a summary soon. Andrew Tyrie goes next. He says some months ago he proposed to Cameron a plan to reverse the EU ratchet of regulation. Tyrie then published a pamphlet on this. And Cameron became more interested. There are elements of the idea in the EU renegotiation, Tyrie says. But Tyrie says there is a problem; the European Commission will be the one in charge of reviewing regulation. Cameron says, if you want a bureaucracy to deregulate, you have to get the bureaucracy to do it. It is no good getting an outside body to do it, he says. He says this commission is unlike previous ones. It contains strong, pro-business, Atlanticist free traders in it, he says. Meg Hillier goes next. Q: Can you be a bit more precise about what will be done to improve agricultural payments to farmers? Cameron says the government is making progress. The EU’s court of auditors has recognised the UK’s good practice. The Mirror’s Jason Beattie points out that Cameron has changed his tune on Turkey joining the EU over the last six years. The quote is from this speech that Cameron gave in Ankara in 2010, shortly after he became prime minister. Here is a fuller extract. I am here to make the case for Turkey’s membership of the European Union and to fight for it. Do you know who said this? ‘Here is a country which is not European, its history, its geography, its economy, its agriculture and the character of its people - admirable people though they are - all point in a different direction. This is a country which cannot, despite what it claims and perhaps even what it believes, be a full member.’ Now, that might sound like some Europeans describing Turkey. Actually it was General de Gaulle describing the United Kingdom, my country, before vetoing our accession to the European Union. So we know what it is like to be shut out of the club, but we also know that these things can change. When I think about what Turkey has done to defend Europe as a NATO ally and what Turkey is doing today in Afghanistan alongside our European allies, it makes me angry that your progress towards EU membership can be frustrated in the way that it has been. My view is clear: I believe it is just wrong to say that Turkey can guard the camp but not be allowed to sit in the tent. I will remain your strongest possible advocate for EU membership and for greater influence at the top table of European diplomacy. This is something I feel very strongly and very passionately about. Together I want us to pave the road from Ankara to Brussels. Cameron says he does not think the accession of Turkey is “remotely on the cards”. He says it will not happen “for decades”. All EU member states would have a veto, he says. Cameron says Turkey will not join the EU “for decades”. Labour’s Frank Field goes next. Q: Do you think you will be able to stay on as prime minister if the UK votes to leave the EU? Yes, says Cameron. He tells Field to remember he won an election just last year. Labour’s Keith Vaz goes next. Q: There are more than 2,000 EU nations in prisons. Should we have done more to deport them? And, if we leave, will it get easier or harder to get rid of them? Cameron agrees that the government should have done more. But, if we leave the EU, it will get “harder” to send prisoners back. Cameron says returning EU prisoners to their home countries will get “harder” if the UK votes to leave. Q: Do you wish you had never thought up the referendum, given the damage it is doing to your party? No, says Cameron. He says he believes in democracy. He could have avoided the risk with a referendum on Scotland. But he did not do that. And it’s the same with the EU. Q: Do you think Project Fear tactics work? Cameron says he does not accept that there are exaggerated stories. Q: What about 100,000 jobs lost in the City? Cameron says that is what the head of the stock exchange told him would happen in the event of Brexit. Q: Is Theresa May wrong to say that, if the UK votes to leave the EU, there will be another independence referendum in Scotland? Cameron says we are one United Kingdom, and we take decisions as one United Kingdom. The SNP’s Pete Wishart says the Scots did not want a referendum. They did not vote for parties that proposed one. So what is Cameron’s message to Scots if the UK votes to leave? Cameron says the opinion polls show there is very little difference in support from a referendum between Scotland and the rest of the UK. So looking at election results is not a good way of gauging support for a referendum, he says. Q: Len McCluskely, the Unite general secretary, says the government backed down over the trade union bill to get the unions to back the pro-EU campaign. [Jenkin is referring to my colleague Rajeev Syal’s story.] Cameron says the two issues were not related. The government needed to back down because it lost in the Lords. Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative, goes next. He says he has given Cameron notice of this question. Q: The government says it plans to keep its pro-EU websites up during the purdah period (the pre-election period when the government is supposed to be neutral). But I’ve been told this is against the law. Cameron says the government will abide by the law. It will take legal advice too. He says he accepts the need not to update a website during purdah. But he is not convinced that it is necessary to take the website down. Jenkin says his legal advice is that leaving a notice up amounts to publication. If the government does not change its mind, there will be legal action. Cameron jokes about needing to get back to the office then to deal with this. Tory MP Bernard Jenkin says government will be taken to court if it tries to leave pro-EU websites up during the referendum purdah. Back to the committee, and here is a highlight of the last few minutes. The CPS say it is up to the police to decide whether or not they will go to court to apply for the time limit rules to be overturned in relation to alleged election overspending. The CPS has offered to help forces with “investigative advice” if that is needed. To recap: under the Representation of the People Act (RPA) 1983 anyone accused of breaking election expenses law can only be prosecuted within a year of the offence being committed, unless an application it made to the courts for an extension, which is allowed under the Act. Several police forces will be involved. The Electoral Commission is investigation serious allegations made by Channel 4 News about possible Tory overspending, relating to three byelections at the end of the last parliament (Newark, Clacton and Rochester and Strood) and contests in 29 constituencies at the general election. The Crown Prosecution Service has put out a statement about today’s meeting with the Electoral Commission. (See 10.32am.) Here it is in full. Following a constructive meeting with the police and Electoral Commission, it has been agreed that each relevant police force will consider what action to take. This may include making an application to the court under s.176 of the Representations of the People Act 1983 to extend the time allowed to bring a prosecution. This is significant. Here’s what it means. Police forces may go to court to ensure time limits don’t stop possible prosecution of the Tories for breaking election expenses laws, the CPS says. Labour’s Meg Hillier goes next. Q: The incompetence of your government is putting the pro-Europe case at risk. Payments for farmers have not been processed properly. Cameron says he accepts that the government needs to manage these payments more effectively. Cameron says Sir Bill Cash always wanted the UK to have some sort of associate membership of the EU. But that option was not available, he says. He says Cash argued in the 1990s that the UK opt-out on the single currency would not work. But it has worked. And the Danish opt-out worked for them. Cameron is now being questioned by Bill Cash. Cameron says he does not want to “over-emphasis the achievement of his [EU] renegotiation”. Cameron says he does not want to “over-emphasis the achievement of his [EU] renegotiation”. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, goes first. Q: Were you serious when you suggested that you might recommend leaving the EU if you did not get your way in the renegotiation? Cameron says he has never advocated leaving the EU. Q: But if you had not got a renegotiation, would you be now advocating leaving? Cameron says that is a hypothetical question. He never wanted the British people to have to answer that question. Q: I’m trying to find out if you are recommending that Britain stays on the basis of the renegotiation. Cameron says some people would want to leave whatever happened. He wants to stay in the EU on the basis of what he has renegotiated. Q: If the choice was staying in the EU as it is now, what would you recommend? Cameron says he is advising people to stay in the EU on the basis of what he has renegotiated. He says it is “an additional reasons to stay”. It has addressed concerns people had real worries about. David Cameron is about to give evidence to the Commons liaison committee (the one made up of the chairs of all Common select committees) about the EU referendum. Tim Farron, the leader of the Lib Dems, has also welcomed the government’s child refugee U-turn. But he says the government will have to take at least 1,000 children to make it meaningful. In a statement he said: Since I first raised the issue with him last October, the prime minister has done everything he can to ignore the plight of unaccompanied child refugees in Europe, so I strongly welcome the announcement that we will finally be helping these vulnerable kids. 90,000 unaccompanied children arrived in Europe last year, so 3,000 is the very least Britain can do. I will do everything I can to ensure that the government meets this target. What started as a call supported only by the Lib Dems has developed into a truly cross party campaign, and those activists up and down the country who have championed this should be proud of their efforts today. The detail remains to be seen. Tens or hundreds simply won’t be good enough and would be a betrayal of the British public and parliament. This is a victory, but it’s not the end of the story. The government must also ensure that local authorities are properly funded so that they can help these traumatised children rebuild their lives and achieve their full potential. UPDATE: In his statement Farron says fewer than 1,000 refugees “won’t be good enough” but a Lib Dem spokesman says the party actually wants the government to take 3,000. Many of you are interested in the meeting between the Electoral Commission and the Crown Prosecution Service about extending legal time-limits to allow a possible prosecution in relation to the allegations about the Tories breaking rules on election spending. (See 10.32am.) The meeting took place earlier. The commission aren’t saying anything about it, but the CPS say they are due to issue a statement later this afternoon. I’ll post it when I get it. If you are voting tomorrow and you need information before you decide who to back, do take a look at Democratic Dashboard. It is an online tool set up by Democratic Audit at the LSE that is intended to provide all the relevant information about candidates and past election results that you need. Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour’s refugee task force, has described the government child refugee U-turn (see 2.13pm) as “a major change”. In a statement she said: Now we have seen more detail on the government’s announcement, it’s clear this is a major change in principle in the space of a week and that is huge tribute to everyone who has campaigned so hard on this. I strongly welcome this major change in principle. Now we need to make sure it turns into practice and that enough places are provided. For the first time, the government has accepted that Britain should do its bit and help child refugees who are at risk within Europe - having refused even a week ago to countenance this. And they are accepting the Dubs amendment that the Prime Minister rejected last week. This has only happened because of the huge strength of feeling that Britain should help children sleeping rough, at risk of harm and prostitution, meaning ministers realised they would have lost the vote. It shows that cross party campaigning can make a real difference. However the government hasn’t said how many children will be helped and hasn’t said whether this will be close to the 3000 places we originally called for. So we will keep up the campaign to make sure it delivers in practice. Sadiq Khan, Labour’s candidate for London mayor, has told London Live TV that he will use his second preference vote in the mayoral contest to vote for the Women’s Equality party. He said: I’m a big fan of the Women’s Equality party. I say this in a non-patronising way, I’ve got two daughters and what’s unacceptable in 2016 is your gender can define the job you can get, it can define how safe you are and can define the pay you get. It will be a completely redundant vote - assuming his first vote is for himself, Khan’s second preference won’t come into play - but it is nevertheless a notable quasi-endorsement. Nigel Farage is campaigning in Lincolshshire today. Apart from a few seats on Lincoln city council the only other election being held in the county is for the police and crome commissioner. There are serious fears that the turnout will be so low that Ukip could have their first PCC with control over the police force. Their candidate is a Victoria Ayling whose views on sending home all immigrants were too much even for the Daily Mail. Save the Children has warmly welcomed the government’s announcement about child refugees. In a statement Tanya Steele, its chief executive, said: The UK government has today matched the great leadership they have shown in providing aid and support to Syrian refugees in the region by reaching out a hand to children already on European shores. This announcement echoes Britain’s proud history of offering safety at times of great crisis and we want to thank the members of parliament who have led the way in championing this cause, as well as the British public who have opened their hearts to refugee children. David Cameron has said his government will not stand in the way of an amendment by a Labour peer that paves the way for the UK to provide homes to unaccompanied refugee children who have already arrived in Europe. Cameron made the comment at PMQs, and Number 10 has susbsequently confirmed in a statement that the UK will take an unspecified number of child refugees who registered in Greece, Italy or France before 20 March. (See 2.13pm.) David Cameron has described Labour as a party that puts “extremists over working people” during PMQs exchanges which saw him repeatedly criticise Jeremy Corbyn for once describing Hamas and Hezbollah as “friends”. Cameron quoted what Corbyn said as a backbench MP, when he said he had invited “our friends” from Hamas and Hezbollah to speak at an event. Cameron went on: [Corbyn] referred to Hamas and Hezbollah as his friends. He needs to withdraw that remark ... Are they your friends or are they not? Because these organisations in their constitutions believe in persecuting and killing Jews. They are anti-Semitic organisations, they are racist organisations. He must stand up and say they are not his friends. Corbyn did not explicitly retract the comment, but he told Cameron: Obviously, anyone who commits racist acts or is anti-Semitic is not a friend of mine. I am very clear about that ... I absolutely do not approve of those organisations. Cameron has said the Iraq inquiry report will come out “not too much longer” after the EU referendum on 23 June. It has always been expected to come out around then, but the government has until now never explicitly ruled out it being published before the referendum. Downing Street has said Cameron has “no intention” of withdrawing his condemnation of comments by US presidential hopeful Donald Trump as “divisive, stupid and wrong”. As the Press Association reports, an adviser to Trump has said Cameron apologise to Trump, after the withdrawal of main rival Ted Cruz made him all but certain of securing the Republican nomination. Cameron criticised Trump last December, saying Trump’s call for a ban on Muslims entering the US was “divisive, stupid and wrong”. George Papadopoulos, an adviser to Trump, said Cameron’s comments were “uncalled-for” and it would be “wise” for the prime minister to “reach out in a more positive manner” to the Republican front-runner. Asked about Papadopoulos’s comments, Cameron’s official spokeswoman said: The prime minister has no intention of withdrawing his comments, which were made in response to comments that Donald Trump made calling for a ban on Muslims entering the US. That was the context for the PM’s comments. Britain’s chief rabbi has claimed that Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour has a severe problem with antisemitism and warned that the party must not resort to political posturing and empty promises. Two more Labour councillors have been suspended over allegations of anti-Semitism, the party has said. Miqdad Al-Nuaimi, a councillor in Newport, south Wales, and Terry Kelly, who sits on Renfrewshire Council, have been suspended “pending an investigation”, a spokesman said. Cameron has declined to appear before a parliamentary committee to give evidence to its inquiry into Libya, citing diary pressures. He told the foreign affairs committee that Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, has already given evidence to it on behalf of the government. Amnesty International has accused the first minister of Northern Ireland, Arlene Foster, of delaying justice by blocking funds for a series of inquests into Troubles-related killings. Cameron has revealed, in an interview with First News, the children’s newspaper, that he bans his children from playing with electronic devices on Saturday mornings. After the interview Alex Garcia-Ghuran, from Hertfordshire, said: We learned from Mr Cameron that his children do not get to play with any electronic devices on Saturday morning and he will get upset if he catches them breaking the rule. That sounded like my dad. There was some confusion after PMQs about Jeremy Corbyn’s statement on Tuesday that: “We are not going to lose seats, we are looking to gain seats where we can.” Asked whether he really meant this, an aide to the leader said Corbyn may have been “slightly misinterpreted”, adding that “what he said was that he said he would make no predictions about the number of seats to be won or lost.” That assertion was challenged by the Daily Mirror’s political editor, who pointed out that Corbyn had clearly said Labour was “not going to lose seats”. Corbyn’s aide clarified that the leader said in his previous sentence and elsewhere on many occasions that he was not going to make predictions about gains and losses. Asked whether Corbyn had misspoken, the spokesman said: “I’m telling you what he intended to say. He was saying we are not in the business of losing seats.” Downing Street has just issued new details of the child refugee climbdown. Child refugees who registered in Greece, Italy or France before 20 March (when the EU/Turkey migration agreement came into force) will be eligible for resettlement in the UK, it says. Here is an extract from the news release. Unaccompanied asylum-seeking children will be resettled from Greece, Italy and France, in an initiative announced today following discussions between the government and Save the Children. This initiative builds on last month’s announcement that up to 3,000 vulnerable children and family members will be resettled direct from the Middle East and North Africa. And it adds to the resettlement of 20,000 people direct from Syrian refugee communities, which has been under way since last year. The government has always adopted a twin-track approach to dealing with the migrant crisis: helping the most vulnerable while not encouraging new perilous crossings to Europe. That approach will continue through this initiative, by restricting resettlement to children registered before the EU migration agreement with Turkey came into force on 20 March. The retrospective nature of the scheme will avoid creating a perverse incentive for families to entrust their children to people traffickers. And it will mean that the UK can focus on the most vulnerable children already in Europe without encouraging more to make the journey. The government says it is not putting a figure on the number of children who will be accepted, but that it “will instead work with local authorities across the UK to determine how many children will be resettled”. The first arrivals are due before the end of the year, it says. After PMQs a spokesman for Jeremy Corbyn said Corbyn’s use of the term “friends” to refer to Hamas and Hezbollah was about “a diplomatic term of address in a meeting about peace and reconciliation”. The spokesman went on: He has been involved in peace and reconciliation processes all over the world, including Latin America, the Middle East, Ireland and elsewhere and he will continue to pursue dialogue in areas of conflict, as he always has done. He has been involved in various peace and reconciliation initiatives in which all the parties to the conflict have been met Jeremy has said repeatedly that anti-Semitism in any form in society and in the Labour Party is completely unacceptable and repugnant and will be acted upon, and he has acted on it. In the time that he’s been leader, 18 people have been suspended in relation to anti-Semitic allegations or incidents, and every single one of those has taken place within 48 hours. I should say that getting on for half of those relate to incidents or online posts before Jeremy Corbyn was leader. He has taken more action, more quickly, than any other Labour leader or any leader of any other party. And this is what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs on Twitter. Generally the view seems to be that it was a win for Cameron, but a messy and unpleasant one. From the Daily Mirror’s Jason Beattie From the Daily Mirror’s Kevin Maguire From the New Statesman’s George Eaton From the Daily Telegraph’s Christopher Hope From Sky’s Adam Boulton From the Sunday Times’s James Lyons From the Birmingham Post’s Jonathan Walker From the Sun’s Craig Woodhouse From the Yorkshire Post’s Kate Proctor From the Specator’s Isabel Hardman From the BBC’s Norman Smith From PoliticsHome’s Kevin Schofield PMQs verdict: There is a time and place for a sensible discussion about whether or not Jeremy Corbyn is unduly sympathetic towards certain terrorists organisations, like Hamas and the IRA. It is a debate that can encompass the evils of colonialism, the willingness of governments to conduct secret negotiations with terrorist groups, Corbyn’s own personal aversion to violence, quite what he meant when he spoke about his “friends” from Hamas (he has said he uses the phrase about all groups invited to meetings he chairs, although it is hard to imagine him using it in association with, say, Ukip) and his refusal repeatedly to condemn the IRA in an interview last summer. But PMQs is not the time and place for a sensible discussion about anything. It is a coarse and rather brutal arena in which, as Cameron once said, you are either the lion, or the Christian who gets eaten. It’s a contest to assert political authority (which, by the way, is why the complaints about it being Cameron’s job to answer questions, not ask them, are beside the point). And today, by challenging Corbyn repeatedly on extremism, Cameron easily came out on top. It wasn’t particularly pleasant to watch, but human sacrifice in the amphitheatre never was. To his credit, Corbyn did not fold. He made an effective point about the Tory hypocrisy over Suliman Gani, and he came close to retracting the comment about his “friends” from Hamas when he said that anyone who did anything racist could not be a friend of his. But that was not enough to stop Cameron demanding a full retraction. Could have have done anything different? A full apology and withdrawal might have done the trick, but that would have involved Corbyn turning his back, or at least partially turning his back, on things he has said and believed for his entire political career, and that is not something he is able to do. I normally miss Angus Robertson’s questions in the PMQs minute-by-minute, but I know from reading comments BTL that this annoys readers so a colleague has been helping out. Here are extracts from the exchanges. This is where David Cameron announced the U-turn over child refugees and the Dubs amendment. Angus Robertson: Last week the prime minister took issue when I raised the issue of unaccompanied syrian refugee children in Europe and the Kindertransports of the 1930s ... Why has it taken so long and a threat of a parly defeat for the PM to begin changing his mind? David Cameron: Let’s be clear that no country has done more than Britain to help when it comes to syrian refugees. No country has raised more money, and only the United States has spent more money. But I do want us to proceed with as much support across the house as we can. I think it’s right to stick to the principal that we shouldn’t be encouraging people to make this dangerous journey. I think its right to stick to the idea we keep investing in the refugee camps and in neighbouring countries and I also think its right not to take part in the EU resettlement schemes. Robertson came back, and in his second answer Cameron said the government would accept the Dubs amendment. He said: I do reject the comparison with the Kindertransport, I would argue that what we’re doing primarily which is taking children from the region, vulnerable people from the camps, going to the neighbouring countries and taking people in to our country. That to me is like the Kindertransport. To say the Kindertransport is taking today children from France, Germany or Italy - safe countries that are democracies - I think that is an insult to those countries. It won’t be necessary to send the Dubs amendment back to the other place. We’re going to go round the local authorities and see what more we can do but let’s stick to the principle we should not be taking new arrivals to Europe. Labour’s Keith Vaz, a Leicester MP who is wearing a Leicester City scarf, says Gary Lineker said he would present Match of the Day in his underway if Leicester won the championship, he thought it was so unlikely. Does Cameron agree that if you make a promise, you should keep it. Cameron says he does agree. He notes from what Lineker says that he has not yet given a definite answer. Greg Mulholland, a Lib Dem, asks about a war widow who lost her pension when she remarried. Cameron says the government changed the rules so that this does not happen in future. But, like previous governments, it has taken the view that the rules should not be changed retrospectively. John Baron, a Conservative, says the Tories must be a one nation party. Does Cameron agree if we leave the EU wages will rise. Cameron says that if we leave the EU the economic consequences will be negative. That is what the experts say, he says. Labour’s Graham Allen asks Cameron to help get a “what works” centre looking at tackling sexual abuse up and running. Cameron says the Home Office is setting up a centre on preventing sexual abuse and exploitation. David Cameron has said his government will not stand in the way of an amendment by Lord Dubs paving the way for the UK to take unaccompanied refugee children who have already arrived in Europe. The prime minister gave credit to the Labour peer, who was a refugee himself as part of the kindertransport, and said that he would accept it now that it no longer included the figure of 3,000 children. “It won’t be necessary to send the Dubs amendment back, it doesn’t mention a number of people. We are going to speak to local authorities to see what we can do,” the prime minister told MPs. However, he said he wanted to stick to the principle that Britain would not take in new children who were arriving in Europe because he believed that it could act as a pull factor, and argued that other European countries ought to be safe places. The SNP’s Margaret Ferrier asks what protections the goverment is seeking for the NHS in TTIP. Cameron says this is “the reddest of red herrings”. The NHS is totally protected, he says. Labour’s Stephen Kinnock asks what is being done to ensure that Tata is a responsible seller. Cameron says the timetable for a sale is short. The government is working with Tata to help the sale go through. David Amess, a Conservative, asks about the Chilcott report. Cameron says he expects the Chilcott report to come “not long after” the EU referendum on 23 June. The SNP’s Patrick Grady asks Cameron to review guidance saying it is acceptable to send asylum seekers back to Eritrea. He says it has been described as the North Korea of Africa. Cameron says he will look at this. Martin Vickers, a Conservative, asks about a road in his constituency where new safety work is required. Cameron says he will look at this. The Green MP Caroline Lucas asks Cameron to define a “modal verb”. Cameron says the whole point of these tests is to ensure that the next generation is better educated than we are. Snap PMQs verdict: A wretched 17 minutes for Corbyn. This is not the first time Cameron has attacked Corbyn’s alleged extremist sympathies at PMQs, but today the onslaught was particularly timely and pertinent. Corbyn made a reasonable fist of trying to defend himself, dissociating himself from the “friends” remark about Hamas (although not retracting it as bluntly as Cameron proposed) and pointing out, quite rightly, the hypocrisy of the Tory attacks on Suliman Gani. And the Cameron broadside was not especially fair, because there is probably no one in parliament who believes that Corbyn actually approves of Hamas rocket attacks on Israelis. But Corbyn has been more sympathetic to groups like Hamas than MPs in the political mainstream, meaning that Cameron’s comments had enough justification to give them potency. Today Cameron exploited that to the full, with brutal effect. Corbyn says Ghani is a Conservative. And he quotes a former Tory candidate saying she was ashamed of the “repulsive campaign of hate” in Goldsmith’s campaign and would be voting Labour. Corbyn turns to inequality, and says the government is taking away the measures that can tackle it. Cameron says inequality is going down under this government. He says the government is investing in schools and homes. He may be a friend of the terrorist group Hamas. But he is a friend of aspiration. Corbyn says politics is about choices. Cameron’s govenrment has cut income tax for the richest, and cut corporation tax again and again. Tomorrow people can make their choices. The Tories want to cut taxes for the rich. Labour want decent services for everyone, he says. Cameron says Corbyn is right. Politics is about choices. People can back a party that puts extremists over working people and is incapable of providing leadership. Cameron says Corbyn needs to stand up and say Hamas and Hezbollah are not his friends. Corbyn says anyone who commits racist acts is not a friend of his. He says Cameron should reflect on the way Zac Goldsmith has smeared Sadiq Khan in London. He says a Joseph Rowntree report found 1.5m are unable to afford the thing they need. Cameron says the stronger economy means more people are in work. He rejects what Corbyn said about Khan. We are not responsible for what people say who we share a platform with. But there is a pattern of behaviour here. Khan shared a platform with someone who trained the 7/7 attacks. And he shared a platform with someone who called for Jews to be drowned. And he then said they were just flowery words. He challenges Corbyn again to withdraw what he said about Hamas/ Corbyn says Suliman Gani, the imam that Cameron attacked Khan for sharing a platform with is a Conservative supporter. And he says Andrew Lansley said some time ago racism was endemic in the Conservative party. Cameron should set up an inquiry too. He asks Cameron to follow the example of the Welsh Labour government in placing a responsibility to help people in a housing crisis. Cameron says the government has built twice as much council housing as Labour. He quotes some of the views of Gani. Jeremy Corbyn welcomes Cameron’s comment about Leicester, and asks if this means he will be supporting another team, in addition to the two he supports already. He says preparations for anti-Holocaust day are starting in Israel. We all have a duty to oppose antisemitism, he says. He asks about council cuts. Cameron used to say we were all in it together. What happened to that. Cameron welcomes what Corbyn said about anti-Holocaust day, but he quotes Corbyn saying in the past it would be a pleasure to host his “friends” from Hamas in parliament. Corbyn says he has made it clear Labour is an anti-racist party. It has established an inquiry into antisemitism. He says Cameron is referring to a meeting he hosted to try to help the peace process. His remarks do not amount to an approval of those organisation. If social care is a priority, why has £4.5bn been cut from the adult social care budget, leaving 300,000 without the care the need. Karl McCartney, a Conservative, asks Cameron to condemn the actions of Hezbollah and Hamas. Cameron say the point about Hamas is important. They are a terrorist group who believe in killing Jews. He says Corbyn needs to withdraw the remark about Hamas being friends. The SNP’s Martyn Day asks Cameron to stop air strikes in Syria, which had done nothing to bring about peace. Cameron says we should continue to hit Daesh terrorists, but also do everything to support dialogue between the opposition and the Syrian regime. David Cameron starts by congratulating Leicester on winning the Premier League. They have shown superb ability and a great team ethic, he says. PMQs is about to start. Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, has admitted the furore over anti-semitism within Labour after Ken Livingstone’s remarks last week has damaging the party chances in tomorrow’s Scottish parliament election. With Scottish Labour now neck and neck with the Tories in Holyrood polling, Dugdale told the Guardian that voters were raising the controversy in the final days of the campaign. “It has unquestionably had an effect,” she said. Insisting she was going to “keep smiling”, Dugdale added: I’m not going to go into the business of analysing what has happened over the past few days but it is coming up on the doorsteps. I’m going to carry on doing what I have always done in this campaign which is make a positive case for how we can use the powers of the Scottish parliament to make different choices from the Tories in Scotland. Sadiq Khan, Labour’s candidate for London mayor, was interviewed on LBC earlier. Here are the main points. Khan apologised for using the phrase “Uncle Toms” seven years ago. As today’s Sun reports, he used the phrase in 2009, when he was a communities minister. Khan told LBC that he was using it in a self-deprecatory way, to explain the need to reach out to the wider minority ethnic community. But he accepted that using the phrase was wrong. He said: I regret using the phrase. I do regret using the phrase and I’m sorry. He said Zac Goldsmith’s campaign had been “divisive” and worse than any mainstream campaign he had seen in his lifetime. Some of the tactics used are not the sort of tactics that I’ve seen in mainstream politics in my lifetime. Khan said he was worried that Goldsmith’s campaign would deter Asians and Muslims from going into public life. He said: During the last few weeks in particular I’ve met more and more and more Londoners, Asian origin, some of them Islamic faith, who are saying, ‘You know what, we’ve done really well in business, or accountancy, or medicine, we were thinking about our children, encouraging them to go into politics, to get involved in public life, but you know what, no, after what’s happened to you, we are not going to do that’. What I’m saying to them is, no, you must do it. I’ve never talked about some of the racism I suffered when I was a young lawyer, or as a young politician. I’ve always talked about how easy it is. ‘If I can do it, you can do it, it’s so easy, just listen to your teachers, you can do it, join a mainstream party.’ I’m the man that celebrated when Adam Afriyie was elected in Windsor. I think that it’s great that there are parties competing for minority votes. I think Sajid [Javid] in the cabinet and Priti [Patel] is fantastic for our way of life. We’re not all the same, Asian people. We’ve got different views ... So I’ve been disappointed. I don’t like talking about it because I don’t want people to think, ‘If that’s what Sadiq’s family went through, why should we want to be a councillor?’ He denied a claim that he does not want Jeremy Corbyn to attend his victory party if he wins in London. He criticised Boris Johnson for giving the impression that “mayors can’t do much”. Johnson implied that the job of a mayor was just to walk on red carpets and crack a few jokes, he said. Actually, mayors can do a huge amount. I’ve met with and studied mayors from around the world. A mayor can use the levers given to him or her by parliament, the powers, but also to use the pulpit of City Hall to persuade people to do stuff for the betterment of London. The Home Office minister James Brokenshire will answer the urgent question, Laura Kuenssberg reports. It seems it won’t cover child refugees. ITV says David Cameron is expected to announce a climbdown on unaccompanied child refugees at PMQs. Piers Corbyn, Jeremy’s brother, has defended Ken Livingstone in relation to the row about Hitler and Zionism. Jeremy suspended Livingstone from the Labour party for the comments, but Piers has told the Evening Standard that Livingstone was “misunderstood”. He told the paper: I think Ken has been misunderstood, because he has been talking actual history which now looks incomprehensible. We can’t understand now the context those things happened in, but there is numbers of historical documents around which seem to bear out some things that Ken has said. But they’ve been taken out of context ... The relationship between Nazis and the Jews, and Russia, have been complicated and there have been serious alliances, or mutual supports, or dealings which are difficult to understand now. There is an urgent question on the proposed changes to EU asylum rules in the Commons at 12.30pm. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg is wondering whether this will be when we get the child migrants climbdown. Responding to government suggestions that it is going to offer a compromise over unaccompanied child refugees (see 10.07am), Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour’s refugee taskforce, said the government needed to do a “proper U-turn” on this. Fear of losing Monday’s vote on the Dubs amendment has led to the government briefings that they are looking at this again. Now we need real action. We were promised a few weeks ago that the government would make concessions, but in the end they only re-announced the same help for refugees outside Europe. That won’t be good enough his time. We need to see real action to help child refugees who are at risk of abuse, exploitation and trafficking within Europe. So far ministers have only ever announced increased support when under serious political pressure - we will keep this up until next week’s vote. Across the country there is strong support for Britain to do its bit to give sanctuary to vulnerable children just as we did with the Kindertransport decades ago. And Kindertransport survivors have been the strongest voices calling on us to help once more. Now we need real action and a proper u-turn from the prime minister, not just warm words. LBC and ITV have released a London mayoral poll this morning showing Labour’s Sadiq Khan extending his lead over his Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith. Here is an extract from the news release. In the race for City Hall, Khan now leads Goldsmith 56% compared to 44%, when the second preferences of those voting for another candidate are taken into account. This represents an increase of two points from the previous ComRes poll for LBC and ITV News London conducted in April, suggesting that the Labour candidate is moving ahead with just one day to go before the mayoral elections. One in five Londoners (19%) say that Zac Goldsmith’s campaign has been ‘dirty’, opposed to 8% for Khan, and a third of those questioned (32%) describe Khan’s campaign as ‘positive’ and ‘inspiring’ (16%), compared to 23% and 9% respectively for Goldsmith. However, while 45% say that Khan is ‘passionate’, 20% of Londoners think that he is ‘extreme’. In comparison, 32% think that Goldsmith is ‘passionate’ and 13% say that he is ‘extreme’. The poll also suggests that, if Boris Johnson were the Conservative candidate, he would beat Khan by by 41% to 39%. The Electoral Commission has got a meeting today with the police and the Crown Prosecution Service at which it will try to persuade them to apply for a court order to extend the time limit for a possible prosecution in relation to claims the Tories overspent in some constituencies during the general election. This is from the Press Association. Tories face claims that accommodation costs of activists bussed into key constituencies around the country should have been recorded under individual candidates’ limits, rather than as part of the national campaign. The Electoral Commission believes its ongoing probe into alleged breaches of reporting obligations will take at least another month - taking it past the one-year time limit for launching criminal proceedings. It is meeting with police forces covering the constituencies involved and the Crown Prosecution Service to ask them to seek an extension to ensure the door is not closed. Claims about the Conservatives’ general election spending - as well as that at three parliamentary by-elections - were first raised by Channel 4 News. The party blames an “administrative error” for failing to register some accommodation costs. But David Cameron insists it was right to include such expenditure as part of the national campaign rather than against the limits imposed on individual candidates. Bob Posner, director of party and election finance and legal counsel at the Electoral Commission said: “The police and the CPS both have the power to apply to the courts to extend the time limit on bringing criminal prosecutions for electoral offences to allow for full investigations to take place. We have requested that they consider doing this.” The commission said it did not take any view as to whether the party should be pursued under the Representation of the People Act (RPA) 1983, which regulates candidate spending. There is more detail here, in a statement from the Electoral Commission last week. The commission said the meeting was taking place this morning, but it would not give any more details, or so who would be attending. And it is not clear yet whether the CPS will announce today whether or not it intends to comply with the commission’s request and seek a court order to extend the time limit for prosecutions. Yesterday it emerged that the government is considering further concessions on Britain accepting unaccompanied child refugees from Europe ahead of a vote next week which could see up to 30 Tory MPs rebelling and voting in favour of a Labour pro-refugee amendment to the immigration bill. This morning the Conservative MP Heidi Allen, who abstained in the first vote on this (she explained why she did not vote against the government on her blog) told the Today programme that she was “100%” determined to rebel in next week’s vote and that “many” Tory MPs felt the same way. But George Osborne, the chancellor, told the BBC this morning that discussions were still going on and that an announcement about new measures (intended to avert the revolt) would be made in due course. Britain has always been a home to the vulnerable and we’ve always done what we need to do to help people who are fleeing persecution. That’s why we are taking people from the refugee camps as a result of this terrible Syrian civil war and we’re working with others, with charities, with other political parties, talking to people about what we can do to help the unaccompanied children as well, where we’re already providing financial support. So we are in those discussions and those discussions will go on and you will hear what we’ve got to say in due course. On the Today programme the Labour MP Louise Ellman, who is Jewish, welcomed the chief rabbi’s article, saying he was “quite right”. She went on: This is a very serious problem. I think we need a great deal more education about what antisemitism is. Criticising the government of the state of Israel is absolutely legitimate. But when the world’s only Jewish state is demonised, treated in a way no other state is, when people talk about conspiracy theories, they talk about Jewish power and Jewish control, indeed applying to Zionism exactly the same untruths that are applied to Jews in straightforward antisemitism, we are moving into antisemitic territory. And that has to be understood. I don’t think it is understood at the moment. Just as the row about antisemitism in the Labour party was starting to die down, the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, has propelled it back on to the front pages with a forceful article in the Daily Telegraph. It is the first time he has commented since the Labour MP Naz Shah was suspended last week, prompting Ken Livingstone to try defending her with his bizarre ramblings about Hitler. There are three key points in the article. Mirvis suggests he is worried that the inquiry into antisemitism in the Labour party could just amount to “political posturing”. He said he welcomed Jeremy Corbyn’s decision to announce the inquiry, but he said he was worried about people saying the allegations about antisemitism in the party were not genuine, but were just a “smear”. In recent days, we have heard anti-Semitism in the Labour Party described variously as “a smear” and as “mood music” being manipulated by political opponents of Jeremy Corbyn. There has been nothing more disheartening in this story than the suggestion that this is more about politics than about substance. The worst of mistakes, in trying to address this problem, would be to treat it as a political attack which requires a political solution. If this inquiry turns out to be no more than a sticking plaster, designed to placate and diffuse until after the elections this week, the problem will surely get worse and not better. Jeremy Corbyn has stated that his party “will not tolerate anti-Semitism in any form,” and I very much hope that this inquiry will deliver on that pledge and be followed by decisive action. All political parties share in the responsibility to rid our society of anti-Semitism but we cannot achieve that objective with political posturing or empty promises of action never to be fulfilled. One person making the “smear” claim has been Corbyn’s close ally Diane Abbott. She told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: “It’s a smear to say that Labour has a problem with antisemitism. It is something like a smear against ordinary party members.” Mirvis argues that attacking Zionism amounts to antisemitism. Zionism is a belief in the right to Jewish self-determination in a land that has been at the centre of the Jewish world for more than 3,000 years. One can no more separate it from Judaism than separate the City of London from Great Britain. Open a Jewish daily prayer book used in any part of the world and Zionism will leap out at you. The innumerable references to the land of Israel are inescapable and demonstrative ... Zionism is a movement celebrated by people right across the political spectrum, all over the world, and requires no endorsement or otherwise of the particular policies of any Israeli Government at any time. But to those people who have nevertheless sought to redefine Zionism, who vilify and delegitimize it, I say: Be under no illusions – you are deeply insulting not only the Jewish community but countless others who instinctively reject the politics of distortion and demonisation. And, in particular, he effectively accuses Livingstone of spreading antisemitism. To those who so eagerly reach for a vicious Holocaust reference in order to exact the maximum amount of pain and offence upon “Zionists”, I say: You are spreading that ancient and insidious virus of anti-Semitism. I will be posting reaction to the Mirvis article as it comes in. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Sadiq Khan, Labour’s candidate for London mayor, is interviewed on LBC. 12pm: David Cameron faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 4.30pm: Cameron gives evidence to the Commons liaison committee about the EU referendum. I will be focusing in particular on PMQs and Cameron’s appearance at the liaison committee but, as usual, I will also be covering the breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary after PMQs and another in the afternoon. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m @AndrewSparrow.

If you think there are any voices that I’m leaving out, particularly political figures or organisations giving alternative views of the stories I’m covering, do please flag them up below the line (include “Andrew” in the post).

European commission faces challenge to grant visa-free travel to Turks,"The European commission faces an uphill battle to grant Turkish citizens visa-free travel through most of Europe by the end of June, a crucial element of the EU’s deal with Ankara to curb refugee arrivals. A related plan to overhaul asylum rules was also running into trouble just hours after it was unveiled on Wednesday, as central European countries denounced the measures as ridiculous and tantamount to blackmail. The EU executive on Wednesday gave its provisional blessing to visa-free travel for Turkish tourists and short-stay travellers to the Schengen Area, which excludes the UK and Ireland. It backed the scheme on the condition that Ankara upgrades laws on anti-corruption, terrorism and data protection in the next few weeks. In another important caveat, visa-free travel would only be available to those Turks with biometric passports that include fingerprint recognition chips. Such passports do not exist in Turkey, although the government plans to introduce them from 1 June. The promise of visa-free travel through Europe was a key part of the bargain EU leaders struck with Turkey to stop the flow of migrants and refugees onto the Greek islands. But Hungary has already rejected the plans, while MEPs vowed to block them unless Turkey stops using anti-terror laws to “silence” journalists. The final decision on whether Turkish citizens will get visa-free access to the Schengen Area for stays of up to three months rests with the EU’s 28 member states and the European parliament. All 28 EU leaders signed off on the goal of easing visa rules as part of the refugee deal struck with Turkey’s prime minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, in March, but there are no guarantees the deal will go through. The proposals will face opposition in the European parliament, as MEPs insist they will not be bounced into a decision. The two largest groups in the parliament, the centre-right EPP and the Socialists, said they would not back the visa plan unless Turkey met all 72 of the EU conditions. “The European parliament should vote on visa liberalisation only if Turkey meets all the criteria and after the EU ministers for interior affairs have thoroughly reviewed the situation,” said the EPP leader, Manfred Weber. Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the smaller Liberal group, urged MEPs to block the proposal unless Turkey revised its anti-terrorist legislation, which, he said had been used “in a brutal clampdown on Turkish and foreign journalists by the Turkish government”. He also called for the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to drop charges against Jan Böhmermann, a German comedian, who is being prosecuted in Germany for lampooning the Turkish president in an offensive poem. Böhmermann criticised the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Tuesday for agreeing to Ankara’s request to prosecute him for offending a foreign leader. EU home affairs ministers will discuss the visa plans next month. The commission on Wednesday tried to assuage French and German concerns by proposing an emergency “snapback mechanism” that would allow the EU to suspend visa-free travel for six months if there were a surge in Turkish nationals staying illegally in Europe or a jump in asylum applications. But this seems unlikely to placate members of Merkel’s own party, who have been sceptical, while its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, actively opposes the deal. “We cannot swap the wave of refugees for a wave of visa applications,” said the CSU party secretary, Andreas Scheuer. “We are against importing inner-Turkish conflicts to Germany.” François Fillon, a former French prime minister and presidential candidate for the centre-right Républicains, also come out against visa liberalisation for Turkey. “The decision of the European commission is not acceptable as it stands,” he wrote on Twitter. The visa proposal is unlikely to result in an immediate surge of Turkish visitors to the 26-country Schengen zone. Only 10% of Turkey’s 79m people have passports and none have the EU-standard biometric documents required, which will be produced in runs of up to 10,000 a day from June. Although the UK is not directly affected, Brexit campaigners seized on the visa recommendation. The Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, said it was “a huge error of judgment” and claimed Turkey had moved a step closer to EU membership. “The chaos from the beaches of Greece has evidently moved to the corridors of Brussels. The EU has rolled over to the blackmail from President Erdoğan.” As recently as 20 April, Turkey had met only half the EU’s 72 criteria for visa-free travel, a list that includes introducing biometric passports, stepping up border controls and guaranteeing fundamental rights for minority groups, such as Roma citizens. Ankara has been racing to meet the standards, even chartering a private plane to rush hastily-ratified treaties to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. But five conditions still need to be cleared, including passing anti-corruption laws, rewriting domestic law on terrorism to avoid conflicts with freedom of expression, and bringing data protection rules in line with EU standards. The vice-president of the commission, Frans Timmermans, insisted Turkey was not getting a free ride. He defended the EU’s approach to engaging with Ankara, even though he stressed that Turkey was moving away from Europe on democratic standards and freedom of the media. “In the past years of not engaging with Turkey, in just shouting over the fence at each other, what has that done for human rights, the rule of law, democracy freedom of the media in Turkey? Nothing. It has only worsened,” he said. “If they are to come closer to the European Union, they will have to demonstrate they adhere to our values.” The Turkey decision was announced as the commission published long-awaited plans to overhaul EU asylum rules, including “solidarity payments” of €250,000 (£198,000) per asylum seeker from countries who refused to take refugees as part of a quota system. The aim is to reduce pressure on EU’s frontier states, notably Greece and Italy, which are struggling to cope with large numbers of refugees. Timmermans warned that a failure to work together could doom European unity. “If there is no solidarity here, there will be no solidarity elsewhere. And that will be a huge blow to the European project.” The plea for unity was met with a volley of complaints from four central European countries, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, who denounced the asylum plans as unacceptable. Poland’s interior minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, said they made no sense and Hungary said they amounted to blackmail. The new rules would only apply to the UK and Ireland if they chose to take part, although successive British governments have opted into EU asylum rules, which allow them to send back asylum seekers to other member states. Home Office minister James Brokenshire told British MPs on Wednesday the government would not opt into any system with redistribution quotas. Beyond the eye-catching fines proposal, which may be unprecedented in EU refugee law, the regulation would make significant changes to the treatment of asylum seekers. Any asylum seeker that attempted to move to another EU country could be stripped of benefits other than emergency healthcare. Steve Peers, professor in EU law at Essex University, said this measure would breach the EU charter of fundamental rights, as interpreted by the European court of justice. “Someone could say that at least part of the regulation was invalid, for breach of the charter, and it is possible to strike things down for breaching the charter,” he said. Peers said the commission was “more concerned about the two ‘securitarian’ objectives of sending people back to Turkey and preventing people from moving in the EU”.",REAL
Markes nervous amid weak UK construction and US jobs figures  - as it happened,"Continuing concerns about the state of the global economy after a series of disappointing data from around the world continued to send shares lower. Poor UK construction figures and lower than forecast US private sector job numbers from ADP were the latest repots to unsettle investors. Meanwhile oil slipped back from its early highs after a higher than expected increase in US crude stocks, while metal prices suffered on worries about China after its recent weak manufacturing figures. So commodity companies were among the biggest fallers. And there was always Donald Trump’s approaching victory in the Republican nominations to provide another reason for investors to tread carefully. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 73.57 or 1.19% to a four week low of 6112.02 Germany’s Dax dropped 0.99% to 9828.25 France’s Cac closed 1.09% lower at 4324.23 Italy’s FTSE MIB dipped 0.17% to 17,935.67 Spain’s Ibex ended down 1.26% at 8654.3 In Greece, the Athens market bucked the trend, adding 1.1% to 590.05 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 111 points or 0.6%, while Brent crude is down 0.49% at $44.75 a barrel. On that note, we’ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. In its statement, the ECB said: It has decided to permanently stop producing the €500 banknote and to exclude it from the Europa series, taking into account concerns that this banknote could facilitate illicit activities. The issuance of the €500 will be stopped around the end of 2018, when the €100 and €200 banknotes of the Europa series are planned to be introduced. As expected, the European Central Bank has said it will no longer produce or issue €500 notes. It added that existing notes will still remain legal tender and retain their value. UK prime minister David Cameron is giving evidence to a Commons committee on the EU referendum, and my colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering the meeting, beginning here. The mixed picture from the day’s US economic figures does not mean a June rate rise is completely off the table. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Today’s abundance of US data has made for a difficult trading environment, with contrasting data points providing mixed expectations for monetary policy implications. The overwhelmingly positive release of services and composite PMI readings helped paint an encouraging picture for US business, with improved factory orders and trade balance helping raise rate hike expectations for the June meeting. However, the picture has been muddled by a shockingly poor April ADP non-farm payrolls number, which at 156,000 fell to the lowest level in over two years. The ADP reading is the only figure of the day that has a second bite at the cherry and if Friday’s headline figure confounds today’s ADP weakness, we are likely to see a significant rise in June rate hike expectations. The resurgence of the US dollar this week has sent shockwaves throughout the foreign exchange markets, as traders begin to realise that perhaps a 15-month low in the dollar index makes little sense just six weeks away from an increasingly ‘live’ [Federal Reserve] meeting. While markets are currently pricing in just a 12% chance of a June hike, the reality is likely to be higher, given the hawkish tone of recent Fed member comments. US crude stocks rose by more than expected last week, according to the latest figures from the Energy Information Administration. Inventories climbed by 2.8m barrels compared to forecasts of a 750,000 increase. Crude prices have come off their best levels following the figures, but even so, Brent is still up 0.8% at $45.33 a barrel. Earlier in the day it had climbed as high as $46.01. And here’s the agenda for Monday’s Eurogroup meeting, including talks on the Greece’s debt: The Eurogroup will hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss the state of play of the macroeconomic adjustment programme for Greece. Discussions will cover a comprehensive package of policy reforms as well as the sustainability of Greece’s public debt. Both elements need to be in place in order to finalise the programme’s first review and unlock further financial assistance to Greece. Over in Greece, and efforts are continuing to reach a deal between the country and its creditors ahead of a proposed Eurogroup meeting next week. Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports: Deputy eurozone finance ministers, known as the Euro Working Group (EWG), will hold a conference call on Wednesday aimed at bridging differences between the government in Athens and foreign creditors ahead of a crucial eurogroup meeting on Monday, May 9. The teleconference is expected to focus on an additional 3.6 billion euros’ worth of contingency measures that Greece is being asked to implement should it miss budget targets in 2018. The extra measures have been demanded by the International Monetary Fund, which deems that the 5.4 billion euros’ worth of measures set out in Greece’s third international bailout are inadequate for it to achieve a budget surplus worth 3.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2018. Greek officials have instead proposed the activation of an automatic mechanism for cutting state spending in the event that the government misses budget targets. IMF officials are also expected to take part in Wednesday’s teleconference. Greece will be represented by Alternate Finance Minister Giorgos Houliarakis. And here are some of the comments made by the survey’s respondents: “Severe non-skilled labor shortage is hurting the construction industry.” (Construction) “Business is holding steady, revenue is almost as anticipated and costs are lower which is helping to maintain current profitability.” (Finance &amp; Insurance) “We expect our business condition to improve in Q2 as compared to Q1. Typically, Q1 is our slowest period and business activity picks up later through the year.” (Health Care &amp; Social Assistance) “Very favorable cost conditions all around.” (Accommodation &amp; Food Services) “In higher education we are gearing up for the summer conference season. This impacts (increases) the spend in our service category and drives income from many campuses.” (Educational Services) “Recent upturn in oil prices is creating a slightly more positive outlook for those in the energy industry, but has not been enough to initiate hiring or spending.” (Professional, Scientific &amp; Technical Services) “Business is still improving. Trucking has tightened due to produce hauling season.” (Wholesale Trade) “Heading into a slower season, but cautious optimism of modest gains from same period last year.” (Retail Trade) Here are the details of the ISM survey: And here’s is confirmation of a stronger US services sector. The ISM non-manufacturing purchasing managers index has climbed from 54.5 in March to 55.7 last month, better than the forecast level of 54.7. This is the highest level since December. The new orders index rose to 59.9 in April, up from 56.7 the previous month. But business activity slowed, with the index dipping from 59.8 in March to 58.8. The first set of US services data is out and is slightly better than expected. The Markit services final PMI has come in at 52.8 for April, up from the initial reading of 52.1 and March’s level of 51.3. The final composite reading - both services and manufacturing - was 52.4, up from an initial 51.7 and 51.3 in March. Still to come are the figures from ISM’s services survey. Not surprisingly US markets are once more following their global counterparts lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 106 points or 0.6%, following the weaker than expected ADP jobs data. The disappointing figures added to the general unease about a whole spate of releases pointing to a slowdown in the global economy. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both opened around 0.5% lower. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has fallen 0.99% - albeit off its worst levels - while Germany’s Dax is down 0.74% and France’s Cac is off 0.77%. More from the US. The country’s trade deficit fell by more than expected in March, down 13.9% to $40.4bn, as imports fell to their lowest level since 2010. Meanwhile US productivity dropped at a 1% annual rate in the first quarter, the second quarterly decline. Labour costs rose by 4.1%, the quickest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics which helps compile the ADP jobs data, said: The job market appears to have stumbled in April. Job growth noticeably slowed, with some weakness across most sectors. One month does not make a trend, but this bears close watching as the financial market turmoil earlier in the year may have done some damage to business hiring. The poor ADP jobs data adds to the feeling the US Federal Reserve may not be in a rush to raise interest rates but the report is worrying for the US economy, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco. He said: The US dollar fell sharply in the immediate aftermath of the release as poor jobs data reduces the likelihood of a rate hike next month from the US Fed. Investors see the ADP data as a “heads-up” ahead of the official Non-Farm Payroll report which is due out this Friday. It certainly is effective in measuring the overall trend in the data, but it can be patchy on a month-by-month basis. This is because the government’s number tends to be considerably more volatile, and of course it is this volatility that traders look for and react to. So the fact that today’s release was so far away from trend will have traders scratching their heads. It may be positive for risk assets for the Fed to hold off from hiking rates, but it sends a grim message about the US economy. Ahead of Friday’s US non-farm payroll numbers, the monthly survey of private sector jobs from ADP came in much lower than expected. ADP said US employment increased by 156,000 private sector jobs in April, compared to 194,000 last month and expectations of a rise of between 195,000 and 200,000 this time round. Last month’s figure was revised down from the initial estimate of 200,000. London Stock Exchange shares have dropped more than 7% after Intercontinental Exchange ruled out a bid, leaving the way clear for LSE’s proposed merger with Deutsche Börse. New York stock exchange owner ICE said in March it was considering an offer for the LSE, but now says: Following due diligence on the information made available, ICE determined there was insufficient engagement to confirm the potential market and shareholder benefits of a strategic combination. So it has “no current intention” to make a bid which rules it out for six months unless it receives the consent of the Takeover Panel. Greek manufacturing edged higher in April, but still showed a contraction for the third month in a row. Markit’s manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 49.7, up from 49 in March but still below the 50 level which signals expansion. Markit said: The downturn in the manufacturing sector of Greece continued during April. Incoming new orders fell for a further month while outstanding business levels deteriorated. However, job creation was still evident in the sector and volumes of production stabilised after three months of contraction. But there were some encouraging signs, according to Markit economist Samuel Agass who said: April survey data was mixed for Greek goods producers. On the one hand, the headline PMI remains below the crucial 50.0 no-change mark, thus signalling a further downturn in the manufacturing sector of Greece. Incoming new orders are still on the decline and outstanding business levels again deteriorated at a substantial pace, with a downturn in the construction sector hampering economic growth according to panellists. However, production stabilised for the first time during 2016 and job creation was still evident, highlighting firms’ intentions to invigorate future output with increased manpower. Likewise, purchasing activity rose for the first time since August 2014, highlighting that there are some encouraging signs pointing to a revival in the manufacturing sector of Greece over the coming few months. China has been forced to dip into its emergency pork reserves after seeing prices hit record highs. With breeding sows in short supply, and domestic demand swelling, Beijing has decided to release 3.05 million kilograms of frozen pork reserves over the next month. The FT explains how pork prices have been sizzling recently: Policymakers have good reason to want to keep pork prices under control: China produces and consumes more pork than any other country on Earth, and the meat factors heavily into the CPI basket used to calculate overall consumer inflation. In March the official consumer price index rose 2.3 per cent year on year, with a rise of 28.4 per cent by pork prices during the period contributing 0.64 percentage points. The pork crisis could also be a consequence of China’s industrial revolution. There are now more wealthier middle-class consumers bringing home the bacon, and keen to eat expensive food, but fewer agricultural workers tending the piglets. European stock markets have suffered another morning of hefty losses, as economic worries ripple through trading floors again. The FTSE 100 has hit a new three-week low, down 76 points or 1.2% at 6109 points, while France and Germany are both down around 0.75% The slowdown in Britain’s construction sector, following a shock contraction in manufacturing yesterday, hasn’t helped the mood in the City. Disappointing Chinese and US factory data released this week has also dampened optimism. There may also be a Trump effect. Wall Street is being called down, after the Donald all-but wrapped up the Republican nomination overnight. Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, reckons investors are pretty uneasey today. ‘’A decline in US stocks last night has been followed by another weak day in Asian Indices today, as commodities and bonds are also selling off. Investors appear to remain generally uneasy about the state of the global economy, with the latest agitation coming from the Reserve Bank of Australia deciding on Tuesday to cut its benchmark rate to 1.75%, reflecting soft inflation and, like many others, general economic malaise. A contributing factor to Australia’s economic woes has been a drop in demand from a weary China, which has its own problems as its economy looks to be losing steam on the back of some weak manufacturing data. Another country with weak manufacturing data is the UK – reports suggesting manufacturing activity contracted in April for the first time since March 2013. The slowdown in the oil industry is certainly hitting production, with firms also blaming soft domestic demand combined with a fall in foreign business. Here’s our news story on the construction slowdown: Last Friday, we got terribly excited by the news that the eurozone had grown by 0.6% in the first quarter of 2016, outpacing Britain and America. But perhaps this was premature... New data today shows that retail sales fell by 0.5% in March, which could suggest growth was less buoyant than hoped. Carsten Brzeski of ING fears the data could be revised down in a few weeks (when eurostat will have more data to play with) The BBC’s Kamal Ahmed and Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics are both concerned by the slowdown in UK construction growth. This drop in construction growth comes as Barclays unleashes a no-deposit mortgage on the market. Technically, a parent does need to provide a 10% deposit, but that will be returned - with interest - if their little darling manages to keep up the monthly payments. So for the first time since the collapse of Northern Rock, a major high-street lender is effectively offering to lend the full value of a property. This could be a worrying moment... However, before the credit crunch of 2007, some riskier UK banks would actually lend you 125% of a property’s value. We’re not quite at panic levels yet... David Noble of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply also blames Brexit fears for the slump in construction sector growth. “Fears over weaker UK and global economic growth dealt a blow to confidence in the construction sector, leading to delays in new spending commitments. The prospect of the EU referendum and its outcome in June are likely to add to uncertainty too, with many construction firms preferring to wait and see what happens before making any decisions. “Construction companies adopted a more cautious approach to purchasing and hiring, leading to a rise in sub-contractor usage to tide them over until the outlook becomes clearer. The slowdown in new order growth in April suggests that though spring may be in the air, sunnier times may still be a way off for the construction sector, at least for the time being.” Breaking: Growth across Britain’s construction sector has slowed to a near three-year low. Fears over Britain’s EU referendum, and weakness in housebuilding are to blame -- as concerns about the strength of the UK recovery grow. Data firm Markit reports that its construction PMI, which measures activity across hundreds of building firms, has fallen from 54.2 in March to 52.0 in April. That’s the slowest since June 2013. Companies reported that new orders had stagnated, as the clients suspended spending. With “heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook”, some customers aren’t prepared to commit to new projects. Britain’s EU vote, on June 23rd, is a key Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, warns that the UK construction sector appears to be struggling: “UK construction firms reported their worst month for almost three years in April, meaning that the first quarter slowdown is unlikely to prove temporary. “Stalling new order volumes not only set the scene for further weakness ahead, but are already weighing on staff hiring and input buying across the construction sector. “Softer growth forecasts for the UK economy alongside uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum appear to have provided reasons for clients to delay major spending decisions until the fog has lifted. “An additional factor dragging on construction sector performance is the lack of momentum in residential building. April’s survey highlighted one of the weakest rises in housing activity since early-2013, suggesting that greater caution in this sub-sector is adding to the sluggish growth conditions seen across the wider construction industry.” Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight agrees that the eurozone PMIs are ‘lacklustre’, but remains hopeful that growth will pick up. While they have firmed recently, oil and commodity prices and the euro are still at levels that are supportive to Eurozone growth. Major ECB stimulus that was enhanced in March will increasingly kick in over the coming months, while the fiscal stance across the Eurozone is gradually becoming more growth orientated with increasing fiscal stimulative measures being introduced in a number of countries (along with increased public spending to deal with the influx of migrants). Meanwhile, generally improved job markets across the Eurozone are supportive to consumer spending along with the boost to purchasing power coming from negligible deflation/inflation. Europe’s private sector continued to recover in April, although the revival is less than spectacular. That’s according to data firm Markit, whose composite PMI (which measures private sector growth) has come in at 53.0 in April. That’s only a smidgen below March’s 53.1, and means 34 months of unbroken growth. The eurozone’s Big Four economies all expanded, although Germany appears to be losing some momentum. Companies reported taking on more staff (although in France the increase was marginal). They were also forced to cut prices again to stimulate sales, suggesting the eurozone still face a deflation threat despite the European Central Bank’s stimulus measures. Markit’s Chris Williamson explains: “The final PMI data confirm the earlier flash estimate that the eurozone economy grew at a steady but unspectacular annual rate of 1.5% at the start of the second quarter. Prices charged also continued to fall, indicating that growth is being partly fuelled by price discounting. “However, while still tepid, the sustained eurozone growth contrasts with slowdowns in the US and UK, suggesting the ECB’s more aggressive stimulus is helping to drive a steady recovery. The survey numbers also indicate that domestic demand within the eurozone is picking up which, alongside the weaker currency, is helping to offset sluggish external demand. So it’s not all bad. German service sector growth has slowed; its PMI has dipped to 54.5, from 55.1in March. That still shows expansion, but the slowest rate since last winter. France’s service sector has clawed its way back to growth, with the PMI rising to 50.6 from 49.9 in March. The first eurozone service sector data is out, and it shows that Spanish companies continued to grow last month. The Spanish Services PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, has dipped slightly to 55.1, from 55.3. That’s comfortably over the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. It suggests the prospect of another election (called for late June) hasn’t hit the economy. Mining shares are being hit this morning, pulling the London stock market into the red. Worries over the global economy are being blamed as BHP Billiton sheds 5% and Anglo American loses 3%. BHP is also being hit because Brazilian prosecutors have just filed a $58bn civil lawsuit over the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster which claimed 19 lives last year. Mining shares also fell sharply yesterday, after disappointing factory data from China and the UK suggested economy demand was slowing. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga warns that: The elevated concerns over the health of the global economy complimented with the incessant declines in oil prices have soured investor risk appetite, consequently leaving the FTSE100 vulnerable to further losses. The ongoing supermarket price wars have hit profits at supermarket chain J Sainsbury’s. The company has posted a 14% drop in annual pretax profits, on the back of a 1.1% drop in sales. That’s better than some analysts had predicted. However, CEO Mike Coupe has warned that the market will remain competitive “for the foreseeable future”, sending shares down 1.5% in early trading. Next’s warning on sales and profits could spell bad news for other retailers too. James McGregor, partner at Retail Remedy retail consultants, explains: It was inevitable that the weather would feature in some way in Next’s trading update and we have not been disappointed. If Next have been challenged by the unseasonal weather this season, then we can assume that the majority of fashion retailers are really suffering..... To lower Next’s full price sales guidance range to -3.5%, indicates a sense of nervousness. Ever cautious, we are not surprised to hear Lord Wolfson warn of difficult trading ahead. His caution is understandable though, poor sell throughs are costly. The weather is finally going the right way but the customer might yet hold off buying her beachwear. Retail group Next has got the morning off to a bad start, by cutting its sales guidance for the second time in two months. Once again, bad weather get some of the blame; Next says that recent cold weather in March and April reduced demand for clothing. That follows the unusually mild winter, which hit sales of warm coats. But it also warned that demand for clothing may simply be weaker, as consumers cut back. My colleague Sean Farrell has the details: Though sales have improved in the past few days as weather has improved, the company said demand for clothes could stay weak. In the three months to 2 May Next’s total sales fell by 0.2% and full-price sales dropped 0.9%, at the low end of full-year sales guidance of -1% to 4%. As a result, Next cut its annual guidance for full-price sales to between -3.5% and +3.5%. It slashed its previous guidance in March when Lord Wolfson, the chief executive, predicted this year would be the most difficult since the financial crisis. Next also cut its guidance for annual profit. Pre-tax profit could fall as much as 8.9% to £748m with a best estimate of profit rising 3.7% to £852m. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After yesterday’s jitteriness, traders in Europe are pretty cautious as they wait for a flurry of economic news. Today we find out how the eurozone’s service sector performed last month. It may show that European consumers kept spending last month, despite signs of weakness in the global economy. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets has the predictions: The Spanish economy has been notable for its outperformance in recent months despite continuing high levels of unemployment and today’s latest numbers are expected to come in at 55.1, while Germany is expected to remain unchanged at 54.6. On the downside the French numbers have consistently underperformed, though we are expecting to see a pick up to 50.8 as the French services sector strives to shake off the after effects of the November attacks in Paris. Those figures come between 8am and 9am BST. We then find out how Britain’s construction industry fared last month; will builders feel any impact from Brexit uncertainty? And there’s plenty of company results to wade through; brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev, high street retailer Next, supermarket chain J Sainsbury, oil group Shell and defence group BAE are all updating the City. In the meantime, European markets are likely to open sluggishly as investors worry about the global economic slowdown, yesterday’s fall in the value of the US dollar, and political instability rising in Europe. And that’s before anyone mentions Donald Trump....",REAL
Canada wildfires: worst of blazes 'still to come' after Fort McMurray evacuated,"After a raging wildfire destroyed dozens of homes, engulfed a neighbourhood in flames, and forced the hurried evacuation of an entire city, authorities in Canada warned that the worst was probably still to come. More than 80,000 residents were ordered to leave the city of Fort McMurray in northern Alberta on Tuesday, after shifting winds saw the blaze go from being largely in control to a “nasty, ugly” inferno, as described by the local fire chief. Residents scrambled to make their way out of the city, sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the main route out of the city and struggling to see the road through the thick grey haze that blanketed the highway. Flames licked the road and ash rained down on vehicles, while air tankers and helicopters flew overhead. Gas pumps soon ran dry, leaving many residents stranded on the highway overnight. “[With] the heat from the oncoming smoke and the flames, you could see mini-tornadoes forming near the road,” resident Jordan Stuffco told the Canadian Press. “It was something out of an apocalyptic movie.” Authorities warned that the hot, dry and windy weather expected on Wednesday would probably fuel the fire, which started on Sunday. “The worst of the fire is not over,” said Bernie Schmitte of Alberta Agriculture and Forestry. “We’re still faced with very high temperatures, low relative humidity and some strong winds.” Officials said the fire had grown from about 1,200 hectares to span more than 10,000 hectares in the past two days. “We had a devastating day yesterday and we are preparing for a bad day today,” local fire chief Darby Allen said on Wednesday. “We successfully evacuated 88,000 people. No one is hurt and no one is passed away right now. I really hope we can get to the end of this and we can still say that.” He described the wildfire as a “nasty, dirty fire” that was raging out of control, adding that all efforts to suppress it have so far failed. “There are areas of the city that have not been burned, but this fire will look for them, and it will find them, and it will try and take them.” On Tuesday, 105 patients and clients – including nine newborn babies – were evacuated from city’s only hospital as flames approached.The province’s main oil sands region, a number of oil sands work camps near Fort McMurray were turned into impromptu housing for evacuees. Neighbouring communities also reached out to residents as they fled the flames, staffing recreation centres to provide shelter and bringing gas to stranded motorists. Other residents made their way to the evacuation camps that had been set up outside the city or found lodging in the city of Edmonton, some 435km away, where they took stock of what they had left behind. “When you leave … it’s an overwhelming feeling to think that you’ll never see your house again,” Carol Christian told the Canadian Press. Along with her son and cat, she had driven to an evacuation centre. “It was absolutely horrifying when we were sitting there in traffic. You look up and then you watch all the trees candle-topping … up the hills where you live and you’re thinking, ‘Oh my God. We got out just in time.’” Municipal authorities on Wednesday began detailing the damage that had been caused by the wildfire, including one neighbourhood where 80% of the homes were destroyed. Images on social media showed the flattened neighbourhood of Beacon Hill, the rubble of its many destroyed homes strewn about. In another neighbourhood, a dozen trailers also went up in flames, while serious losses were reported in several other areas. Officials estimate that 1,600 structures have so far been damaged or destroyed by the fire. Some in the city had as little as 30 minutes to evacuate, with many making it out with little more than their vehicle and the clothes on their back. “I didn’t have time for nothing,” said Shawn Brett. He had been at home when his friends called to warn him of the encroaching blaze. He jumped on his Harley motorcycle and made his way out, fighting his way through the smoke and flames that had engulfed his neighbourhood. “I literally drove through the flames. I had ashes hitting my face and the heat from the fire was that bad,” he told the the Canadian Press. “Everything was jammed. It was nothing but the biggest chaos I’d ever seen.” Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, said on Wednesday he had spoken to the Alberta premier, Rachel Notley, to offer the government’s support. “I really do want to highlight that Canada is a country where we look out for our neighbours, and we are there for each other in difficult times,” Trudeau told his Liberal caucus. “And certainly in Fort McMurray, the difficult times they are going through right now is something that we are going to unite around.” He shot down earlier comments made by Elizabeth May, the leader of Canada’s Green Party, that linked the fire to the global climate crisis. “One thing we know is that with climate change there will be more extreme events,” said Trudeau. “But, we know very well that placing a direct link between any fire or a flood and climate change goes a step beyond what is helpful and does not benefit a conversation we must have.” The premier of Alberta said on Wednesday that she planned to head to Fort McMurray to get a firsthand look at the scope of the crisis. “Our hearts are with the families who have had to leave their homes in Fort McMurray,” said Notley from Edmonton. Nearby communities have sent emergency personnel and vehicles to the city. The provincial government has also been in continuous contact with other provinces and the federal government, she said, and now has the resources needed to battle the blaze. “But of course the weather is the key issue.” Queen Elizabeth said she was “shocked and saddened” by the news of the wildfires “Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who have been affected, and we send our heartfelt thanks to the firefighters and the other emergency workers,” she said in a statement. The wildfire comes as a devastating blow to a city already reeling from the impact of slumping oil prices, said David Yurdiga, the MP for the area. The Alberta oil sands rank as one of the world’s largest reserves of oil. “Even with the destruction caused by the fire thus far we will need federal funds to get back on our feet,” he wrote in a statement. “This city has seen thousands of people leave their homes because of the downturn in oil. Fort McMurray cannot handle that and this wildfire.”",REAL
Chancellor says banks' payments to regulators are tax deductible,"Payments by banks to the City regulator are “a routine cost of doing business”, which means they can be deducted from their tax bills, according to George Osborne. The chancellor set out his view in a letter to Andrew Tyrie, who has been seeking clarity from the Treasury after changes in the budget stopped banks being able to deduct compensation paid to customers from their tax bill. That move, aimed at the billions handed out in compensation for payment protection insurance, is expected to add £1bn to banks’ tax payments in the next five years. Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, had wanted to know whether fines and other payments to regulators such as the Financial Conduct Authority would be covered by the change. In a letter dated 4 April, Osborne wrote: “Payments made to regulators are generally deductible for corporation tax purposes. This applies to routine payments made by banks operating in the UK to regulatory authorities to cover the cost of their supervision and oversight.” The chancellor added that payments banks make to the regulators to cover investigations - often known as section 166s - are also deductible, so that banks which have not made any errors are not penalised. This is in line with the tax treatment given to law firms, accountants and those in the oil and gas sector when making payments to regulators. Tyrie, though, is on guard for the currently hypothetical situation that payments made by banks, which might be construed as fines, should create tax benefits for banks. “As long as regulatory payments are made by compliant and non-compliant alike, it is reasonable that they should be treated as a cost of doing business and therefore tax deductible. But in cases where such payments are tantamount to fines, they should not be tax deductible,” Tyrie said. In an earlier letter, dated 15 February, the chancellor had said that fines should not be able to offset tax bills. “I can confirm that fines imposed as a punishment by regulators are non-deductible for UK corporation tax purposes,” Osborne said. In the wake of the Libor rigging scandal, Osborne changed the way that fines were used. In the past they had gone back the regulator, but after the public outcry that followed the £290m fine imposed on Barclays they have have been used to fund a variety of things, including military charities.",REAL
Labour battles to retain local power and build platform for 2020 campaign,"“We have aspirations to get Labour elected all over,” Jeremy Corbyn declared as he launched the party’s election campaign in Harlow, Essex, last month. His message was one of optimism and defiance, holding out the prospect of Labour gains on Thursday 5 May. But as polling day approaches, the party is claiming that a good night would be simply to avoid or limit the loss of councillors. Corbyn’s aides claim their leader was misinterpreted when he said Labour was not going to lose seats. This picture is borne out by Labour campaigners on the ground, who fear that the prospect of regaining dominance in English councils outside the big cities could be a long way off. “To be perfectly frank, it’s going to be very tight,” said Jon Clempner, clad in a neon Labour vest as he knocked doors on Monday. As leader of the local authority in Harlow, Clempner is one of the few powerful Labour politicians in the southern counties, running a little island of red in a sea of Tory blue across Essex. The town has already decided it wanted a Conservative MP, electing Rob Halfon, the champion of so-called “white van” conservatism, in 2010 and again last year. And now, like voters in other postwar new towns created by Labour – Crawley, Milton Keynes and Stevenage – residents are weighing up a change at local level. Many Labour members who voted for Corbyn to become leader hope for a bounce in their party’s popularity now that it has a distinctive anti-austerity message and has drawn a line under the New Labour era. But Clempner said he had not detected a “seismic shift one way or the other since last year”. The goal is to remind voters that they like the Labour council for keeping the street lights on, building affordable housing and dealing sensibly with public finances. “We are basically trying to pretend Europe and national politics doesn’t exist,” Clempner said. This message was echoed by Emma Toal, the deputy leader of the council, who is battling to keep her marginal seat in Harlow Common. “We’ve definitely had some new voters come to us but also we’ve had some go to don’t know. We’ve got enough support here in Harlow Common to win, but the problem here – as at all local elections – is turnout. I honestly think a lot of people will vote the way they voted last year.” She handed a leaflet to a resident cleaning his car in front of a neat 1950s terrace. What about Corbyn? “He doesn’t say much, does he? But I’m Labour whoever’s leader,” he said reassuringly. Not too many people had raised the antisemitism row of the past week, Toal said, but a couple of Jewish voters had got in touch with the local party to say they were unhappy. “They were upset about discrimination and I spent a while talking to them, and said there is no place for it in our party,” she said. “I’m not sure it has got through to the average person.” The challenge for Labour to retain Harlow is repeated in Carlisle, Dudley, Bolton, Plymouth and Southampton, where the party needs to hold on to and consolidate its local power to boost its chances of getting into Downing Street in 2020. Nervousness in the north Corbyn’s arrival in Carlisle on Monday night was pitched as a morale-boosting exercise for Labour’s ground troops. But it was also a sign of nervousness that his party could be in danger of losing control of the council in England’s most northerly city. Despite Carlisle being one of Labour’s top target seats in last year’s general election, the Conservative incumbent, John Stevenson, increased his majority by almost 2,000. Labour is understandably a little jittery about how it will do here on Thursday. Labour took control of Carlisle council in 2012 and currently has 28 councillors to the Conservatives’ 20. A loss of three seats would be enough to plunge the council into no overall control, and the Tories smell blood. They are heavily targeting two wards in the west of the city, Yewdale and Belle Vue, and hope that an Independent candidate can defeat Labour in Botcherby, a poor eastern suburb dominated by a big council estate. Addressing a members-only meeting in Yewdale, where Labour held off the Tories by 12 votes in a local byelection in 2015, Corbyn reportedly said: “We are doing very well; we have got a lot of people knocking on doors and a lot of people very angry at the budget.” Corbyn didn’t knock on any doors himself, but if he had, many voters here wouldn’t have recognised him. Standing with her five-month-old baby on her hip outside her house on the Harraby estate, Samantha Lynn had just promised her vote to Anne Glendinning, Labour’s candidate in Botcherby. Lynn, 31, said she’d never voted before because she wasn’t a “political person”, but she thought Glendinning was nice and so would try to do so on Thursday, “‘cos she’s asked us to”. Neither she nor her sister Steph, 25, had any idea who Jeremy Corbyn was. Glendinning admitted she was frustrated last week when the former London mayor Ken Livingstone’s comments about Hitler dominated the news. “Sometimes I do wonder if they even know down in London we’ve got local elections on. I think: why have you gone and done that? Are you trying to sabotage us?” she said. And yet the antisemitism row had not yet featured on any of her door-knocking sessions. “People are really interested in local issues. If we can solve the problem of dog muck we will be heroes,” she said. Over in the Belah ward, in the north of the city, the Conservative councillor Gareth Ellis said local concerns were not party political: “I’ve never seen leftwing dog poo or a rightwing pothole,” he said. David Morton, another Conservative, who was canvassing with his guide dog, Volley, was reluctant to say that Corbyn’s leadership was a boon for the Conservatives – “people keep telling me he’s a liability for Labour, but we will see what happens”. But many of his voters view Corbyn with distrust. Lewis Gill, 37, an IT worker, said he was a floating voter who had previously supported Labour but no longer trusted them with the economy. Jim Wainwright, a roofing contractor, said he had voted Labour before but wouldn’t do so under Corbyn, whom he described as a “hypocrite of the highest order. He spent all those years voting against everything his own party proposed and now he’s got power he wants everyone to go along with him.” Waning union influence Back in Harlow town centre, few people in the main shopping plaza realised there was an election this week or had heard of Corbyn. An exception was 29-year-old Kevin Bolwerk, who had read some negative media stories about the Labour leader but wanted to make up his own mind based on the facts. He would probably vote Conservative, he said, “because they have better policies for the business I’m in”. Along the high street, Bernie O’Reilly, 85, and his neighbour, explained that Harlow used to be fiercely Labour because of strong trade union influence in the area, but that had ebbed away. A former Conservative voter, O’Reilly was “definitely Ukip” for the local council elections and “definitely out” in the EU referendum, as he said Cameron looked like he wanted to be president of Europe. There is a similar story of a Labour council fighting to keep control in nearby Milton Keynes, according to Andrew Pakes, who ran as a Labour parliamentary candidate and failed to dislodge the town’s Tory MP, Iain Stewart, last year. “Despite the scale of the cuts in local government, in two years Labour has transformed the way Milton Keynes has been run,” Pakes said. “We’ve kept all the libraries open, we’ve kept all the Sure Start centres open, we’ve got the biggest council house building programme outside London, which are under threat because of the noise being created by the positions of Labour nationally. The challenge on the doorstep rarely is the performance of the council. That is the kind of space we are in. If Labour wins on Thursday in Milton Keynes, it will be because we’ve got a bloody good council working hard. If we lose, it will in part be a reflection of Labour’s positions nationally.” If the party loses any councils, it will not just be a matter of hurt pride and disappointment among Labour campaigners for a second year in a row. MPs such as Ben Bradshaw, the former culture secretary, who has helped build a Labour stronghold in Exeter, said winning more council seats in swing areas was essential if Labour was to win the next election. “We managed to buck the trend in Exeter and treble our majority, but without the Milton Keyneses, the Harlows, the Swindons, the Strouds, the Gloucesters at parliamentary level, Labour can never win a majority ever again – particularly in light of what’s happened in Scotland,” Bradshaw said. “We need to be making massive advances in all of those southern England towns and cities if we are to be on course to win the next election.”",REAL
Spain issues arrest warrants for Russian officials close to Putin,"Spain has issued arrest warrants for senior Russian government officials close to Vladimir Putin following a decade-long investigation into the activities of the Russian mafia. A Spanish national court judge is seeking to arrest 12 people allegedly linked to Russian gangsters operating in Spain. They include Vladislav Reznik, a prominent MP for Putin’s ruling United Russia party, and Reznik’s wife Diana Gindin. Also sought are Nikolai Aulov, the deputy head of Russia’s federal narcotics service and Igor Sobelevsky, the former deputy head of the the prosecutor general’s investigative committee, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Most of those wanted by Spain are believed to be in Russia. The high-placed officials are thought to have helped one of Russia’s best-known mafia groups, the Tambov gang, infiltrate state structures, police, port authorities and private banks and corporations. The Tambov and Malyshev gangs, which made their names smuggling heroin in St Petersburg when Putin was deputy mayor in the 1990s, allegedly laundered money through Spanish real estate. They are also accused of murder, extortion and drugs and weapons trafficking. The arrest warrants were issued in January but only became public this week. The Spanish prosecutor’s moves bolster longstanding allegations that the Russian government is a mafia state involved in corruption and organised crime. The reputed head of the Tambov gang, Gennady Petrov, has previously been tied to several of Putin’s closest allies. In 1998-99 he was a co-owner of Bank Rossiya, along with several men who have homes with Putin in the Ozero dacha compound near St Petersburg. In 2014 the US sanctioned Bank Rossiya, describing it as the “personal bank for senior (Russian) officials.” Last month the Panama Papers revealed that managers at Bank Rossiya transferred at least $1bn to offshore firms linked to Sergei Roldugin, a professional musician and Putin’s best friend. Roldugin owns 3.2% of the bank. “The criminal organisation headed by Petrov managed to achieve a clear penetration of the state structures of his country, not only with the lawmaker Reznik but with several ministers,” the Spanish prosecutor’s report said. In particular, Petrov allegedly paid investigative committee deputy head Sobolevsky’s personal expenses and presented him with gifts in exchange for information about police actions against his gang. The Spanish court has reissued 2012 warrants for Petrov, his wife, and a supposed member of the Malyshev gang. The arrest warrants follow a major, multi-stage investigation by prosecutors and Spain’s intelligence services into Russian mafia activity. Russian criminals began using Spain as a base of operations back in the mid-1990s. They laundered profits from illegal activities in Russia and invested them in Spanish real estate. In 2004 Spanish prosecutors created a formal strategy to “behead” the Russian mafia. The Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, an expert on Russian organised crime, helped the police investigation. It was Litvinenko who, according to US diplomats, coined the phrase “mafia state”. A public inquiry last year into Litvinenko’s murder heard that he was due to give evidence to Spanish prosecutors. A week before the meeting in 2006 he was murdered in London with radioactive polonium. Other senior Russian government officials not so far indicted feature in Spanish court papers. They include Russia’s deputy prime minister, Dmitry Kozak, former prime minister Viktor Zubkov, and former defence minister Anatoly Serdyukov, Zubkov’s son-in-law. Also mentioned is Leonid Reiman, a former communications minister. All are close to Putin. The most intriguing name is that of Aulov. The Spanish police collected thousands of hours of intercept material during their inquiry including 78 phone calls between Aulov and Petrov. Shortly before he was killed, Litvinenko wrote an unflattering report about Viktor Ivanov, Aulov’s boss. An inquiry chaired by Sir Robert Owen found last year that the report had fallen into the Kremlin’s hands and may have contributed to Litvinenko’s murder. It is highly unlikely the Kremlin will allow the extradition of any of the wanted Russians to Spain. Russia’s constitution forbids the extradition of its citizens. Putin has refused to extradite to the UK Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun – the two men found by the public inquiry to have poisoned Litvinenko. The Spanish prosecutor alleges that Reznik helped secure government positions inside Russia for the mafia’s preferred candidates. One of them was Alexander Bastrykin, the boss of Russia’s powerful investigative committee. In return, it is alleged, the mafia rewarded Reznik with money and property. Reznik denies wrongdoing and says his friendship with Petrov is purely social. Prosecutors have put out a warrant for Reznik through Interpol, a move that Reznik’s lawyer said had been appealed. The federal narcotics service called the decision to arrest Aulov part of “a political hit job to discredit Russian officials”, RIA Novosti reported.",REAL
Government U-turn on unaccompanied refugee children welcomed by MPs,"Conservative MP Stephen Phillips and Labour MP Yvette Cooper welcomed the government’s U-turn on offering sanctuary to unaccompanied refugee children, after meeting young refugee children in camps in Athens. As the government folded, in the face of mounting pressure, to accept more of the estimated 90,000 refugee children who are travelling through Europe alone, Cooper and Phillips spent the day meeting some of the most vulnerable migrants in Europe. They were at a UNHCR shelter for women and children in an abandoned Olympic hockey stadium, behind the runway of the disused Ellinikon airport, when David Cameron told MPs at prime minister’s questions that he was going to accept a crucial amendment to the immigration bill. The U-turn will mean the UK can give homes to more unaccompanied refugee children, many of whom are currently living in poor conditions in camps such as the one in Athens. Phillips, who was one of a group of Conservative MPs preparing to rebel against the government’s opposition to the Dubs amendment calling for more children to be given refuge in the UK, said he was delighted at the change in position. “The announcement from No 10 today will give these children hope after all they have suffered,” he said, after touring the makeshift accommodation of donated tents set up inside the abandoned sports stadium, with blankets hung from the ceiling for privacy. More than 1,300 people are living in very basic conditions in the stadium; there are no schools for the children, and only very poor washing facilities and basic food supplies. “I am thrilled that they are going to accept the amendment and that this will make a difference to some children in France and Italy and Greece. I think that it is in the best British tradition and what Britain has done in crises like this in the past. It demonstrates again that we are leading the way. The government has listened to us.” Phillips had described this as the “greatest migration challenge since the second world war”, and had been vocal in his opposition to the government’s reluctance to accept more children. Cooper was also pleased that the decision made in London could have a positive impact on the lives of the children in the UNHCR camp. “There are 35 unaccompanied children here who have no proper shelter and are at risk. The ones who are most at risk aren’t even in the camps or the shelters. There are so many children who are not in proper school, or in proper accommodation,” she said. But she said campaigners needed to maintain pressure on the government to ensure that sanctuary was offered on a large scale. “It is a really big change in principle. We have been calling for Britain to take child refugees from within Europe in order to do our fair share for months. “This means for the first time they have accepted that Britain should be taking child refugees from camps like this and we should be doing our best to help children who are at risk of trafficking and abuse. We need to make sure that the government delivers on this. We need to keep up the pressure to make sure we help on the scale that we need to,” she said. Giovanni Lepri, UNHCR’s assistant representative in Athens, said as many as 300 unaccompanied migrant children were currently being held in detention centres in Greece because children’s homes were overflowing. “There aren’t enough places for them. The government recognises this issue and is doing what it can. The last thing the government wants is to have these minors in a situation absolutely not suitable for them,” he said. He welcomed the announcement from London, and was hopeful that it would begin to relieve the pressure on Greece. “The UNHCR is hoping that all European countries will make their policies as open as possible, particularly when it comes to children. In first place in our list of priorities is for the children to have a legal way to reach European countries, where they have longer-term prospects. Greece is making a remarkable effort, but it is evidently not capable of meeting the needs of everyone,” he said. Earlier in the day, the MPs visited a former hotel in the suburbs of Athens that has been converted into a children’s home. It currently houses around 65 children aged between seven and 17 who are fleeing conflict in Syria and Afghanistan, most of them travelling alone without their family. Staff told the MPs that some of the children had seen their parents die en route, some had been separated from them during the journey, while many did not know where their parents were. One of the youngest residents was a seven-year-old girl from Afghanistan, travelling with an older brother, hoping to join an uncle in Germany. “They all want affection. They always need a hug, particularly the seven- and eight-year-olds who are travelling alone. Staff try to avoid playing the role of a father or a mother; they are going to leave us so they shouldn’t become too bonded to us; it is hard,” said the centre’s manager, Tomazina Tsaliki. “They are cheerful, but they worry about what they are going to do next, about their families.” The former foyer of the hotel is thronging with children – running down the concrete steps, their flip-flops slapping on the floor, sitting next to each other on the sofas, waiting for something to happen. Some are in school in Athens, but many are taking basic language and maths classes. Children who are housed here get weekly counselling sessions to help them come to terms with what they have experienced over the past few months. Staff worry more about the children they cannot take in. The hotel is full and has to turn away requests to house more child refugees every day. “All the shelters for unaccompanied minors are full,” Tsaliki said, adding that she did not know what happened to the children they were unable to accommodate.",REAL
Why Trump v Clinton will be an unpopularity contest,"After Tuesday’s Indiana primary, it seems inevitable that in the presidential election in November, Americans will choose between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. It wasn’t always this way. Last summer, Trump was dismissed by some experts as “not a real candidate”, with a 2% chance of winning his party’s nomination. And although Clinton has been the Democratic frontrunner since announcing her bid in April 2015, that a former first lady is running at all is still no small surprise. The question now looming is which candidate can make it all the way to the White House. Making predictions about November in May may be asking for trouble, but by some metrics it looks like Trump’s luck may have run out. When polls have asked voters to imagine a scenario in which they must choose between Trump and Clinton, most have said they would choose Clinton. Since May last year, 67 polls have pitted the two candidates against one another. In 58 such polls, respondents chose Clinton over Trump. Three polls found the two candidates tied and six gave Trump the win – on average by less than four percentage points. However, polling averages show the gap changing considerably. In July 2015 it was vast (Clinton by 20 percentage points); in January 2016 it was small (Clinton by three). Currently, there are 6.5 percentage points between the two. That gap will no doubt continue to change. Imagining who will lose the 8 November election is sometimes harder than imagining who will win. The primary season can warp perceptions. Candidates have a string of wins under their belts by the time they secure the nominations – in this case, Trump has won 28 states and Clinton 25. But those wins may not seem quite so glorious when you attempt to distinguish the popularity of winning candidates from the unpopularity of their rivals. Since June 2015, for example, more Americans have said they have an unfavourable opinion of Trump (on average 60%) than a favourable opinion (35%). Trump’s unpopularity has been pretty consistent. Often, when he appears to catch Clinton in national polling, it’s not so much about a Trump surge as a Clinton dip. And since November, similar polling for the former secretary of state has found that respondents are less inclined to say they have a favourable opinion of her. Clinton’s falling popularity has been so steady that last month she was considered more unfavourable than favourable – just like Trump. That conclusion – that neither of the two candidates Americans will probably have to choose between are viewed favourably by the majority of those Americans – is important. It could affect turnout, especially if there is a particular lack of enthusiasm in one party. Turnout at primaries has been high – almost double that of 2012, according to Pew Research Center. Among Republicans, primary turnout has risen from 9.8% in 2012 to approximately 17.3%. Democratic turnout has increased from 6.3% to 11.7%, although four years ago the incumbent Barack Obama did not face a serious challenger. If Trump can convince more people to show up, he could close the gap. There is another thing Trump will have to do: win over voters who do not identify as Republican. There are a lot of them. The percentage of Americans who describe themselves as independent is at a record high: according to Gallup, which has conducted polls on voter identification since 1988, 42% of respondents say they are independent while 29% say they are Democratic and 26% Republican. Understanding the demographics of Trump’s and Clinton’s supporters can offer important clues about who they need to attract. A recent poll from CNN/ORC found that individuals who said Trump was their first choice for president were more likely to be male, white or older. Of those who described themselves as “independent”, 42% said Trump was their first choice. When asked if they were “enthusiastic” about the prospect of Trump being nominee, 32% of independents said they were and 33% said they were “satisfied but not enthusiastic”. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%. When CNN/ORC conducted the poll, between 28 April and 1 May, they also asked those 1,001 adults (890 of whom were registered voters) about Clinton. Her supporters were more likely to be female, urban or have an income of more than $50,000 a year. Many such findings about Trump and Clinton supporters have been borne out by exit polling during the primary season. At this early stage of gazing into the crystal ball, a couple of things seem possible. Clinton will need to continue to appeal to women and older voters – not least because those groups are more likely to cast a ballot on election day. But the non-white vote will also become a more focused issue. When 31% of the US electorate is not white and there is only a 6% gap between candidates, it’s clear how important such voters could be. Ultimately, though, there is only one thing Clinton needs to do to win the White House in November: make herself less unpopular than Trump.",REAL
BHP Billiton faces £30bn compensation claim over Brazil dam disaster,"The mining group BHP Billiton and its partner Vale are facing a 155bn reais (£30bn) claim from Brazilian prosecutors over an iron ore mine dam collapse last year that released a torrent of toxic mud, killing 19 people and leaving 700 homeless. Shares in the London-listed BHP plunged almost 10% after the charges were revealed into what is being called Brazil’s worst ever environmental disaster. They closed down nearly 6%. The damages claim has been based on the clean-up costs of BP’s Deepwater Horizon accident in the US, say federal prosecutors in Minas Gerais, south-east Brazil, where the two companies’ joint mining venture, Samarco, is based. “Preliminary studies show the human, economic and socio-environmental impacts of the collapse of the dam are, at least, equivalent to those verified in the Gulf of Mexico,” they said. “It does not seem credible, neither technically nor morally, that the value of the human, cultural and physical environment in Brazil should be worth less than other countries,” they added in a statement. BHP said it had not yet received any formal notice of the legal claim but “remains committed to helping Samarco to rebuild the community and restore the environment affected by the failure of the dam”. The Melbourne-based company said a separate lawsuit, which Samarco, Vale and BHP settled with the Brazilian government in March, in which the companies would pay an estimated 20bn reais, was the best way to repair damage caused by the spill. “We believe that the agreement (once approved by the court) provides the long-term remedial and compensation framework for responding to the impact of the Samarco tragedy and the appropriate platform for the parties to work together,” BHP said. That unusually quick deal was praised by President Dilma Rousseff but Brazil’s political climate is turbulent, with Rousseff fighting off a potential impeachment over a completely unrelated bribery scandal. Paul Gait, a senior analyst at Bernstein Investment Research in London, told Reuters the case was politically motivated, with prosecutors wanting to raise the pressure on Rousseff. “They’re implying she had radically undersold the Brazilian people and was in the pockets of business,” he said. Financial analysts see no reason to use BP’s Deepwater Horizon accident as a benchmark for claims as the cases are quite different but it puts the pressure on BHP given BP has so far handed over US$50bn (£35bn). Mining operations have been suspended since the dam burst triggered a tide of mud which buried the village of Bento Rodrigues and swept down the Doce river. The dam was holding “tailings”, a mining waste product of metal filings, dirty water and possibly chemicals. The yellow brown waste travelled 300 miles downstream before cascading into the Atlantic Ocean and threatening beaches. Izabella Teixeira, the environment minister, told the newspaper O Globo that it could take decades for the natural environment to be fully repaired. “It’s clear what happened in the Doce river is the biggest environmental catastrophe in this country’s history. We can’t let it happen again. Our current environmental laws are insufficient to deal with an accident of this kind.” Brazilian prosecutors have a reputation for demanding very high compensation payments, although settlements are sometimes agreed at a much lower cost later on – as was the case with US group Chevron in 2011. That involved an oil spill off the coast of Rio de Janeiro and led to a £12bn claim being lodged but the case was settled three years later for less than £30m. Prosecutors have demanded that BHP, Vale and Samarco put 7.7bn reais into an independently managed fund within 30 days. They have promised to bring in an independent team to assess what the full financial claim should be. Samarco is trying to bring the mine back into operation as quickly as possible but a state environment officer has demanded it should not happen until the company can show pollution has ended. BHP is already struggling with a collapse in its profits as it struggles to cope with rock bottom iron ore, coal and oil prices. In February the group reported a half-year net loss of $5.67bn (£4bn), its first deficit in 16 years.",REAL
Noshir Wadia obituary,"Our former teacher Noshir Wadia, known to us as “Prof”, who has died aged 91, was a pioneering figure in Indian neurology. He was born in Surat, Gujarat, one of five children of Hormusji, a timber merchant, and his wife, Dinamai. He attended St Xavier’s school and obtained his medical qualification from the Grant Medical College in Mumbai (then Bombay). In 1951, after completing an MD, he travelled to the UK to train in neurology, spending four formative years as registrar to the pioneering neurologist Lord (Russell) Brain at the London hospital. At the age of 32, he became honorary neurologist to the JJ hospital and Grant College, Mumbai, with a mandate to establish the first neurology department in India. What started with six beds had grown into a 45-bed neurology department with a formidable reputation by the time he retired in 1982. In 1973, while still at the JJ, he also set up a neurology department at the Jaslok, a private hospital recognised for its postgraduate training. He was a keen observer and a careful researcher. When he returned to India he noticed that the prevalence of neurological diseases was different from those in the standard textbooks. He felt that Indian neurologists should identify and document the prevalence of local diseases. His studies ranged from the neurological complications of manganese poisoning in Indian miners, to the high Indian prevalence of craniovertebral anomalies, Wilson’s disease, tuberculosis presenting primarily as spinal meningitis, and nutritional disorders of the nervous system. He identified two unique Indian diseases later recognised elsewhere - a new variant of hereditary ataxia with slow eye movements, and adult poliomyelitis due to a new virus (Enterovirus 70) associated with conjunctivitis. Prof was also responsible for training a generation of neurologists. His “boys and girls” are now scattered around the world. His skill in clinical neurology was matched by his flair for teaching and bringing the subject alive. He was a charming, humble man with a quick smile and always had a kind word. He forged lifelong friendships with many British neurologists. Some of them regularly visited his unit in Mumbai. He also served the World Federation of Neurology through several of its committees and research groups, finally being elected vice-president. He received many national and international awards, including the Padma Bhushan, India’s third highest civilian award, in 2012. He is survived by his wife, Piroja, a pioneer of clinical neurophysiology in India, by two stepsons, and by two brothers.",REAL
MPs examining BHS offer to cooperate with investigators,"MPs looking into the demise of BHS have written to the insolvency regulator and the Serious Fraud Office offering to cooperate with their investigations. Frank Field, chairman of the work and pensions committee, told the SFO boss, David Green, that MPs wanted to “shed light on what has happened to BHS and identify any regulatory, supervisory or legislative deficiencies” with regard to pensions. He asked the SFO to advise if there were any concerns about MPs’ activity and if they might hinder “any future criminal prosecutions”. The SFO is understood to be conducting preliminary inquiries into the activities of the group of entrepreneurs led by the former racing driver Dominic Chappell, who bought BHS for £1 a year ago. Less than a fortnight after it appointed administrators, BHS is already the subject of at least three inquiries, including an Insolvency Service investigation launched by the business secretary, Sajid Javid, on Tuesday and two by committees of MPs. The SFO has not confirmed or denied that it has begun an inquiry. Field also wrote to the Insolvency Service asking to be advised if its chief executive, Sarah Albon, had any concerns about the work and pensions committee’s investigation. Javid asked the Insolvency Service to bring forward its investigation into BHS, urging the watchdog to consider the extent to which the conduct of the BHS directors led to its collapse into insolvency last week, putting 11,000 jobs at risk. The investigation will not only look at the role of the directors at the time when administrators were called in, led by Chappell of Retail Acquisitions, but their predecessors, led by Sir Philip Green. The Insolvency Service normally waits for the conclusion of a final report by administrators before commencing any investigation into a company – a process likely to take three months. But the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said the “unique circumstances” surrounding the BHS case meant Javid wanted to commence the investigation as soon as possible. The work and pensions committee inquiry will begin on Monday with evidence from the pensions regulator and the Pension Protection Fund, the industry-backed body that is likely to have to make up BHS’s pension deficit of £571m. On Tuesday, Green agreed to appear before an unusual joint session of the business, innovation and skills select committee and the work and pensions select committee. He is expected to go to parliament in mid-June after the committees have taken evidence from other parties, including Chappell and the BHS pension trustees. However, the committees said they had no plans to call Green’s wife, Tina, who was the ultimate owner of BHS, to appear. Retail Acquisitions extracted more than £25m of payments, including professional fees and loan interest, from BHS in the year before it entered administration with debts of £1.3bn. The Guardian has revealed that Chappell could be forced to return millions of pounds paid to his consortium during its controversial 13-month ownership of BHS. The legal director of BHS has written to Chappell asking him for £50,000 that was not repaid after he moved £1.5m from the retailer to an obscure corporate vehicle in the days before its collapse. Meanwhile, administrators are examining whether loans paid to Retail Acquisitions can be called in. Under Green’s stewardship, more than £586m was extracted in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans by the Green family and other shareholders, including The Ivy restaurant owner, Richard Caring. Green has faced calls to give up his knighthood following BHS’s demise.",REAL
"John Kasich quits Republican race, leaving Trump last man standing","John Kasich formally suspended his presidential campaign on Wednesday, paving the way for Donald Trump to clinch the Republican nomination with a personal concession speech that barely touched on the political maelstrom his decision unleashes. The Ohio governor was the last of 16 candidates to see their ambitions blown away by Trump’s unconventional entry into the presidential race, but he went quietly and with little of the drama that has marked earlier exits by other rivals. “I have always said that the Lord has a purpose for me as he has for everyone, and as I suspend my campaign today I have renewed faith, deeper faith, that the Lord will show me the way forward and fulfill the purpose of my life,” Kasich told supporters at a hastily arranged event in Columbus. “Thank you and God bless.” The former House budget chairman and Lehman Brothers executive hinted at his belief in a softer, gentler style of politics, but pointedly did not mention Trump, nor whether he would support him as the party nominee. “The people of our country changed me,” he said, recalling campaign highlights in New Hampshire and Ohio, and thanking his family. “We never had all the money wanted – we were probably outspent by 50:1 – but we did the best we could,” he added, in the closest the 15-minute address got to a postmortem. His decision to suspend his campaign marks the formal end of the most extraordinary race for the Republican presidential nomination in modern political history, and leaves Trump with only the Democratic nominee – likely to be Hillary Clinton – standing between him and the White House in November’s general election. In his first sitdown interview as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Trump immediately waded back into controversy, refusing to back down from his longstanding – and long-since debunked – claims that Barack Obama was not born in the United States, and also refusing to denounce antisemitic attacks on a journalist who wrote a profile about his wife. CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Trump specifically to address his supporters who had sent “vicious” messages to journalist Julia Ioffe this week. After her profile of Donald Trump’s wife, Melania, appeared in this month’s issue of GQ, the Russian-American journalist received a torrent of antisemitic and threatening messages from supporters of the Republican frontrunner. “I don’t have a message to the fans – I’m not gonna talk about that,” Trump said, calling Ioffe’s story “nasty” and defending his wife against unspecified falsehoods in the piece. When Blitzer asked Trump about his past support of “birtherism” – the fervent and unsubstantiated belief that Obama was secretly born outside the United States and is therefore constitutionally ineligible for the presidency, Trump pinned his past statements on his likely opponent in the general election: Hillary Clinton. “She’s the one who started it,” Trump said. The billionaire has long argued that the former secretary of state was the instigator in the birther movement, although evidence for this assertion has not surfaced. Trump, whose senior campaign staff have intimated to Republican party leadership that the candidate would moderate his tone in the general election, also refused to walk back statements on other hot-button issues, including his signature proposal to temporarily ban Muslim immigration into the United States. “I don’t know, I mean, look, I don’t know,” Trump said, when Blitzer asked if such a proposal would alienate America’s allies in the Middle East. “The migration is a disaster – we’re letting in thousands of people. They don’t have documentation, they don’t have paperwork, we don’t know who they are or where they come from.” In an interview with the New York Times Trump said he would implement the ban within his first 100 days, the paper reported. Arduous path John Kasich spent 18 years in Congress, including six years as chairman of the powerful House budget committee, before leaving government temporarily to work as a regional director for failed investment bank Lehman Brothers. He was elected governor of Ohio in 2010 in a close race with an incumbent Democrat and enjoyed home-state popularity measured at record levels in 2015, with 62% of Ohio voters approving of his job performance. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Ohio Democratic party said: “Since last March, Governor John Kasich has spent more than 200 days out of state, pursuing his presidential ambitions and ignoring the needs of the people of Ohio … It’s time that Ohio had a governor who was actually doing something about all of that, rather than gallivanting across the country.” From the outset, Kasich faced an arduous path to the presidency. He came in near the bottom of the pack in Iowa’s first in the nation caucus, polling at less than 2%. He staked his hopes to New Hampshire, where he spent weeks barnstorming the tiny New England state. In its endorsement of the governor, the New York Times editorial board called him the “only plausible choice for Republicans tired of the extremism and inexperience on display in this race”. Kasich celebrated his second-place finish in New Hampshire as if it were a win, and Trump had not clinched an overwhelming victory. Then he pivoted to Super Tuesday, where he eked out second-place finishes in Massachusetts and Vermont. Then, like Florida senator Marco Rubio, he tied his presidential ambitions to winning his home state. By the time Kasich declared victory at a party in Cleveland, his campaign had already conceded that it could not amass enough delegates to clinch the nomination outright. His campaign strategy was to complicate the delegate math and deny Trump the nomination, giving him the opportunity to emerge at a contested convention in Cleveland this summer. He struck an uneasy alliance with Ted Cruz, but that foundered after the Texas senator failed to win Indiana, which Kasich had agreed not to contest. Kasich was expected to perform well in the next several contests. In the end he leaves the race having won only one state and having amassed fewer delegates than Rubio, who exited in March after losing Florida. On the stump Kasich portrayed himself as a “happy warrior”, in contrast to Trump and his visceral appeal. He appeared alongside a ticking debt clock, reminding voters that he balanced the national budget in 1997 and was ready to do it again. He was prone to share anecdotes from his childhood, and admitted to being overcome by emotion when he decided to run for president, the son of a mailman seeking the highest office in the nation. In an effort to appeal to New Yorkers, the midwesterner embarked on a culinary tour, scarfing down pizza, pickles, pasta and pastrami – and on one occasion all in the same meal, attracting scorn from Trump, who said: “I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.” Though he could be awkward in his delivery, and upset some over a comment that women in the 1970s had “left their kitchens” to campaign for him, he also came across as gentle and compassionate. He appeared to try to genuinely connect with voters and often said that he enjoyed the intimacy of town hall events. In South Carolina, Kasich walked over and embraced a tearful young man who shared a personal story about overcoming hardship. But the governor was derided by Democrats for his staunch opposition to abortion and Planned Parenthood. In Ohio, he supported measures to defund the women’s health organization. Some senior Republican officials saw something they liked: the contrast that Kasich, a methodical centrist with a long track record, drew with Trump and with Cruz, who dropped out of the race after his loss in Indiana on Tuesday night. But he failed to gain traction in a year dominated by Trump’s unorthodox candidacy.",REAL
Who will be Donald Trump's running mate? Here are five options,"With Donald Trump as the Republican party’s presumptive nominee, it’s time for him to start contemplating a running mate. Here are five options for the veep stakes for the outsider who has often said he would look for a number two with political experience: Chris Christie Christie’s endorsement of Trump was a pivotal moment for the campaign. But while the New Jersey governor has been a helpful and loyal surrogate, he doesn’t add any geographic balance or conservative credentials. Plus, the footage of Christie standing behind Trump looking like a hostage on Super Tuesday doesn’t help. Newt Gingrich The former House speaker and 2012 presidential hopeful has long been a rare pro-Trump voice in Washington DC. Gingrich would bring considerable political experience and significant public profile as a running mate. It’s just a question of whether Trump wants to double down on a ticket of thrice-married elderly men who love publicity. Mike Huckabee The former Arkansas governor and two-time presidential candidate has long been perceived as supportive of Trump. His daughter is a top political aide on the Trump campaign. While many fiscal conservatives view Huckabee warily, he has a solid social conservative thread and a folksy charm that would pair well with Trump’s big city bluster. It would just mean Huckabee would have to yet again give up a lucrative contract with Fox News for uncertain prospects on the campaign trail. Mary Fallin The Oklahoma governor has reportedly expressed a willingness to be considered as Trump’s running mate and the presumptive nominee praised her as possibility. A two-term governor of the Sooner State who previously served in Congress, her selection would allow Trump to have a woman with significant government experience on the ticket. However, she is best known in Oklahoma for her push to carry out death sentences despite court orders to the contrary. Joni Ernst The gun-totin’, Harley-ridin’, pig castratin’ Iowa farm girl burst on to the scene when she won the Iowa Senate race in 2014. Ernst has shown no willingness to embrace Trump, but the 45-year-old first-term female senator would be an ideal running mate for any Republican. Ernst is an Iraq veteran who won in a swing state. And as her notorious campaign ad proved, she already has the Trumpian flair.",REAL
Italy seeks to reassure Asian tourists with imported Chinese police,"On Rome’s glamorous Via Condotti, deep-pocketed Chinese tourists have long been seen as the lifeblood of one of Europe’s most vaunted shopping destinations, outspending Russians, Britons and Italians on luxury goods. Now, following the terror attacks in Paris and Brussels and amid signs that Chinese visitors are feeling slightly less at ease in Europe, Italy has become the first European capital to take an extra step to try to accommodate these wealthy patrons. For the next two weeks a small group of Chinese police officers, wearing the same uniforms they wear at home, will be patrolling the streets of Rome and Milan alongside Italian counterparts, ostensibly so that they can present a familiar face to visiting tourists from China who, for example, have had a run-in with a pickpocket at Termini railway station or got lost on their way to the Colosseum. After all, said Italy’s chief of police, Alessandro Pansa, all it took was one lost document to make a tourist feel vulnerable. Italy’s interior minister, Angelino Alfano, was gushing with praise for the new arrangement at a press conference this week, even as he pointed out that crime and murder rates in Italy were at an all-time low. In a statement that could be deemed controversial coming from the most senior official in charge of Italy’s internal security, Alfano said the move was noteworthy for “breaking the old paradigm” in which policing was seen as an issue of national sovereignty. He said Chinese tourists “would have been protected anyway, but now they will feel even more protected”. The bigger question is whether this temporary arrangement – which will also involve Italian officers going to China “in the future” – will pave the way for closer collaboration on other law enforcement issues, including tackling organised crime within Italy’s Chinese community. Before the policing initiative was formally unveiled, one of Italy’s leading daily newspapers, Corriere della Sera, reported that the goal of the collaboration was to help Italian officers break through a culture of silence in the Chinese community’s dealings with the police. Federico Varese, an expert on international organised crime at Oxford University, said that in Italy there were immigrant communities that were known to be reluctant to report crimes and develop relationships with the police. “Instead, if there is a crime or something goes wrong, members of that community go to local people who have authority,” he said. “It is important for authorities to bring people back into the fold and not allow these other people to emerge as community leaders, but it is difficult.” One area of concern is the ties between Chinese organised crime and the ‘Ndrangheta mafia, which is based in Calabria. While the ‘Ndrangheta are known for trafficking cocaine in Europe, Varese said cheap and illegal Chinese goods were also known to be imported into Italy through hubs controlled by the notoriously brutal mafia. Bringing in Chinese police could be a good idea, Varese said, even though it also raised possible questions about civil liberties given China’s record on human rights. He suggested the move could be seen as an affront to Chinese dissidents living in Italy, though no specific criticism has been aired publicly. The Italian government has dropped hints that the relationship with Chinese authorities could develop further. Pansa, the chief of police, said the policing initiative could open the door to other collaboration, including pooling resources to confront criminal elements and terrorist threats that require international cooperation. “For the future, we don’t know how it will develop, because this will be a political choice that has to be taken,” said a spokeswoman for the interior ministry. The simple goal for now was to help tourists, though they were not actually in danger, she added. Jan Gaspers, head of research at the European China policy unit at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Germany, said it was unlikely that the police swap was aimed at organised crime. Instead, he said, it was probably an attempt to address domestic politics in China, where the government is under pressure to show it is doing everything it can to protect Chinese citizens abroad, especially after the death of 24-year-old Frank Deng, a Chinese citizen killed in the Brussels attacks. “Looking at Italy and France, these are top destinations for Chinese tourists, so there is also pressure on them to do something and I can see why Italians would find it attractive,” he said. A similar scheme was proposed and developed in France in 2014 but was never executed. Gaspers said a potential downside, which he believed had prompted France to pull out of the similar scheme, was that it might not send the right message to have foreign police patrolling one’s own streets, even if, as in this case, they did not wield any real authority. For Italy, apparently, the €229bn that Chinese tourists spend abroad each year was a stronger pull.",REAL
David Cameron announces concessions on child refugees,"Councils will be contacted next week and told they should be prepared to accept unaccompanied refugee children from Greece, Italy and France, after David Cameron climbed down on the issue in parliament. MPs were told that local authorities could be asked to provide homes to 3,000 children, but Downing Street denied that a figure had been agreed, and councils revealed that each child would cost £50,000 to resettle. The prime minister’s U-turn quashed a growing rebellion among Conservative MPs who were prepared to vote against their government in favour of an amendment by a Labour peer, Alf Dubs. Tory politicians who have been vocal about the issue, including Heidi Allen, David Burrowes and Stephen Phillips, all welcomed the climbdown and were told by ministers that the work would start straight away. Lord Dubs, who came to Britain as a refugee through the Kindertransport, had been leading the campaign for the UK to accept 3,000 children from European camps. His first attempt was voted down by Conservative MPs but the peer resubmitted the amendment without a specific figure attached, which Cameron said he was now willing to accept. The prime minister said the government would speed up the process of accepting children with direct family links in the UK and would provide homes for others who arrived in Europe before the deal between the EU and Turkey over handling the refugee crisis. “No country has done more than Britain to help when it comes to Syrian refugees. But I do want us to proceed with as much support across the house as I can,” Cameron told MPs. But he added: “I think it is right to stick to the principle that we shouldn’t be encouraging people to make this dangerous journey. I think it is right to stick to the idea that we invest in the refugee camps in the neighbouring countries.” The Tory leader was careful not to mention numbers but his immigration minister, James Brokenshire, told potential Tory rebels that councils had given homes to around 3,000 unaccompanied children last year. The Guardian understands that he hinted that they might be asked to resettle thousands more children but Home Office sources said no number had been agreed. The Local Government Association (LGA) said councils had a strong record of supporting refugees but said they wanted clarification on the long-term funding arrangements and how children would be dispersed across the country. Cllr David Simmonds, chairman of the LGA’s refugees task group, said: “It is vital that the scheme announced today is fully aligned, and funded, alongside this and other existing programmes for resettling refugees, ensuring that councils are able to properly support these vulnerable children while continuing to provide vital services for their local community.” Allen described the climbdown as “brilliant news”. She said the decision to only take children who arrived before the Turkey deal was a “slightly artificial line in the sand” but she understood that ministers wanted to send a clear message to traffickers. “We are not letting anyone wiggle out of any commitments and I have every confidence that the government will honour its commitments,” she added. Phillips, who spent the day meeting refugee children at camps in Athens with the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, said: “The announcement from number 10 today will give these children hope after all they have suffered.” He had described this as the “greatest migration challenge since the second world war” and had been vocal in his opposition to the government’s reluctance to accept more children. Burrowes added that the details would have to be carefully examined and scrutinised but said it would mean Britain was leading the way. The move means the government will not face any rebellion over the issue but it is still being pressed over another Lords amendment calling for a ban on pregnant women being held in immigration detention. Conservative MPs want to see their ministers at least concede that detention will only be used as a last resort. Cooper was also pleased that the decision made in London could have a positive impact on the lives of the children in the Greek UN camp. “There are 35 unaccompanied children here who have no proper shelter and are at risk. The ones who are most at risk aren’t even in the camps or the shelters. There are so many children who are not in proper school or in proper accommodation,” she said. Save the Children’s chief executive, Tanya Steele, said the charity welcomed “today’s significant announcement that the UK will offer them sanctuary and the chance to build a new life here”. “Refugee children, many of whom have fled war and persecution, and have made dangerous journeys to Europe alone are now living on the streets, in overcrowded camps or locked in police detention,” she said.",REAL
Child refugees: Cameron retreat avoids Tory revolt and numbers game,"David Cameron has for the first time conceded the principle that lone child refugees who have travelled to Europe but who do not have any direct family connection to the UK should be given sanctuary in Britain. The prime minister has been willing to pay that price to avoid the risk of rebellious Conservative MPs – who may have included former cabinet ministers such as Sir Eric Pickles – rejecting the government’s refusal to let child refugees already in Europe into Britain. By accepting a second amendment to the immigration bill from the Labour peer Lord Dubs – who has proposed a resettlement plan for the refugees – the government has also avoided having to make a specific commitment on the numbers of extra child refugees brought to Britain due to the concession. Instead, that number, whether it is in the hundreds or thousands, will be determined by talks between the government and local authorities. But the track record so far is not promising. Repeated appeals by Kent and Croydon, whose social services are already under strain, to other local councils to share responsibility, have largely fallen on deaf ears, while Home Office attempts to get a voluntary dispersal scheme under way have faltered. One alternative might be for the government finally to take up the offer from thousands of members of the public to house refugees themselves. Ministers have so far rejected this option on the grounds that those brought directly from the Middle East camps would be the most vulnerable and would need experienced foster families to handle their complex needs. But now Cameron has conceded that lone child refugees in Europe should get sanctuary in Britain, it should be the time to revisit those offers. Save the Children says that 10,000 people have offered places under the Homes for Refugees scheme and they can be given foster training to look after the child victims of war and persecution. If the limit to numbers Britain can take is to be determined by the generosity of the public then there is no reason why those given sanctuary could not far exceed in number the original 3,000 figure proposed. Lord Dubs, a Kindertransport child, was forced to drop the 3,000 figure in his original amendment under the threat of it being declared a money measure so unable to be insisted upon again by the Lords once rejected by the Commons. The fine print means that no one who arrived in Europeafter 23 March, when the EU-Turkey deal on asylum was struck, will be eligible for the new scheme. So traffickers will not be able to use it to “advertise” the UK as a new destination to people in north Africa. It is also likely that most child refugees will come from Italy and Greece rather than the Calais camps. Cameron may think he has minimised the potential numbers involved by accepting an unspecified commitment, but there is no reason why its open-ended nature should not mean more refugees get sanctuary rather than fewer. However, within 20 minutes of Cameron announcing his concession on child refugees, his immigration minister, James Brokenshire, was telling MPs that Britain intended an “opt-out” and refusal to take part in the EU’s reformed asylum rules. At heart these reforms would mean other EU member states being committed to taking an allocation of asylum seekers, under a “fairness mechanism”, from countries like Italy and Greece which have had asylum flows 150% above normal levels. What all this means is that while Cameron has agreed to take a further unspecified number of lone child refugees, he has also firmly set his face against Britain doing its bit to tackle the European refugee crisis.",REAL
Man jailed over Libor seeks 'miscarriage of justice' review,"Tom Hayes, serving 11 years for rigging Libor rates, has hired a high-profile lawyer to take his appeal to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates suspected miscarriages of justice. The 36-year-old’s attempt to have his conviction overturned failed although three senior court of appeal judges reduced the sentence from 14 years. He has now hired Karen Todner – who led Gary McKinnon’s case against extradiction to the US on charges of computer hacking – to present a case to the CCRC. Todner, head of crime, regulatory and extradition at Kaim Todner, said: “Because Tom has already appealed his conviction and sentence, the Criminal Cases Review Commission is now Tom’s only hope of achieving justice. “Tom’s family are now in possession of fresh evidence. We believe Tom has a strong case, which our submission to the CCRC will demonstrate,” said Todner. In August, Hayes was found guilty of eight counts of conspiracy to defraud. He was diagnosed with mild Asperger’s syndrome shortly before his 10-week trial last May. Hayes’s family said: “Karen has longstanding expertise in the areas where Tom’s case needs urgent review in order to right this wrong. Tom knew from the moment he met Karen that she understands him and the way he thinks, and that is the single most important thing to him.” It was not immediately clear what fresh evidence had been found but Hayes and his supporters are seeking to raise up to £150,000 via crowdfunding. So far £2,135 has been raised on FundRazr. Hayes, who is in Belmarsh prison, has been ordered to pay £878,806 after a ruling in the Old Bailey that the money was the proceeds of crime. The Serious Fraud Office was seeking up to £2.45m from Hayes.",REAL
Indiana smashes Republican delegate math but changes little for Democrats,"On Tuesday, voters in Indiana selected Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Bernie Sanders to lead them in November’s general election. Indiana was the last major state to vote before California chooses its presidential nominees on 7 June, so its primary was predicted to be pivotal. And boy, was it. Trump is now almost certain to be the Republican presidential nominee – not least because his nearest rival, Ted Cruz, suspended his campaign after the results were announced. And despite Sanders’ win, Hillary Clinton is still on course to be the Democratic nominee. With 98% of the results in for Indiana, here’s a look at how the delegate math is now in favour of Trump and Clinton. Winning 53% of the Hoosier State’s Republican vote, Trump scooped up all 51 available delegates and crossed the 1,000-delegate mark. The New York businessman only needs 190 more delegates to secure the nomination. There are just nine Republican primaries remaining before the party convention in July, with a total of 445 delegates available. Now that Cruz has stepped out of the race, Trump will collect almost all of those delegates. The Cruz campaign had no doubt looked at the math: to have stopped Trump from reaching the finish line, the Texas senator would have had to grab all 172 delegates in California. That feat looked unlikely, given that he was polling 26 percentage points behind Trump in the Golden State. Simply put, Trump’s opponents were less popular than he is. Cruz’s announcement last week that Carly Fiorina would be his running mate appears to have had little effect. In a survey of 3,940 registered voters by Morning Consult, only 18% of Republicans said they more likely to vote for Cruz now he was running with Fiorina, 22% said it made them less likely to vote for Cruz, and 60% said it had “no impact”. Trump’s only remaining opponent, John Kasich, has the support of just one in five Republicans. Trump’s success in Indiana can be attributed to a few factors. The state’s population is 86% white and it has a median household income of $49,000, almost $5,000 less than the national median. Both race and income have been shown to correlate with support for the New York businessman. Now that the Republican nomination is all but a done deal, Trump will begin to use those demographics to calculate his chances of winning in November. Despite Sanders’ surprise victory in Indiana, the Democratic race is fundamentally unchanged – Clinton looks near certain to be the nominee. Sanders finished the night with 52.5% of the vote and 43 delegates. However, Democratic primaries are not winner-takes-all and so Clinton’s vote share in Indiana translated into 37 delegates. In terms of net differences, the only ones that matter in primary races, Sanders only won six extra delegates – and that simply isn’t enough given that Clinton is ahead by 321 pledged delegates and by 481 superdelegates. For the Vermont senator, there is worse to come. To win the nomination, Sanders needs to capture around two-thirds of the remaining pledged delegates. But polling shows him trailing in Montana, New Jersey and, crucially, California. California will be decisive in the Democratic race, since it offers 546 delegates. Sanders will need to win the majority to have a chance of securing the nomination, but he has an approximately nine-point gap to close on Clinton. Despite this, it seems unlikely that Sanders will drop out of the Democratic race until he has no choice. And there seems to be party consensus that this is a good thing – a poll released this week by NBC News and Survey Monkey found that 57% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters want Sanders to stay in the race until the convention. Given the size of Trump’s and Clinton’s leads, it’s likely both candidates will begin to turn their attention away from the remaining primary elections and towards the upcoming national election. Current polling suggests that Clinton has an average lead of six percentage points over Trump.",REAL
What is Sanders’ route to the Democratic nomination?,"Despite Bernie Sanders’ surprise victory in Indiana, the Democratic race is fundamentally unchanged – Hillary Clinton looks near-certain to be the nominee. To reverse his fortunes, Sanders has to prove the polls wrong. A lot wrong. To pick up the 973 pledged delegates he needs to cross the finish line, Sanders will need to win every remaining Democratic primary. Polling however suggests he might not win any. The Vermont senator needs to capture about two-thirds of the remaining pledged delegates. No numbers are available for the primaries that will be held in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Oregon and Kentucky, partly because pollsters know the voters there won’t change the political calculus much – they’re not “wasting” their time in places with few delegates available. But where opinion polls are available, they show Sanders trailing Clinton in New Jersey and, crucially, California. Just as for Republicans, California will be decisive in the Democratic race since it offers 546 delegates. Sanders will need to win the majority to have a chance of securing the nomination but he has an approximately nine percentage point gap to close on Clinton. And in New Jersey, he will have to erase Clinton’s 16 percentage point lead, then overtake her by at least 16 percentage points (and all that in a month: the state votes on 7 June). Sanders finished Tuesday night with 52.5% of the vote and 43 delegates. However, Democratic primaries are not winner-takes-all and so Clinton’s vote share in Indiana translated into 37 delegates. In terms of net differences, the only ones that matter in primary races, Sanders only won six extra delegates – and that simply isn’t enough given that Clinton is ahead by 321 pledged delegates and by 481 superdelegates.

Dugdale: antisemitism row damaging Scottish Labour's election hopes,"Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, has admitted the furore over antisemitism within Labour after Ken Livingstone’s remarks last week has damaged her party’s chances in Thursday’s Scottish parliament election. With Scottish Labour neck and neck with the Tories in Holyrood polling, Dugdale told the Guardian that voters were raising the controversy on the doorstep in the final days of the campaign. “It has unquestionably had an effect. I’m not going to go into the business of analysing what has happened over the past few days but it is coming up on the doorsteps,” she said, as she campaigned in the target seat of Edinburgh Southern. Her disclosure came as all the Scottish party leaders launched their final push for votes before election day, with Nicola Sturgeon addressing Scottish National party supporters near the statue of former first minister Donald Dewar in central Glasgow. Sturgeon, who is thought to fear her party may not win an overall majority despite the SNP’s substantial lead in the polls, urged her supporters to cast both their constituency and list votes for the SNP. Calling on them to ignore appeals from the pro-independence Scottish Greens to give them their second votes, Sturgeon said SNP voters should “leave nothing to chance”. She appealed for “a personal mandate as first minister to reform and to transform Scotland for the future”. Labour strategists fear the antisemitism row, which dominated media coverage last week after Livingstone, the former London mayor, was confronted by Labour MP John Mann, has severely hit their bid to hold Eastwood constituency near Glasgow. The seat, which mirrors the former East Renfrewshire seat lost last year by the former Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy, is home to Scotland’s largest Jewish community and has been held by Labour’s Ken Macintosh since Dewar established the Scottish parliament in 1999. It is seen as a three-way marginal, and a potential gain for the Scottish Tories, whose recent surge in the polls is now threatening to knock Labour into third place. The loss of Eastwood would badly dent Labour’s hopes of remaining Holyrood’s second largest party. Some constituency Labour parties have seen members resign over the controversy. Insisting she was going to “keep smiling”, Dugdale said she had chosen not to raise it in a phonecall with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, on Tuesday because it “would not have added anything” to her update on the Scottish campaign. She added: “I’m going to carry on doing what I have always done in this campaign, which is to make a positive case for how we can use the powers of the Scottish parliament to make different choices from the Tories in Scotland.” In parallel developments, the SNP barred a Muslim leader in Edinburgh, Amjed Hussain, from further party events for allegedly posting offensive anti-Jewish material on Facebook. Although not a party member, Hussain was photographed with Sturgeon at her manifesto launch and has campaigned for the SNP. Scottish Labour then suspended councillor Terry Kelly in Renfrewshire after the Conservative blogger Guido Fawkes disclosed allegedly antisemitic posts dating back to 2010 which attacked the “Jewish lobby” in the US. Both the Tories and the Liberal Democrats believe they will increase their number of seats at Holyrood. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, launched her final day push at Edinburgh’s Royal Botanic Garden. Appealing to new voters who were born after Scotland won devolution in 1999 to back the Tories, Davidson said: “The devolution generation deserves better. [As] our country’s strong opposition we’ll make sure Scotland gets the better government is deserves.” Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said his party was confident the final result would confound the party’s poor opinion poll showing. “Everywhere I go, people tell me that they are pleased that we are talking about big issues like education that were neglected while the SNP campaigned for independence,” he said.",REAL
'We're like second-class citizens': Flint's struggle continues as Obama visits,"Since 12-year-old Flint resident Jeremiah Loren contracted a debilitating bacterial infection that has rankled his stomach, his grades have dropped dramatically, he’s missed four months of school this year, and there are days he doesn’t even get out of bed. Jeremiah, who has tested positive for elevated blood lead levels, first contracted the infection a few months after Flint switched its water supply to a corrosive local river. His mother, Tammy Loren, attributes his illness directly to the Michigan city’s contaminated water supply. “There’s no other way for him to [have] contracted it,” she said. “He has abdominal pains so bad where he can’t get up out of bed. He’s constantly fatigued and dizzy.” As Barack Obama treks north to Flint on Wednesday at the behest of an eight-year-old resident, he’ll be greeted by a city ensnared in a cascade of ongoing issues similar to the Lorens’. The water crisis, now entering its third year, has done more than shatter residents’ trust in their government; there are potentially long-term health consequences, a lack of funding to remove the network of lead piping, and an unnerving reliance on bottled water, as officials have yet to declare it’s safe for residents to drink their tap water without a filter. “They don’t give a damn about us and they ain’t been giving a damn about us,” said Nayyirah Shariff, 39, an activist and member of the Flint Democracy Defense League. “Like we’re a poor community, so they’re like screw poor people … screw people of color? They just don’t give a damn.” Republican governor Rick Snyder, who first publicly admitted six months ago that Flint residents had been exposed to high levels of lead in the water supply, has repeatedly apologized for his administration’s role in the crisis but has sought to distance himself from criticism for his months-long delay. On Monday, the governor traveled to Flint – without notifying the public – to meet a restaurant owner and speak about what had been accomplished to address the crisis. But two years after a Snyder-appointed emergency manager oversaw the city’s transition to drawing its water from the the Flint river, prompting widespread complaints about discolored and smelly water, residents say the effort has been wholly inadequate. What’s more, they say, there remains a disconnect from the needs of the majority-black city, where more than 40% of residents live below the poverty line. “For me, the way that you act, it determines your values and what you hold important,” Shariff said. “The fact there still hasn’t been a proper response to this is absolutely insulting. We’re just like second-class citizens.” Flint’s water supply became contaminated with lead in April 2014, after the source of the city’s drinking water was switched from Lake Huron to the Flint river. Water from the Flint river had for months corroded lead from inside of water pipes before flowing into households across the city. Nearly $70m has so far been appropriated by the state to reconnect Flint with Detroit’s water system, conduct testing for lead and provide bottled water to residents. The governor activated the national guard to assist in the state’s response. An additional $165m has been proposed for further measures and a federal declaration of a state of emergency meant $5m in additional federal aid. Snyder said on Tuesday that he expected the state legislature to approve expanded Medicaid coverage for children and adults up to age 21, but lawmakers have delayed approving the measure for more than two months. Other residents pointed to the lack of bottled water delivery to homes, forcing many to amend their daily routine to travel to pick up bottled water at fire stations across the city. “If they really wanted to have an authentic response, [then] why do we have to drive around and get water?” said Shariff. “Why do they wait over two months for Medicaid expansion.” One of the major priorities of Flint mayor Karen Weaver has been replacing all of the lead pipes in the city to prevent leaching from those that have been irreparably corroded. Flint has replaced lead service lines for 33 homes since Weaver launched a local effort in March, and officials are preparing efforts for 400 additional homes, said Kristin Moore, spokesperson for Weaver’s office. But Weaver estimates the city would need $55m that it doesn’t have to complete pipe replacement. Snyder told reporters this week that the state is “going to continue to help get the lead service lines out”, and about $2m has been appropriated for the effort – enough to remove about 500 lines in a city that has been estimated to have about 15,000. “The city has been waiting for state and federal lawmakers to pass bills that would cover the $55m cost of replacing every lead-tainted service line in Flint,” said Moore. “It no doubt would lower the per-home cost to replace the pipes if contractors were bidding on $55m worth of work rather than $2m.” Though Obama’s visit has created a glimmer of optimism, some believe the trip should have occurred months ago. The president was in Detroit for the North American International Auto Show in January, where he addressed the “terrible tragedy” of Flint. “I feel like Obama should’ve been here,” said Nakiya Wakes, 40, a resident and activist. “It took a little girl to write him for him to come.” Shariff agreed, but said the president’s visit speaks volumes about Michigan’s governor, who has yet to hold a public forum to meet with residents impacted by the crisis. “What does it say that Obama lives in the White House in DC, and he can meet with Flint residents before Snyder can?” she said. “And he lives 40 minutes away in Ann Arbor.” It’s the role of Snyder, who installed a succession of four emergency managers to address Flint’s finances, that draws the most vocal criticism in the city of 100,000. The governor has rebuffed calls to resign, even as the crisis prompted a recall petition. The 57-year-old former venture capitalist, who won the 2010 gubernatorial race without ever having served in office, has attempted to pin blame for the crisis on “career bureaucrats” who interpreted federal lead regulations too narrowly. But a Snyder-appointed taskforce reviewing what happened in Flint found, in March, that the state’s role was the most significant in causing the crisis. The report highlighted the numerous instances when Snyder’s top aides expressed alarming concerns about Flint’s water supply, long before the governor acknowledged it wasn’t safe for Flint residents to drink. The delayed response in conducting a timely review of the system could result in a $1bn price tag from multiple lawsuits that have been filed at the state and federal level. Civil fines may also be levied as a result of an investigation by Michigan’s attorney general, who has already charged two state environmental officials and a Flint employee with multiple felonies. The investigation, along with nearly a dozen other probes, is still pending. Snyder tapped more than $1m in public funds for criminal and civil attorneys to assist in his office’s response to the litigation and public records requests, but his spokesperson has said there won’t be a “need” for a criminal defense. Snyder has been chided by critics for using public funds in that capacity, especially as Flint residents call for additional funding to address the water crisis. “He may be the singularly most tone deaf politician that I have ever known in my career,” said Flint’s congressional representative, Dan Kildee. “Because I don’t know what’s in his heart. But based on what he says and what he does, he just doesn’t get it. This is a community in crisis, and what we don’t need is an accountant’s calculation as to the minimum amount of support that he can provide.” The governor is expected to meet with Obama on Wednesday, according to his spokesperson. Details have yet to be confirmed. Snyder has tried to encourage Flint residents in recent weeks that tap water is safe to drink, if filtered, by drinking the city’s water himself. But for Wakes, the move has her feeling déjà vu - Flint’s former mayor uttered a similar refrain last summer, as the city’s lead contamination slowly emerged. Wakes recently had her water tested by members of a nonprofit founded by actor Mark Ruffalo – tests that revealed substantially higher levels of lead than what Michigan’s environmental department found at her home. “We don’t know what we’ve been consuming in these few years that we’ve been drinking this, besides lead, so how can y’all say that the water is safe?” Wakes said.",REAL
BAE chairman to peace activists: 'weapons sales encourage peace',"The chairman of BAE Systems has claimed his company’s weapons sales encourage peace, as he responded to questions from peace activists who infiltrated the arms maker’s shareholder meeting. Sir Roger Carr was forced on the defensive by a salvo of questions probing BAE’s dealings with Saudi Arabia, which is currently at war in Yemen. According to a UN panel, Saudi forces have conducted “widespread and systematic” attacks on civilian targets. In response to one such question, Carr said: “We are not here to judge the way that other governments work, we are here to do a job under the rules and regulations we are given.” He insisted that Saudi Arabia, as a crucial ally to Britain, was an entirely appropriate customer for BAE’s weapons and services. All sales by BAE were in accordance with rules and regulations set out by the UK government, he repeatedly said. “We will stop doing it when they tell us to stop doing it,” Carr added. Peace activists dominated the meeting, repeatedly asking the BAE board to give their moral justification for supplying weapons to countries accused of human rights abuses. Others urged the board to switch their business to finding solutions to climate change, water shortages and other environmental problems. When one questioner argued that lasting peace can only be achieved through negotiations, Carr replied: “There is, however, in the world in which we all live, the principle of speaking softly but carrying a big stick – and that very often encourages people to negotiate. “We try and provide our people, our government, our allies with the very best weapons, the very best sticks they can have, to encourage peace.” At another point, Carr said his ethical justification was “in our belief that what we are doing is in the interests of peace for the world, rather than simply as aggressors. We maintain peace by having the ability to make war and that has stood the test of time. “We are a defence company and I have tried to give you clearly and openly the rules under which we operate – not hide behind – and the belief that we have as individuals which allows us to do this work in a proud and positive way, rather than with a sense of shame.” At the beginning of the meeting, after two activists were carried out for holding up placards, Carr acknowledged the presence of protesters. “Some of you will have genuine reservations about both what we do and where we do it,” he said. “As always there will be an opportunity to put questions to the board and I and my team will seek to respond clearly and courteously to any question you pose. Whilst we may not always agree, I’m certain that mutual respect and good manners will always produce the most valuable exchanges.” Carr only appeared to lose his temper when one shareholder said: “Your defence reminds me of the IG Farben defence at the Nuremberg tribunals.” It was an IG Farben subsidiary that made the Zyklon B gas used to murder Jews and others in Nazi concentration camps during the second world war. “Can I just say to you, sir, how grossly offensive I find that and to every member sitting on this board,” Carr replied. After more than an hour of hostile questions, Carr asked shareholders to come forward to change the subject. When one man raised the inadequacy of the venue’s sound system, Carr replied: “I’m sorry you hadn’t heard the questions. Actually there were some questions I wish I hadn’t heard.” Towards the end, organisers resorted to switching off the microphones when people whom they identified as activists took to the lectern. About 30 activists affiliated to the Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) had bought shares in BAE to gain access to the AGM. They brought placards with quotes from people enduring bombardments in Yemen, which they held up to display to other shareholders. Some dressed in black and wore red gloves and funeral-style black veils. On Tuesday another peace group, Sisters Against the Arms Trade, blockaded a missile factory owned by MBDA, in which BAE has a 37.5% stake. Fifteen women and non-binary people blocked the gates of the site in Bedford before the start of the day to stop workers from entering. MBDA produces the Brimstone missile and other precision-guided weapons, which are used by both Saudi and Emirati forces in their campaign against Yemen’s Houthi rebels. On the same day, a committee of MPs said it was “deeply disappointing” that the UK government had ignored alleged breaches of humanitarian law in Yemen. “The failure by the parties to the conflict to account for their actions appears to have contributed to an ‘anything goes’ attitude by both sides,” said a report by the international development select committee.",REAL
"One in six cleaners, childcare helpers in California paid below minimum wage","One in six employers of domestic workers fails to pay the minimum wage in California, according to unprecedented research on workers who are often left behind when cities and states reform labor laws and raise wages. In the first study of its kind on an industry that typically avoids scrutiny, researchers with the University of California Los Angeles Labor Center found that out of two million domestic employers in the state – those who hire people for house cleaning, home care support and childcare – roughly 17% violate the minimum wage law. That means as many as 340,000 workers could be making below minimum wage, according to the report published on Wednesday, which was shared exclusively with the Guardian and marks the first comprehensive survey of domestic work employers in the state. “It’s an industry and a workforce that was historically left out of labor protections and labor policy,” said Saba Waheed, research director of the UCLA Labor Center and co-author of the study. “Socially and culturally, it’s a type of work that isn’t always valued.” Although previous research has analyzed the experiences of domestic workers, the report – titled Profile, Practices, and Needs of California’s Domestic Work Employers – is the first large-scale survey of the people who hire these workers, with findings based on responses from a randomly selected pool of 501 people. The report, which found that 16% of all households in California hire domestic workers in their homes, comes as cities and states across the country are moving to increase their minimum wages and provide mandatory sick days and parental leave. With California and New York passing legislation to gradually raise their statewide minimum wages to $15 an hour and Oregon passing a similar measure, advocates say it is crucial that workers in industries that operate underground and frequently violate labor protections are not excluded from the new benefits. The surveys, conducted from October 2015 to January 2016, found that 17% of domestic employers in California paid below the minimum wage, which was $9 per hour in 2015 and increased to $10 per hour this year. Five percent paid rates matching the minimum wage and 17% paid “low wages” of $9.01 to $13.83 an hour. Out of an estimated 380,000 childcare employers, 42% were paying below minimum wage, according to the report. Additionally, although a small percentage of employers said they had domestic employees work overtime, almost none of them properly paid them for those hours. Unlike some companies that willfully exploit vulnerable low-wage workers, the minimum wage violations in domestic work are largely tied to the informal nature of the industry and the fact that, as the study found, a majority of employers pay some kind of flat rate instead of hourly wages, according to Waheed. “It’s a symptom of the lack of structures in the industry,” she said. “Employers may not even know they’re not paying the minimum wage … You have to think about your home as a workplace.” The report more broadly highlights the ways in which people across a wide range of demographics are increasingly relying on domestic work – with low-income households representing 44% of all domestic employers. Some employers are “not poor enough to get access to certain subsidies, but then are not making enough to be able to afford the home care support they need”, Waheed said. While low-income employers tend to pay lower wages or below the minimum required by law, 21% of moderate- or high-income employers also pay workers low wages, according to the report. The data highlights the need for states to expand and enforce industry labor protections and develop mechanisms to enforce basic labor laws for workers in homes, the report said. Although wage violations against domestic workers appear to be rampant, employees infrequently file complaints, according to data provided by Paola Laverde, spokeswoman for California’s department of industrial relations. In 2015, domestic workers filed 230 wage claims across the state – a small fraction of the nearly 30,000 total claims that year, she said. “My experience in the employers I come across is that they want to be treating the workers fairly,” said Lindsay Imai Hong, an organizer with Hand in Hand, a national association of domestic employers, which encourages people to sign a “fair care pledge”, saying they will pay cleaners and other home workers fair wages and offer paid time off. “For some, it really is an education issue,” she said. “A lot of families don’t have the resources either of time or of information to go about learning how to become a fair employer in their home.” The report also calls for stronger public investments in childcare and home-care programs and policies – so that low-income families can access the domestic support they need and employees can have better working conditions. Jessica Lehman, executive director of not-for-profit organization Senior and Disability Action, has used a wheelchair all her life and started hiring home attendants when she was 18 years old. “At 18, what did I know about hiring people? At any age, most people don’t think of themselves as a boss and as a supervisor,” said Lehman, a member of the research team behind the report. When employees receive fair wages and have proper working conditions, it can lead to long-term sustainable relationships with employers, Lehman added. “It really hurts everyone if we’re not thinking of it as a real job. When you devalue the work, we’re devaluing ourselves as seniors, people with disabilities, as parents, as people who really depend on workers.”",REAL
"Next's view of consumer demand: dunno, guv","Here is Next’s considered opinion on the current state of consumer demand, derived from a detailed analysis of its own trading in the past six weeks: “Dunno, guv, we only sell clothes and stuff.” The chief executive, Lord Wolfson, didn’t put it like that, of course. Instead there was a worthy discourse on the effect of weather (cold in March and April versus last year’s hot Easter) on recent weeks’ weak sales followed by a confession that the real problem may just be that consumers are spending less. Amid the uncertainty, Next reckons its sales this year could fall by 3.5% but might rise by the same percentage. Put another way, pre-tax profits could decrease 8.9% to £748m or could improve 3.7% to £852m. The odd part is the market regarded this finger-in-the-air exercise as mildly reassuring – Next’s shares rose 5%. In a sense, though, it is. Widening the range of possible profit outcomes from £74m in March to £104m is unusual, but the key conclusion is surely that Next doesn’t expect to come apart at the seams, whatever happens. The low-end profit figure of £748m is hardly a disaster. Not all retailers could confidently claim to be so resilient, especially if it’s true that consumer confidence has turned down. In the long term, Next faces the problem of combating competitors who seem to have learned and copied all its best online distribution and logistics tricks. An upgrade is required for the online and catalogue Directory business, as Next admits. The short-term headaches, though, seem more irritating than painful.",REAL
PM challenges Jeremy Corbyn over links to antisemitic extremists,"David Cameron has used prime minister’s questions to relentlessly challenge the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, over his links to extremist groups with antisemitic views. The prime minister turned the weekly session on its head as he ignored Corbyn’s questions about domestic policy and instead demanded four times that he withdraw remarks relating to Hamas and Hezbollah. “I’m afraid he is going to have to do this one more time,” Cameron said, in front of cheering Conservative MPs, who will hope the attack can maximise the party’s chances in tomorrow’s elections. “He referred to Hamas and Hezbollah as his friends – are they your friends or not? “Because those organisations in their constitutions believe in persecuting and killing Jews, they are antisemitic organisations, they are racist organisations, he must stand up and say they are not his friends.” Corbyn repeatedly responded by saying Labour was an anti-racist party that would not tolerate antisemitism, but failed to directly withdraw his previous comments about Hamas and Hezbollah. Instead, he said that he did not approve of either organisation, adding: “Anyone who commits racist acts or is antisemitic is not a friend of mine.” On the eve of the mayoralty elections in London, Cameron also laid into the Labour candidate, Sadiq Khan, who he accused of a “pattern of behaviour” in sharing platforms with individuals with extremist views. “He shared a platform with Sajil Shahid, the man who trained the ringleader of the 7/7 attacks and accused the US of bringing 9/11 on themselves. He shared a platform with an extremist who called for Jews to be drowned in the ocean.” Shahid has reportedly called for violence against British troops and run a training camp in Pakistan where known terrorists learned how to make bombs and fire rocket-propelled grenades. One of his “graduates” was said to be Mohammad Sidique Khan, who led the gang of four suicide bombers on the deadliest terrorist attack ever committed in Britain on 7 July 2005. Corbyn hit back, accusing Cameron of smearing Khan, and pointing out that Sulaiman Ghani, who the prime minister previously highlighted as an extremist with links to the Labour mayoral hopeful, had also been pictured with the Conservative candidate, Zac Goldsmith. Cameron said Khan had appeared with Ghani nine times, and said he was a man who described women as subservient to men and who expressed unsavoury views about gay people. Cameron’s attack came after Corbyn became engulfed in an antisemitism crisis after his close political ally, Ken Livingstone, made controversial remarks about Hitler and Israel that resulted in him being suspended from the party. The Labour leader, who was accused of failing to act quickly enough in suspending his friend, set up an inquiry into antisemitism led by the former Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti.",REAL
Woman who defied 300 neo-Nazis at Swedish rally speaks of anger,"The lone protest of a woman defying a march of 300 uniformed neo-Nazis is set to become an iconic image of resistance to the rise of the far-right in Scandinavia. A photograph of Tess Asplund, 42, with fist raised against the leadership of the Nordic Resistance Movement (NRM) in Borlänge, central Sweden, on Sunday has gone viral in the country. “It was an impulse. I was so angry, I just went out into the street,” Asplund told the Guardian. “I was thinking: hell no, they can’t march here! I had this adrenaline. No Nazi is going to march here, it’s not okay.” After joining a large counter-demonstration she took the train back to Stockholm and did not think about what happened until Monday evening, when the photograph spread on social media. “Now it’s a circus. I am in shock,” said Asplund, who is 5ft 3in and weighs just 50kg (eight stone). “The Nazis are very angry, so I am a little ‘Oh shit, maybe I shouldn’t have done that, I want peace and quiet.’ These guys are big and crazy. It’s a mixed feeling, but I am trying to stay calm.” Asplund’s lone protest comes at a time when the far-right in Sweden is increasing its activities, according to Daniel Poohl of Expo, the anti-racist foundation in Stockholm, whose photographer David Lagerlöf captured the image. The anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats party polls between 15% and 20% and holds the balance of power in parliament, while racist sentiments are fuelled by a fragmented landscape of internet hate sites. The avowedly antisemitic National Socialists of the NRM are the extreme wing of this spectrum, Poohl says. “We live in a Europe where far-right ideas are becoming more popular, and there is also a reaction against them. It is a time when people are longing for something to channel their urge to resist the Europe that builds borders against refugees, the Europe that cannot cooperate any more. Tess has captured one of the conflicts of our time,” he said. Swedish media have compared the photograph to a famous image from 1985 known as tanten med väskan, “the lady with the bag”. The image, taken by Hans Runesson, shows a woman hitting a skinhead from the Nordic Reich party with her bag. The picture of Asplund is in many senses more powerful in the Swedish context today, Poohl says. “We now live in a multicultural society, so it makes sense that it was a black woman.” Swedish civil society is working hard to settle tens of thousands of refugees from the Middle East and Asia who sought asylum in the country last year, but there has been a spate of arson attacks on refugee accommodation, and the government has toughened up its asylum policies. The NRM is known for targeting anti-racists, says Asplund. “I have friends who have been attacked by them and who have had to change their address. I have had calls at night from private numbers, screaming at me. It is hard to talk about the hate,” she says. “I feel ashamed that we have this problem. The police say it is a democratic country, so they can demonstrate. But these are Nazis! It is horrible.” Asplund, who describes herself as Afro-Swedish, is unemployed, and active in the group Afrophobia Focus. Sweden was identified by the UN last year as having a particular problem with afrophobia, defined as hostility towards people with a background from sub-Saharan Africa. “Racism has been normalised in Sweden, it’s become okay to say the N-word,” she says, recounting how a man on the subway used the racial slur while shouting and telling her to hurry up. “But nobody paid any attention. I thought Sweden in 2016 would be more open minded, but something has happened,” Asplund says. “I hope something positive will come out of the picture. Maybe what I did can be a symbol that we can do something – if one person can do it, anyone can.”",REAL
Brexit jitters set to weigh on foreign demand for London office space,"Global investment in London office space remained strong at the start of the year, but is expected to dip in the run-up to the EU referendum next month. A total of £3.5bn was invested in central London in the traditionally subdued first three months of the year, on a par with the same quarter in 2015, according to data from the real estate advisory firm CBRE. The figure was down from £4bn in the fourth quarter of 2015, which was particularly strong. CBRE said there were 43 transactions in the first quarter, the lowest number since 2010. But the number of large deals above £100m hit 14, the highest first-quarter figure since records began in 1985. Among the biggest deals were the government’s £371m sale of a stake in the King’s Cross development to Australia’s largest pension fund, and Great Portland Estates’ sale of Savills’ headquarters to Germany’s Deka Immobilien Investment for £216m. Jamie Pope, the executive director of London capital markets at CBRE, said: “Some investors are experiencing a degree of political and economic uncertainty at the moment, so it’s heartening to report that this hasn’t caused much in the way of turbulence in the London office market in the first quarter of the year. Yields are stable. “Nevertheless, we are already seeing some buyers hold off on deals until they know the result of June’s EU vote, so we expect to see the second quarter’s transaction volumes dip, before bouncing back in the second half of the year, provided Britain stays in the EU.” The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said last week there had been an easing in international demand for UK office, industrial and retail property since the referendum was confirmed last spring. The CBRE said international investors continue to dominate the market and were involved in just over two-thirds (67% of all transactions, down from 71% in the fourth quarter. Taking advantage of the weak pound, they poured more than £2.4bn of investment into London offices. Kevin McCauley, head of London research at CBRE, said Chinese investors, who stayed away after China’s stock market turmoil last summer, returned to the capital towards the end of the year and into 2016 in search of a haven. He said: “London has been the key beneficiary of investors looking to diversify away from risk – economic or social – since at least 2013.” He pointed to transparent pricing and the relative ease of access to the London office market, as well as a shortage of new office space, which means rents are expected to keep growing. “A lot of cities in Asia and mainland Europe and New York are significantly more expensive in yield terms than London is.”",REAL
Trump on road to nomination as Cruz exits Republican race,"Trump, Sanders triumph in Indiana Donald Trump continued his march to the Republican nomination, sweeping Indiana and knocking out Ted Cruz, who suspended his campaign. Trump offered an uncommonly gracious tribute to his departing rival. “I don’t know if he likes me or doesn’t like me,” Trump said of his rival, “but he is one hell of a competitor. He has an amazing future.” Republican party chair Reince Priebus called Trump the “presumptive nominee” as the party swallowed hard and prepared for hostile takeover. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, saw off Hillary Clinton in Indiana in another surprise blow to the establishment candidate, beating her by 53% to 47%. “The Clinton campaign thinks this campaign is over,” Sanders said. “They’re wrong.” But despite Sanders’ 18th victory of 2016, delegate math remains formidably against the Vermont senator. Clinton is already looking toward her Republican opponent, inviting supporters to “chip in now if you agree we can’t let Trump become president”. The Guardian’s delegate tracker shows Clinton is now at 2,202 delegates to Sanders’ 1,400. Trump is at 1,047 to John Kasich’s 153. Cruz bowed out with 565, a hug from Heidi and a wistful: “Together, we left it all on the field in Indiana.” School’s out in Detroit The Detroit teacher “sickout” enters day three.

Deutsche Bahn pushes ahead with plans to float Arriva,"Deutsche Bahn is pushing ahead with plans to float Arriva, its international transport arm that runs many of Britain’s train and bus services, as part of a sell-off to raise an anticipated €4.5bn (£3.6bn) for the ailing German railway group. The supervisory board of the state-owned group is expected to approve plans on Wednesday evening for a part-privatisation of both Arriva, which operates in 14 European countries outside Germany, and the international freight logistics subsidiary DB Schenker. The final decision on an IPO is expected in the autumn, with Deutsche Bahn likely to sell a 45% stake in both. The company is seeking to reduce its €17.5bn debt and invest in modernising German railways. Arriva started operating the Northern rail franchise, one of Britain’s biggest transport networks, last month. It also runs CrossCountry, London Overground, Chiltern and Grand Central trains, and thousands of bus services across the country. The largest rail union said the sale could affect British employees of Arriva or DB Schenker, and services. The RMT’s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “This potential fire sale of a large chunk of DB’s UK rail assets to the same old gang of spivs and speculators has set the alarm bells ringing for all Arriva and DB Schenker staff who once again see their livelihoods traded from under them as nothing more than units on a balance sheet.” He said the flotation exposed the “flakey and unstable nature of rail franchising”, with Deutsche Bahn allowed to win rail contracts and then hold a “corporate car-boot sale without any controls over who is getting a slice of the action”. Rail staff terms and conditions are normally protected when franchises are awarded under TUPE laws, as are passenger services under franchise obligations. An Arriva spokesman said: “Arriva has a strong track record of investment in the UK, investing £549m in the past five years and employing 28,000 people across the country. “Deutsche Bahn is considering a third-party minority holding in Arriva which is intended to continue the successful development of Arriva and enable further investments in future growth.”",REAL
Next warns on sales and profits as cold weather chills spring ranges,"Clothing and homeware retailer Next has cut its guidance for annual sales for the second time in less than two months after a disappointing first quarter of the year. Cold, damp weather in March and April reduced demand for clothing over the past six weeks, Next said. Though sales have improved in the past few days as weather has improved, the company said demand for clothes could stay weak. In the three months to 2 May, Next’s total sales fell by 0.2% and full-price sales dropped 0.9%, at the low end of full-year sales guidance of -1% to +4%. As a result, Next cut its annual guidance for full-price sales to between -3.5% and +3.5%. It slashed its previous guidance in March when Lord Wolfson, the company’s chief executive, predicted this year would be the most difficult since the financial crisis. The company said it was “unlikely but possible” that sales would deteriorate further and the poor performance of the last six weeks could indicate a weaker underlying demand for clothing and potentially a wider consumer slowdown. Wolfson said: “It’s unquestionably a combination of the weather and the economy. It’s difficult to know how much of either it is but the fact that sales are so weather dependent - on warm days sales go up significantly - is an indicator of the economy as people are only buying when they need to.” He said wider economic indicators, such as real earnings and manufacturing output also suggested the UK could be headed for another recession. Next stunned the City in late March when it slashed sales forecasts for the year and predicted tough trading caused by the slowing economy and falling consumer confidence. Wolfson, a keen observer of consumer trends, said this year “may well feel like walking up the down escalator”. Since Wolfson’s warning, other fashion retailers have reported difficult trading amid concerns about the health of the high street and consumer confidence. Primark reported its first fall in half-year sales for 12 years last month and Debenhams has said conditions are difficult. Next said it reduced its forecasts again this week after erratic sales figures over six weeks and that business had picked up significantly as warmer spring weather arrived. The company gives clearer guidance than most big companies and a scheduled trading statement arrived at the end of a particularly weak period. Wolfson that there was clearly a shift in consumer spending away from clothing towards other priorities such as eating out, housing and cars but he didn’t think the shift was permanent or that we had reached “peak stuff”, as some commentators have suggested. “I think that’s an easy conclusion to draw whenever there is a slowdown but these things go in cycles,” said Wolfson. “Because fashion is a crowd activity, if you get a long period where the weather is not appropriate to buying new clothes and you don’t see other people wearing new clothes you are less likely to buy them yourself. It’s very unlikely it’s permanent.” Some analysts have argued that Wolfson, a Tory peer, has used the economy and the weather to cover for Next’s own problems, including the declining performance of its directory catalogue business and under investment in mobile technology - the fastest growing sales route. Wolfson admitted in March that the company had work to do to overhaul its products and systems. On Wednesday, Wolfson said that sales at Next were likely to have been affected by a number of factors beyond the weather including a slight increase in discounting across the high street over Easter. The chain does not offer discounts in its stores except at the end of July and after Christmas. Wolfson said Next had gained from relaunching its mobile website in March and improving product availability for the Directory in recent weeks. James McGregor, a parner at consultancy Retail Remedy, said: “It was inevitable that the weather would feature in some way in Next’s trading update and we have not been disappointed. “If Next have been challenged by the unseasonal weather this season, then we can assume that the majority of fashion retailers are really suffering. Ever cautious, we are not surprised to hear Lord Wolfson warn of difficult trading ahead.” Next shares, which have lost almost a third of their value this year, rose 2.4% in early trading.",REAL
Delhi schools ordered to close early for summer as temperatures soar,"All schools in Delhi have been ordered to take a “mandatory summer vacation” from 11 May amid a heatwave that has swept the city. Officials say temperatures will continue to rise in the coming weeks, after reaching 44C (111F) on Monday – the hottest day of the year so far. Schools in other parts of India have already been forced to close because of heatwaves and a drought that has affected 330 million people across India. Delhi’s state-run schools finish for the summer on 10 May anyway, but private and municipal schools’ term dates vary. Many schools’ end-of-term tests will now need to be rescheduled. Nav Bharti public school was due to break up for the summer on 18 May. Its headteacher, Sanjay Bhartiya, said the government’s decision would cause a scheduling nightmare. “We had cycle tests and unit tests scheduled for the second week of May, so now all our schedule will be disturbed,” he said. “We are going to follow the government’s order, there is no alternative right now. But in the school calendar, one week matters a lot. We understand the government’s concern over the heatwave but this abrupt decision will definitely affect us.” Madhulika Sen, headteacher at Tagore International school, Vasant Vihar, which will lose three working days because of the government’s order, was less forgiving. “Where the temperature is concerned, the government schools have no infrastructure – no fans, no back up for electricity, drinking water. They can’t handle the heatwave, so it makes sense for the government schools to be closed.” “But I don’t know why private schools have been affected because we have all the infrastructure – many schools even have air conditioning. The government just doesn’t want to make it sound as though children in government schools are finishing earlier than private school students,” she said. For some though, the decision is a practical one. Madhurie Singh, the founder of a school comparison website who has two children, said: “The most important thing is health. Distances in Delhi are huge, and kids can spend an hour or more travelling to school. “Over a period of time, the climate is changing, and perhaps it is time to look at how the school year can be restructured around that change.” Extreme weather is becoming increasingly common in India. Last year, hundreds of people died in floods in the southern city of Chennai. The heatwave is adding to the woes of millions of people who are suffering from drought. Weak monsoons for the last two years have forced hundreds of migrants to leave their ancestral lands in search of water in the cities. Rural parts of the country have been hit the worst, with farmers suffering from poor harvests and no clean water to drink or wash. The scarcity of water has caused political tensions, with states in northern India battling over control of rivers. Armed guards have been deployed at dams to protect what is becoming an increasingly precious resource. Earlier this year, rioters in the state of Haryana cut off the water supply to Delhi until the government met their demands to change their caste status. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has promised long-term solutions to drought during election rallies, but so far, government efforts to provide relief to the millions of people in drought-hit regions have been slow and ineffective.",REAL
ITV dips on worries about online competition and falling ad revenues,"ITV has been caught in a two way pull and the bears appear to be winning at the moment. The broadcaster’s shares are down 1.8p at 226.2p, with Deutsche Bank issuing a sell note with a 200p price target, partly on the basis that the competition from mobile and online viewing is beginning to bite. Analyst Laurie Davison said: We are cutting ITV advertising estimates again. It is tempting to point to the EU referendum as causing temporary uncertainty and assume a second half bounceback. But our checks point to three factors, none of which are going away: UK National Living Wage; falling number of adverts being watched from shifting viewing habits and advertisers being more aggressive on pricing. Consensus hopes for a second half recovery are too optimistic. A falling number of adverts being watched is of particular concern as it highlights our concerns for the linear TV ad model, where ITV is most exposed in Europe. ITV stock can fall further; at 10.9 times enterprise value/EBITDA versus more diversified and higher quality US peers at 7-10 times. On advertising, Deutsche said: Our channel checks with media agencies point to continuing deterioration in ITV ad revenues. In March, ITV guided for first quarter flat, and April -5% with a stronger May and June to come from spend in the run-up to Euro2016. Our Media Buyer call in Jan had agency forecasts for the second quarter at +4% to 9%. This has now fallen to +1-2% with April/May/June consensus at -5%/+3%/+7%, but some estimates as low as +5% for June. Ahead of ITV’s first quarter interim management statement on May 12, we cut second quarter from +3% to +1.5% and 2016 from +2.0% to +0.5%, earnings per share falls 3%. And on the growing competion: [The] shift to online viewing is not new, but is starting to bite. Let’s be clear, falling impacts is just one of the three reasons for the cuts. But we still find European investors remarkably sanguine on the growing risks to the linear TV model. The argument that “Europe is different” is right, but Euro TV is more exposed, not less than US entertainment names. ITV is most at risk with the UK seeing most rapid shifts and 75% of earnings from linear ads. Meanwhile Credit Suisse has cut its price target from 296.74p to 270p but kept its outperform rating: We lower our EPS forecasts by -4% for 2016 and 2017 to reflect the weaker expectations for net advertising revenue from UK media buyers. Our new forecasts leave us 1-2% behind consensus earnings per share for 2016. ITV has underperformed EU Media by -15% since the start of the year and we believe that these earnings downgrades will come as no surprise to investors. We believe that weaker net advertising revenue growth and risk surrounding the referendum has been more than priced in and we think that ITV looks attractive on an 8% free cash flow yield despite the risks. We believe that the significant transformation of the business which has reduced reliance on advertising and increased the strategic value of their Studios business means the long term strategic value of ITV is undervalued at current levels.",REAL
UK construction sector reports slowest expansion since mid-2013,"A boom in office building in London has failed to prevent Britain’s construction industry from reporting its worst month in almost three years in April. Firms blamed the decline on a lack of new orders that stemmed from the weaker outlook for the UK economy as a whole. It follows a slump in manufacturing last month that has alarmed economists and fuelled speculation that GDP growth will slow further after dipping to 0.4% in the first quarter. The government is likely to come under pressure to react to the downturn in construction, especially after a run of figures in recent months showing that housebuilders are one of the worst affected groups. George Osborne promised a building boom to tackle the UK’s housing shortage in his 2015 autumn statement, but since then the strength of the sector has begun to wane. The seasonally adjusted Markit/Cips construction purchasing managers’ index (PMI) registered 52 in April – a number over 50 represents growth – and that reading marked three years of sustained output growth across the construction sector. However, Markit, which compiled the survey, said the latest reading was down from 54.2 in March and said April represented the slowest expansion of business activity in the sector since mid-2013. Tim Moore, a senior economist at Markit, said hopes that a slowing of activity in the first quarter would be temporary had now been dashed. “Stalling new order volumes not only set the scene for further weakness ahead, but are already weighing on staff hiring and input buying across the construction sector,” he said. “Softer growth forecasts for the UK economy alongside uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum appear to have provided reasons for clients to delay major spending decisions until the fog has lifted.” He added that the reluctance of housebuilders to develop new plots was one of the biggest drags on future growth. “April’s survey highlighted one of the weakest rises in housing activity since early-2013, suggesting that greater caution in this sub-sector is adding to the sluggish growth conditions seen across the wider construction industry,” he said. The Construction Products Association, which represents suppliers to the industry, recently downgraded its growth forecasts, but only marginally, and it still expects growth to be double the 1.8% forecast for the UK economy. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said the support for housebuilders promised by the chancellor was much needed. He said the chancellor needed to move quickly to implement plans to double the housing budget to more than £2bn a year and to build 400,000 affordable homes by the end of the decade.

Sadiq Khan campaign in overdrive in run-up to London mayoral vote,"It is 1.30pm in west London, and the morning shift workers are spilling out of the Noon prepared foods factory to be met by a small but energetic group of Labour party activists. “Please vote Sadiq Khan on May 5!” says Zahida Abbas Noori again and again, dashing between cars to thrust campaign leaflets through reluctantly opened windows, while other supporters intercept staff members leaving on foot. “Not interested,” says one man, ripping his piece of paper in two as he walks away. Several others among the largely south Asian workforce, split between Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims, pause to scrutinise the leaflet, saying they haven’t decided how to vote. But this area, Southall, is a solidly Labour part of the city, and others give a thumbs up as they leave or a promise that yes, of course, they’re voting for the party’s candidate to replace Boris Johnson as mayor. In the week of London’s mayoral election, one might expect these to be comfortable days for Sadiq Khan’s team. Having pulled ahead of his Tory rival Zac Goldsmith at the start of the year, the Tooting MP has since strengthened and extended his lead, with an Opinium survey for the Evening Standard on Tuesday putting him nine points ahead of Goldsmith, with the gap widening to 14 points after second preferences. But there is no one inside Labour – not least Khan himself, a close ally of Ed Miliband who ran the party’s Westminster campaign in the capital – who does not carry deep scars from the general election a year ago, when the polls were proved humiliatingly wrong on election night. Khan campaign insiders say they believe their man is ahead, but are extremely reluctant to trust the huge reported margin. And so, accepts Kamaljeet Jandu, chair of the party’s black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) executive committee and an active member of Khan’s extended team, all are focussed in the final days on events like this one, and a spirited effort to persuade Labour’s core vote to actually turn up on Thursday. “The polls have him way ahead, and that could translate into: ‘Oh, I don’t need to go out and vote, others are going to do it,’” says Jandu. “That’s my fear. It’s our responsibility to make sure people do get out there.” Though Goldsmith’s campaign has been widely criticised for highly personal attacks on Khan, attempting to link him to “extremists” he has defended as a lawyer or MP, or to paint his own policies as “radical”, some activists will privately admit to encountering some resistance to their Muslim candidate on the doorsteps. That reluctance is most pronounced in outer boroughs where Labour has historically been more vulnerable. In ethnically mixed areas such as Southall, the Conservatives have been spending money on highly targeted leaflets to Indian and Tamil voters, apparently based on surname, telling Hindus that Khan’s party wants to tax their family jewellery and Tamils that Khan “won’t stand up for the Tamil community”. The tactic has been rubbished by many British Indians (“an ill-informed and arrogant mailshot,” wrote one blogger on the website DailySikhUpdates.com) and is met with a certain amount of eye-rolling on the streets of west London. “Oh yes, we have had so many of these leaflets,” laughs Lal Kumar, behind the counter of a womanswear shop on Southall High Street. Does he know how he plans to vote? “We will go for Labour.” US Chada, owner of a shop selling gold and “UK sweaters”, is almost affronted when asked if he thinks attempts to link Khan to controversial Muslim figures will put off his fellow Sikhs or Hindu voters. “I have never discussed this with anybody.” He has a Khan campaign poster in his window but is voting Conservative, he says, because he knows the candidate in his home area of Northwood. The Goldsmith campaign has consistently denied it is exploiting ethnic stereotypes. “I don’t believe it’s been a negative campaign,” says Greg Stafford, leader of the Conservative group on Ealing council. “I think it’s a campaign that has been highlighting a number of [Khan’s] faults, and Sadiq has done exactly the same [about Goldsmith]. I think people are very sceptical about Sadiq’s record.” But will it work? “It is perfectly appropriate to target different types of voters, but when you target leaflets by surname there are pros and cons,” says Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, a non-partisan thinktank looking at issues of integration and identity. “An older, first-generation Indian might like it, but the British-born audience might say, could I not have had the leaflet about the 94 bus instead? “The Conservative strategists might be asking themselves, if they find themselves dog-whistling in a city where there maybe aren’t enough dogs any more.” That may be reflected in Labour’s internal polling, which has not detected any measurable effect of the highly targeted messages, according to a source close to the Khan campaign. But there is a palpable terror of complacency among activists. Sen Kandiah, a Tamil Labour activist, says Goldsmith has greatly misjudged Tamil voters, who he expects to be solidly behind Khan. He admits to concerns, however, that some Hindu or white working-class voters may be more vulnerable to the Tory attacks. “People don’t want to tell you [on the doorstep], but in the ballot box they can do what they want to do. “That is why as a Labour man I am not taking anything for granted. We are working hard until the end in a last push for Sadiq.”",REAL
"Crows swoop on puppy, carrying it away from back garden","The owner of a chihuahua puppy remains hopeful the dog is still alive after it was snatched from her backyard and carried away by crows. Four-month-old Fudge, who was small enough to fit in the palm of a hand, was swooped upon by crows while outside her owner Heather Sinden’s home in Melbourne’s outer east on Wednesday afternoon. Sinden’s daughter Melinda Pride told the Lilydale &amp; Yarra Valley Leader that the dog spent most of its time indoors but had been let outside to urinate. Her mother had seen the crows at the Astor Court address and “was quite concerned”, said Pride. “Then she heard [Fudge] screaming and she was gone.” Sinden – who has lung cancer, and was given the puppy for companionship two months ago – “collapsed from shock”, said Pride. “Mum was only saying a week or so ago ‘if anything happens to this little dog I don’t know what I’ll do’ ... she was very attached to the little dog.” Pride was hopeful that Fudge landed safely. In an interview on local radio, she said members of the community were scouring the area for Fudge. “We’ve had people walking around everywhere; it’s just amazing the feedback we’re getting ... people are going to parks and everything, trying to find her, but there’s no sign of her at all. “We’re just hoping that she may fall from the bird and land safely enough for her to be okay,” Pride said. Calls for Fudge’s safe return have also been made on social media, with Chihuahua Rescue Australia sharing the story on its Facebook page. The thread below the post revealed a precedent for chihuahuas being carried away by birds of prey in Australia. “I have eagles that hang around our house and I have a three-month-old chihuahua; I’m always on the lookout for those buggers,” commented Mandy Knox. Lauren Jackson’s story had a happy ending, with her chihuahua picked up by a crow while at the park – then dropped about 500 metres away. Chihuahua Rescue Australia founder and president, Natalie Brabham, said she had warned chihuahua owners about the risk, especially if they live in a rural area. “There are hawks, eagles – you hear stories in the US frequently about chihuahuas taken by wedge-tailed eagles, bald eagles, even crows.” She said she had trained her own chihuahua, Valentine, to dislike birds: “He will always bark when they come on to the property. I have that fear ... we have magpies in Victoria that swoop.” Brabham said that at four months old Fudge could weigh as little as 700g, and that her chances of survival depended on whether she’d been dropped, and where. A “small puppy police patrol” coordinated by Chihuahua Rescue Australia was in the area looking for her. “Hopefully we can use social media and people-power to look for her ... time is of the essence if she has been dropped and she is injured.” Crows are known to be extremely intelligent and are the only non-primate species known to create tools, such as sticks and hooks which they use to get grubs from logs and branches. A study of wild New Caledonian crows by the University of Auckland two years ago found the birds to be as good at reasoning as a seven-year-old child, with some understanding of causal relationships.",REAL
California gold miners seek a different type of glitter: celebrity,"In the original California gold rush, thousands of prospectors scoured the San Gabriel mountains for nuggets, a scramble marked by rivalry and secrecy: see a gleam, keep shtum. Two centuries later, a handful of descendants use similar equipment to pan in the same crystal cold river, surrounded by the same wilderness, lured by an additional, different type of glitter: celebrity. Instead of concealing pay-dirt spots, these prospectors broadcast them on YouTube, giving locations and encouraging viewers to trek out and join them. In return, if they draw enough online traffic, they gain a slice of fame and modest payments from Google, which owns YouTube, for eyeballs on ads. “Since I started doing the videos, it got kind of addictive,” said Robert Ferguson, 52, whose channel has more than 1,700 subscribers and 384,0000 views. “There’s a little bit of stardom. People recognise me. It’s not much, but Google pays me.” Ferguson, wearing a singlet, muddy shorts and boots, spoke during a break from sifting rocks and gravel by the San Gabriel river. Three other prospectors worked alongside him. All, it turned out, had first encountered each other via YouTube. The video-sharing website has become a noticeboard for an eclectic community of prospectors to share information, show off skill or luck, cultivate online followers, and nurture dreams of fame, with one particular motherlode: starring in a reality TV show. “I’m terrible at video. My wife says I’m the worst in the world,” said Larry Englehart, 67, ankle-deep in burbling water. “Instead of a nugget, I show a guy’s bellybutton. But people must be bored, because they look at them.” The retired industrial painter’s channel has acquired 822 subscribers and 171,000 page views. The biggest online success is Jeff Williams, an exuberant, buckskin-wearing character who boasts 62,000 subscribers and close to 15m views. Few, if any, prospectors expect to get rich. Nuggets seem long gone from this part of the river. A day’s arduous digging and panning for gold dust typically yields about half a gramme (worth $20), though with luck you could get maybe 5 grammes (worth $200), or with no luck, nothing. The possibility of internet stardom, or just recognition, spurs relatively new arrivals such as Ryan Reynolds, 28. He recorded a brief piece to his camera phone – “Hey, the Guardian is here, hopefully they’ll make us sound nice and not like total losers” – before climbing into a waist-deep hole to heave a boulder. Having only just started, Reynolds has only 98 subscribers. But he tasted fame when a stranger approached him at a gold convention. “He said, ‘I know you – you’re Odd Ryan.’ I was blown away.” Reynolds, whose day job is washing dogs at a pet salon, uses the moniker Odd Ryan on his YouTube channel to avoid being confused with the famous Canadian actor. Also in the hole was his partner, Brandon Preciado, 35. A DJ at a Hollywood nightclub and an ultrasound technician, he “caught gold fever” after watching YouTube videos and reality shows such as Yukon Gold. When Ferguson and Englehart turned up to dig nearby, mutual admiration flowed, as is prospector etiquette. “I’ve seen all your work,” Reynolds told Englehart. “Great to meet you.” Englehart batted the words away with self-deprecation but glowed. Ferguson praised Preciado, saying he had seen a video of him nimbly moving heavy rocks. Preciado almost blushed. “All I do is copy Savage, man.” Savage is the nickname of another miner. At first sight, social media seems far removed from the scene at East Fork, a trail in the San Gabriel Mountains national monument, an idyll of wooded canyons an hour’s drive east from Los Angeles. There is no cellphone coverage, and there are no sounds except birds, insects, wind and the occasional whack of metal on rock. The spot is home to mountain lions, eagles, rattlesnakes, bears – including a patriarch named Baxter – and a wild turkey named Gobbles. The prospectors, dressed in ragged jeans and shorts, work much as their predecessors did during the 1840s gold rush: shovel and sieve soil into buckets, transfer it into sluice boxes and let river water run through it, leaving behind, they hope, gold traces. “There’s nothing like the thrill of finding a piece of treasure. And that’s what we are, treasure hunters,” said Nick McKinney, 35, a former oil rig worker who goes by “Wyoming Nick”. The mountains are said to whistle from all the holes and shafts, legacy of gold hunting by Native Americans, Spanish settlers and then the “49ers”, Americans and newly arrived immigrants from Europe, Asia and Latin America who flocked here, and to other parts of California, on wagons, mules and foot. “My folks think I’m nuts. They say there’s no gold left, that the old-timers got it all. But they didn’t. There’s plenty left,” said Preciado, who goes by DJ Foulmouth. There are legends of hidden veins and buried, forgotten fist-sized nuggets, but the reality is pay dirt is so meagre it often does not cover the cost of gas. The yo-yo global gold price – currently $1,245 an ounce, relatively high, taking the long view – seems an abstraction. For prospectors, the exertion and frontier feel of the mountains – notwithstanding hordes of bungee-jumpers who trek through at weekends – is its own reward. “It sounds weird, digging a hole by the river. But I’m a nature person,” said Reynolds, who finds respite from his minimum wage job bathing pampered pets. “Being bit sucks. And dealing with rich people – I can’t stand them.” Ferguson, who is unemployed and cares for a brother with a neurodegenerative disease, echoed the sense of escape. “Being a caregiver, you get depressed if that’s all you do. You need a place to go. This is my place.” For Englehart, hunting gold represented resurrection. Diagnosed with hepatitis C in 2002, he was “sent home to die” but ended up surviving extremely aggressive chemotherapy. After discovering Ferguson’s videos, he started trekking to San Gabriel. “I was a lump of jelly with not one muscle left in my body. Hiking here, panning for gold, you forget all your problems.” Environmentalists say digging holes and making dams make problems for threatened species like the Santa Ana Sucker and other wildlife. And that mining is illegal in a federally designated wilderness. The miners deny causing damage and claim the law is unclear. It’s not: mining is illegal, but authorities tend to turn a blind eye. Lies, robbery and murder marked the original gold rush. Perhaps because the stakes are much lower, its 21st century sequel feels like a support group, with members teaming up and pooling information. “It’s almost like a brotherhood. Everyone helps each other out all the time,” said Reynolds. Englehart agreed. “I don’t think there’s any secrets up here.” The exception is further upriver where hardy prospectors trek deep into remote areas where there is more gold, and more reason to keep quiet. Ferguson, who makes a few dozen dollars per month from YouTube, said advertising a hole he was working on was not necessarily altruistic. “Sometimes I want people to come out there and dig deeper so that when I go back I’ll get more gold.” Reality TV producers have reached out to him but he is still awaiting an offer. His advice to would-be YouTube prospectors: “Be real, don’t lie, be yourself. Try to show snakes, flowers, wildlife.” California, said Ferguson, polishing his pitch, was the obvious location for a mining show. “It’s the golden state.”",REAL
Captain Cook's Endeavour: from the Great Barrier Reef to Rhode Island?,"Captain James Cook observed the transit of Venus from the shores of Tahiti, ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef and claimed Australia for the British crown. He fought the French in the Americas, circumnavigated the world and died trying to kidnap a king of Hawaii. But the ship that saw so many adventures was sold, forgotten and lost. For centuries, the fate of HMS Endeavour has remained a mystery. Now marine archaeologists are almost certain they have found its wreck at the bottom of the sea – off exotic Rhode Island. Researchers with the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (Rimap) will announce on Wednesday that they are nearly sure that they have found the Endeavour, the ship that Cook captained on his voyages to New Zealand and Australia. “We usually don’t make any announcement as we keep working away until we have something significant to say,” Dr Kathy Abbass, principal investigator, said. “We may say, ‘we think we found the Endeavour,’ well, yeah. Now I have to prove it.” Admiralty documents detailing the Endeavour’s dimensions have led Abbass to believe that the ship, built like a sturdy commercial vessel to carry survival and scientific cargo on a long voyage, was sold into private hands in 1775 and renamed Lord Sandwich – the first lord of the admiralty at the time. When the 13 American colonies revolted a year later, it was leased back to the British navy as a troop transport for British and Hessian soldiers, and then used as a prison ship in Newport Harbor, Rhode Island, during the war. Rhode Island was the first state to disavow its loyalty to King George III, exactly two months before the 13 colonies formally issued the Declaration of Independence. By late August 1778, American forces had besieged Newport, and were hoping the French navy could help them oust the British from the harbor town. The British decided to scuttle 13 other ships, Lord Sandwich among them, to stymie the French navy en route. A world away its former captain had crossed the Bering Sea into the Arctic Circle and was hunting walruses for food and oil. He would die only a few months after his most famous ship was wrecked. Abbass’s team, working with Australian researchers, have mapped nine of the 13 sites where the ships were scuttled. Five of those ships were wrecked in an arc, near the modern Naval War College to the north and in the waters by Brenton Cove to the south. The researchers have mapped four. “We think we have a really good chance to close in on the fifth one,” Abbass said, noting a recent analysis of remote sensing data on the harbor. In a statement, Rimap said it “now has an 80 to 100% chance that the Lord Sandwich is still in Newport Harbor, and because the Lord Sandwich was Capt Cook’s Endeavour, that means Rimap has found her, too.” The researchers will next map the remaining portions of the harbor in their search for the wreck itself. The researchers estimate that their research on 83 projects, including other revolutionary-era vessels, second world war wrecks and a reputed slave ship, has a total value of more than $5.5m. The wreck of the Endeavour would probably be their most valuable discovery yet: the first European ship to land in Australia, leading to the founding of a British colony there, and the flagship of one of Britain’s greatest explorers. Although the Endeavour was largely forgotten by its contemporaries, its later fame has led to rumors and speculation about the ship’s fate. Some have suggested the ship survived the war, was refitted and registered as a French vessel, La Liberté, and then sunk into Newport harbor in 1794. Others believed the ship actually made it back to London, and was opened to visitors in 1825, and in the 19th century a New Zealand captain thought he found the wreck in Dusky Sound, only to be proven wrong. In 1991, when the space shuttle Endeavour was rolled out for service by Nasa, the space agency was presented with what they called “a piece of the original ship”, by the University of Rhode Island. Abbass hopes to put the mystery of the original Endeavour’s fate to rest in the next few months, and called for a new facility to conserve, display and store some of the artifacts pulled from the underwater sites. Rimap hopes to build this facility at Butts Hill Fort, the center of where American forces stood during the battle for the colony.",REAL
"FTSE slips back on miners and Sainsbury, but Next and BAE buck trend","Leading shares in the UK are dipping lower again but reasonable eurozone services surveys are providing some support, even helping European markets edge higher. Mining shares are among the biggest losers on the FTSE 100 on continuing concerns about the strength of the global economy and thus demand for commodities, but BAE Systems has climbed 1% to 481.2p after saying it had made a good start to the year. The statement comes ahead of its annual meeting, but analyst Sandy Morris at Jefferies remained cautious: The AGM statement says BAE has “good momentum”, but provides no real substance for that assertion, in our view. The breadth of BAE’s business and programmes does make it robust, even were there no further export for Typhoon, but we believe there is arguably still some uncertainty about the rate of growth BAE can sustain over the next three years. BAE appears to have made a satisfactory start to 2016, but has arguably not been able to generate any excitement. We recognise the backdrop looks more positive. Certainly, the conflict in Yemen appears intractable despite the recent peace negotiations in Kuwait (although the Saudi-led coalition has halted the bombing campaign). On the other hand, the Russian defence budget is under pressure and may now reduce. Looking across BAE’s major US peers, we think it fair to summarise the first quarter of 2016 as having been pretty uneventful in terms of organic growth in sales and the development of order backlogs. We venture BAE is in the same camp. Next has also moved higher, up 212p at £51.90, leading the FTSE 100 risers and recovering from weakness despite downgrading its profit forecasts for the third time in five months. But Sainsbury disappointed with its results, falling 16.1p to 269.6p and helping drag rival Morrisons down 7.7p to 183.2p and Tesco 5.25p lower to 164p. As for the mining shares, BHP Billiton is down 58.9p at 816.4p as copper continued to slide and, perhaps more significantly, Brazilian prosecutors filed a $43.5bn lawsuit against the company and peer Vale for a dam collapse last year which killed 19 people and polluted a major river. Elsewhere Royal Dutch Shell A shares are down 15.5p at 1739.5p after the oil company cut its 2016 spending by 10% following the completion of its takeover of BG, citing continuing low oil prices. Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 38.33 points to 6147.26, not helped by news that the UK construction sector had grown at its slowest rate in nearly three years, albeit bad economic news delays the prospect of any UK rate rise.",REAL
Donald Trump's path to Republican nomination clear as Ted Cruz quits,"Ted Cruz suspended his US presidential campaign on Tuesday after a crushing defeat in Indiana’s primary, leaving the way clear for Donald Trump to become the Republican nominee. The Texas senator was the last remaining competitor to Trump with a clear shot at the nomination. However, after staking his campaign on a win in Indiana, Cruz suffered an overwhelming loss in the Hoosier State. In an inclusive victory speech in which he tried to heal some of the open wounds of the past year and begin the long and very difficult process of unifying the party, Trump had kind words for his vanquished rival. “I don’t know if he likes me or doesn’t like me,” Trump said. “But he is one hell of a competitor. He has an amazing future.” In the Democratic race, Bernie Sanders pulled off a shock victory, beating Hillary Clinton by 52.5% to 47.5%, with 97.9% reporting. “The Clinton campaign thinks this campaign is over,” he said. “They’re wrong.” Cruz leaves the Republican race having won 565 delegates and 11 states, including the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses in January. Despite successfully building a strong base among evangelicals and social conservatives, he was unable to expand his following and to pivot to the unpredictable Trump, who repeatedly bashed him as “Lyin’ Ted”. In an emotional address, Cruz told a room of supporters in Indianapolis: “From the beginning I’ve said I will continue on as long as there is a viable path to victory – tonight I am sorry to say it appears that math has been foreclosed.” As the crowd shouted “no, no,” Cruz told attendees: “Together we left it out on the field. We gave it everything we got. But the voters chose another path, and so with a heavy heart but with boundless optimism for the long-term future of our nation we are suspending our campaign.” Cruz repeatedly referenced his idol Ronald Reagan’s unsuccessful attempt to wrest the Republican nomination from Gerald Ford in 1976, ending by promising: “There is no substitute for the America we will restore as the shining city on the hill for generations to come,” a reference to Reagan’s farewell address. The Republican party elite, which has battled over the prospect of a Trump nomination, began to rally round him. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, declared that Trump was the “presumptive nominee” and called on supporters to unite against Hillary Clinton. Cruz’s exit leaves John Kasich the only remaining candidate in the race against Trump. In a statement, the Ohio governor’s chief strategist, John Weaver, told the Guardian: “The senator ran on strong conservative principles and his views are part of the broad Republican party. Donald Trump’s mad hatter ramblings are outside the conservative reform movement and we will continue onward to deny him the nomination.” Kasich did not compete in Indiana as a result of a pact with Cruz and has so far only won his home state of Ohio. In a memo sent out earlier Tuesday night, Kasich vowed to stay in “unless a candidate reaches 1,237 bound delegates before the convention”. Victory speech Trump celebrated victory at his looming Fifth Avenue tower in New York, marking the seminal moment in which he was transformed from a maverick and implausible candidate into presumptive Republican nominee. He delivered his victory speech from a podium poignantly positioned just in front of the escalator in his midtown Manhattan skyscraper where he had launched his unlikely bid for the White House 10 months ago. Flanked by his wife Melania and children, with his controversial campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and convention manager Paul Manafort close by, he made soothing noises towards the Republican National Committee and its chairman Reince Preibus. “It’s not an easy job dealing with 17 egos,” he said, referring to the initial crowded pack of Republican presidential hopefuls, before adding: “I guess he’s now down to one ego.” Trump effectively takes the nomination with a personal rating among voters stuck in the doldrums, with 67% of Americans thinking of him unfavorably. That makes him the least well-regarded presidential nominee of either main party since at least 1984 – and the hostility shown towards him by leaders of the Republican party is unprecedented. But none of those hard facts appeared to take any shine off Trump’s moment of victory. “We want to bring unity to the Republican party. We have to bring unity,” he said. Trump glossed over his terrible poll ratings among female voters by saying: “Women. I love winning with women.” He similarly shrugged off similar evidence of the major problem he faces with Hispanic voters and African Americans. “We are going to win, we are going to win in November. And we are going to win big,” he said. Recognizing the shift in gear that faces the Trump campaign, he put a marker in the sand. “Now we are going after Hillary Clinton,” Trump said. “She will not be a great president, she will not be a good president, she will be a poor president.” He indicated that he intended to go after Clinton on the issue of trade and the loss of American jobs to foreign countries. “She doesn’t understand trade and her husband signed perhaps in the history of the world the single worst trade deal, Nafta.” He also highlighted Clinton’s comments on the coal industry and the need to restrict it in the fight against climate change. “Hillary Clinton talked about the miners as though they were just numbers, and she said she wanted the mines closed and she would never let them work again. Let me tell you, the mines are going to start to work again.” The Sanders campaign hopes his victory in Indiana will mark one last turning point in a Democratic race characterised by a series of surprise comebacks that have prolonged Clinton’s otherwise relentless path toward the nomination. He is well placed to pull off similar wins in West Virginia on 10 May and Oregon on 17 May, before a final showdown next month in California, whose 546 delegates present the biggest prize of the contest. But even though Sanders has pledged to keep competing until the party convention in Philadelphia this July, he has acknowledged that catching up with Clinton is an “uphill struggle”. Before Indiana, the former secretary of state was nearly 300 pledged delegates ahead of her Vermont rival and within 200 delegates of crossing the finish line including the controversial superdelegates – party figures who are able to vote independently of election results and overwhelmingly back Clinton. Nonetheless, the Sanders team will view the Indiana result as an important vindication of their decision to keep pressuring superdelegates to change their minds. ‘Abyss’ Trump’s victory in Indiana ended the best hope of blocking a presidential nomination Cruz had claimed will plunge America into the political “abyss”. The Texas senator’s decision to drop out had been the subject of debate with the campaign but some Cruz aides urging that he still had a better chance of being the nominee after his loss in Indiana than he did when he declared in March. Then Cruz was considered a conservative gadfly who would have to claw and fight rivals to be the favorite among even his Tea Party base but Cruz fended off rival after rival to win the Iowa caucuses and become the conservative standard-bearer in the field. Despite a day of dire warnings from Cruz, Trump was declared victor by the Associated Press within seconds of polls closing. Cruz, whose campaign had built a formidable grassroots operation, with volunteers knocking on 70,000 doors in Indiana in the three days before the primary and making 100,000 calls on the day before the election, but it was all for naught. As one top aide said of the campaign as a whole: “Sometimes you can make all the right moves and still lose.” With 97.9% reporting, Trump had won 53.3% of the vote in Indiana, with Cruz getting 36.6% and Kasich 7.6%. Trump now has 1,047 pledged delegates as well, of the 1,237 he needs to be the party’s nominee. Trump now looks almost certain to inherit a party he has left bitterly divided through a brand of politics defined by innuendo, race-baiting and outright demagoguery. His latest sally came in a telephone interview with Fox News on Tuesday, in which the Republican frontrunner alleged that Cruz’s father, Rafael, had met with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to the assassination of John F Kennedy and implied that Rafael Cruz was somehow involved. Trump had previously threatened to “spill the beans” about Cruz’s wife and has spread a variety of clearly false stories, starting from his June announcement speech that Mexico was deliberately sending rapists into the US and including the repeated claim that American general John Pershing committed war crimes in the Philippines. The latter story appears to have originated via an internet hoax spread by email. Cruz’s campaign-ending loss in Indiana came after a significant investment of resources by anti-Trump forces in the state. Cruz and anti-Trump Super Pacs spent $6m in the state on television advertising while Trump spent less than a million. Further, in a vain attempt for a boost in the Hoosier State, Cruz unveiled former rival Carly Fiorina as his running mate if he receives the nomination and was able to cajole the state’s sitting governor, Mike Pence, into an endorsement. In contrast, Trump was endorsed in the state by a number of prominent former college basketball coaches, led by legendary Indiana University coach Bobby Knight. With his loss on Tuesday night, Cruz had not won a primary election for over a month since his 5 April win in Wisconsin. Despite Cruz doing well in delegate selection contests in Colorado and Wyoming, Trump won seven consecutive primaries and over 200 delegates over the last two weeks. Earlier, Trump had called for Cruz to drop out of the race in a tweet: “Lyin’ Ted Cruz consistently said that he will, and must, win Indiana. If he doesn’t he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time &amp; money.” Cruz took his advice.",REAL
Chief rabbi: Labour has severe problem with antisemitism,"Britain’s chief rabbi has claimed that Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour has a severe problem with antisemitism and warned that the party must not resort to political posturing and empty promises. In a newspaper article, Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said the crisis engulfing Labour had “lifted the lid” on bigotry, and warned that the party’s inquiry into antisemitism must be more than a “sticking plaster” or it would simply worsen the problem. He also hit back at those who argue that it is legitimate to criticise Zionism, arguing that the right to Jewish self-determination has been at the centre of the faith for more than 3,000 years. “It is astonishing to see figures on the hard left of the British political spectrum presuming to define the relationship between Judaism and Zionism despite themselves being neither Jews nor Zionists,” he writes in the Telegraph. “The likes of Ken Livingstone and [NUS president] Malia Boattia claim that Zionism is separate from Judaism as a faith; that is purely political; that is expansionist, colonialist and imperialist.” The strongly worded intervention comes after Corbyn’s party was plunged into crisis after controversial comments by the MP Naz Shah, and Livingstone, led to the pair being suspended. It later emerged that another 16 members had been similarly punished for comments. Corbyn denied there was a big problem in the party, but set up an inquiry headed up by former Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti into antisemitism and other forms of racism. That comes on top of an investigation by Labour peer Jan Royall into allegations of harassment and intimidation of Jewish students at Oxford’s student Labour club. Reports suggest that some of Corbyn’s closest allies are frustrated that the row might shut down what they consider to be legitimate criticism of the state of Israel. Mirvis said he was disheartened to hear allies of Corbyn describe the attacks on antisemitism as a “smear” or “mood music” by political opponents of the Labour leader. “The worst of mistakes, in trying to address this problem, would be to treat it as a political attack which requires a political solution,” he wrote. “If this inquiry turns out to be no more than a sticking plaster, designed to placate and diffuse until after the elections this week, the problem will surely get worse and not better. Jeremy Corbyn has stated that his party ‘will not tolerate antisemitism in any form,’ and I very much hope that this inquiry will deliver on that pledge and be followed by decisive action.” He said all political parties had a responsibility to stamp out such racism, but warned that “political posturing or empty promises” would not be enough. “The last 10 days have lifted the lid on a challenging issue, but if anything, I feel optimistic about the way that this problem has been received,” added Mirvis, saying the world had to tackle bigotry.",REAL

Wonga losses more than double,"The controversial lender Wonga saw losses more than double in 2015 as tougher regulation of the payday loan sector led to a sharp fall in the number of loans taken out by UK consumers. The UK’s biggest payday loan firm reported a pre-tax loss of £80.2m for the year – up from £38.1m the year before. After tax, the company lost £76.5m, versus £43.6m in 2014. Although the firm has interests in other countries, its UK short-term lending arm is at the heart of its business, and in 2013 customers in the UK accounted for 3.8m of the 4m loans it granted. The drop in revenues, to £77.3m from £217.2m in 2014, was driven by a fall in lending following the introduction of stricter criteria at the end of that year and the new price cap for payday lenders at the start of 2015. Across the business the number of loans taken fell to 2.1m. The losses contrast dramatically with the huge profits made by the firm before the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) took over regulation of the sector two years ago. It limited the number of times loans could be extended and how many times lenders could attempt to recover repayments from borrowers’ bank accounts. Months after the FCA intervened, Wonga was embroiled in scandal for sending out fake legal letters to struggling borrowers and cleared the overdue debts or charges for 375,000 people at a cost of £220m. The firm said the process of refunding the affected customers was “broadly complete”, but £10m remained aside for those it had not yet managed to contact. In January 2015 interest and fees on all high-cost short-term credit loans were capped at a daily rate of 0.8% of the amount borrowed. Meanwhile, if borrowers do not repay their loans on time, default charges must not exceed £15, while the total cost including fees and interest is capped at 100% of the original sum. Wonga’s results show that revenues from interest fell by more than two thirds, from £157m to £46m. Despite the downward trend in revenues, the group chief executive, Andy Haste, said he expected 2016 “to mark a turning point in our financial performance”, and for the firm to return to profit next year. Since moving from the insurer RSA to take the helm, Haste has attempted to reposition Wonga as a firm for middle-class customers. He ditched the controversial Wonga puppets and relaunched the brand with new TV adverts in May 2015. Haste said: “We have made real progress towards creating a sustainable business with an accepted place in financial services. “These results are in line with the plans we put together when joining Wonga. They reflect a full year’s impact of the stricter lending criteria we implemented in late 2014, the price cap introduced by the UK regulator in early 2015, and the necessary investment we have made to transform the business. We expect 2016 to mark a turning point in our financial performance.” Haste said the new management had overhauled its approach to credit risk. Defaults at the firm fell from 7.4% to 4.4% at group level and from 6.6% to 2.8% in the UK. “We’re pleased with the progress we have made and were delighted to be granted authorisation by the Financial Conduct Authority earlier this year. “Moving into 2016, our plans included achieving UK authorisation, raising debt funding and starting to roll out new products. Having achieved these, and with further funding planned for later this year, we’re now in a position to move back into growth in 2016 and expect to return to profit in 2017.” Haste and his team said they had overhauled computer systems at the lender, which were “not fit for purpose”, and completed a redundancy programme that saw 200 people leave the business. They said the name Wonga was set to remain despite its tarnished reputation. “We’ve always said from the start that we didn’t want to simply change the name, we wanted to show that change could be implemented rather than trying to do a brandwash and run away from the past,” said Haste. “We have considered whether Wonga one day will become a product name for the kind of loans we’re doing at the moment and we have other names for other things, but we are a bit of a way off from that.”",REAL
"Indonesia is preparing to execute prisoners, police official confirms","Indonesia is preparing to execute several prisoners, a police official has said, confirming reports that a year-long pause in the death penalty could be nearing an end. Authorities have not said how many prisoners will face the firing squad or if foreigners will be among them. Two Britons, Lindsay Sandiford and Gareth Cashmore, are on death row in the south-east Asian nation, which has a notoriously hardline attitude towards drug offences. “We have had a warning since last month to prepare the place,” said the Central Java provincial police spokesman Aloysius Lilik Darmanto. “We carried out some rehabilitation of the location, like painting and repairs, because there will probably be more people who will be executed,” he said, adding that the firing squad had been training and receiving counselling. He declined to say how many prisoners would be executed, or when, or if there would be foreigners among them. After 14 prisoners were executed in January and April 2015, drawing widespread international condemnation, scheduled executions were postponed, with officials saying the government preferred to focus on reviving the economy. But President Joko Widodo’s administration has pledged to resume executions by firing squad at an island prison on Nusa Kambangan, claiming they are a necessary response to the country’s “drug emergency”. The most recent round of executions, in which eight men, including seven foreigners, were shot dead in April last year, sparked condemnation from Australia and Brazil, which had pleaded for their nationals to be spared. Two Australian men, the Bali Nine pair Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were executed, prompting the temporary withdrawal from Jakarta of Canberra’s ambassador. Authorities have not given a breakdown of the numbers of people sentenced to death, but according to Amnesty International, there were at least 165 people on death row at the end of 2015, and more than 40% of those were sentenced for drug-related crimes. Many of them are foreigners, and citizens of France, Britain and the Philippines are known to be among them. Sandiford, from the UK, was sentenced to death after being convicted in 2013 of trying to smuggle almost 4kg of cocaine into Bali. Cashmore was sentenced to life imprisonment – later raised to death by firing squad – after he was caught with 6.5kg of crystal meth in his luggage at Jakarta airport in 2011. A Philippine maid, Mary Jane Veloso, got a last-minute reprieve in April last year in response to a request from Manila after a woman whom Veloso had accused of planting drugs in her luggage gave herself up to police in the Philippines. Her lawyer said he hoped she would not be in the next batch of prisoners to be executed. “The execution of Mary Jane should be delayed because we are waiting for the legal process in the Philippines,” said the lawyer, Agus Salim. A lawyer for Serge Atlaoui, a French national, said authorities had not contacted the French embassy on whether his client would be executed in the next batch. Atlaoui, who denies being the “chemist” for an ecstasy factory outside Jakarta, exhausted all legal appeals in mid-2015. The government typically informs the embassies of foreign convicts only days before their executions. Indonesia imposed a moratorium on executions for five years before resuming them in 2013. It has executed 14 people, most of them foreigners, under Widodo. Indonesia’s representative at a UN narcotics conference was jeered last month when he defended the use of capital punishment for drug offences, a penalty that is contrary to international law.

Philippines elections 2016: what you need to know – the Guardian briefing,"What’s happening? The Philippines is holding elections for almost all branches of government. The most powerful posts of president and vice-president will be voted for, with the winners serving one six-year term. Also up for grabs are 12 seats, or half of the senate; all governor posts, all mayors, and all city and municipal councils. When is voting day? Monday 9 May. Walls and roadsides across the country of 101 million people have been covered in campaign posters. When will we know the results? During the 2010 presidential election on 10 May, unofficial tallies showed Benigno Aquino III was the leading candidate in the days following voting. But it was not until nearly a month later, on 9 June, that congress declared him as the president-elect. How did he do in power? Aquino has been credited for bringing political stability and economic prosperity as foreign investment rises. He has also drawn up the framework of a peace deal in the south and made inroads into fighting graft. But the southern province of Mindanao still needs rebuilding, corruption is rampant in politics, and Islamist militants remain able to operate. Who will win this time? The current front-runner is Rodrigo Duterte, also known as “the Punisher”. In a profanity-laced campaign, he has promised to kill criminals in the streets, joked about raping a missionary and threatened to sever ties with Australia and the United States. What is his background? The 71-year-old motorbike fanatic was mayor of the southern city of Davao for two decades, where he drastically reduced crime. However, human rights groups accuse him of allowing vigilante death squads to carry out hundreds of extrajudicial killings. The political establishment is in shock but Duterte is way ahead in many polls, having promised to end drug crime in three to six months and pardon security forces who kill criminals. Speaking last month, the man known as Duterte Harry said his presidency “will be a bloody one”. Duterte is popular because many see him as an outsider who can end years of the same types of politicians, and also use quick fixes to deal with the south-east Asian nation’s problems. Many have compared his demagogic rise to that of Donald Trump, although Duterte says Trump is a bigot. Duterte is also openly supportive of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights, a sensitive topic in a mainly Catholic country. Joshua Kurlantzick, a fellow for south-east Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, describes him as “the ultimate wildcard”. Who are the other candidates? It’s a five-way race and Senator Grace Poe comes second in the opinion surveys. An economic liberal who would have the country join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, 47-year-old Poe also plans to liberalise foreign investment laws. She is the daughter of a famous Filipino action hero, Fernando Poe Jr, who failed to enter high office, and was the favourite for months before Duterte took the lead in April. Poe has a fairly clean image, and has not been dragged into the corruption scandals that are widespread in Philippine politics. Despite being a former US citizen – she had to drop citizenship to run – Poe has distanced herself from Washington, but that might be seen as a political move after her foes painted her as a US stooge. Behind Poe is current vice-president Jejomar Binay. The 73-year-old has not received Aquino’s blessing and Binay has promised to work more closely with China, a shift away from his boss. Binay comes from a political family that has run Manila’s financial district, Makati, for decades. He has, however, focused on policies for the poor, including free medical care and education. Aquino’s own choice for his successor, Mar Roxas, is seen as bringing a continuation of the outgoing premier’s policies, especially bolstering Manila’s links with Washington and other regional powers such as Japan against China’s territorial assertiveness in the South China Sea (called the West Philippine Sea in the Philippines). Last in the polls is Miriam Defensor Santiago,who has run three times for the presidency. She says she wants to end her career in politics as the president “unless I get struck by another bout of cancer, but it doesn’t happen that often” – referring to her stage four lung cancer. Any others to watch? The Philippines was the first democracy in south-east Asia but there are good odds on the late dictator’s son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, taking the vice-presidency. The voting system allows for this as the president and vice-president are voted for separately, so they are unlikely to come from the same party. Known as “Bongbong”, Marcos’ run at the highest elective post any family member has tried for since his father died, and his anti-establishment platform, have been incredibly successful as many Filipinos are disillusioned with the slow pace of change. The imposition of martial law, torture and billions of dollars of plundered wealth during his father’s two decades in power has so far not greatly tainted his campaign. Also on the ballot is boxing legend Manny Pacquiao, who is running for the senate in Binay’s team. He’s a hero in the country – street kid to superstar to political contender – and polls suggest he is almost guaranteed to win a seat. Having already served two terms as a congressmen, the evangelical Christian damaged his reputation abroad when he said gay people were “worse than animals”. Nike cancelled his sponsorship immediately. In the Philippines, his popularity briefly dropped but has since recovered.",REAL
EU executive to propose asylum reforms and approve Turkey visa deal,"European countries that refuse to give shelter to refugees could be forced to pay into the coffers of states that do, under plans to be unveiled by the European commission on Wednesday. The idea is part of a long-awaited proposal to reform the EU’s asylum rules, which were stretched to breaking point by the arrival of more than one million refugees and migrants last year. A copy of the draft regulation confirms that the commission has watered down earlier ambitions to centralise European asylum policy by allocating refugees around the bloc according to a quota system determined by a country’s wealth and size. The commission will also signal its approval for the lifting of visa restrictions on 79 million Turks. Granting Turks visa-free access to the EU’s Schengen zone was a crucial part of the deal the EU struck with Ankara to reduce migrant flows The UK can choose whether or not to take part in the new EU asylum system. EU countries would still be responsible for housing refugees who arrive on their territory, preserving a key principle of existing asylum rules known as the Dublin regulation. Unlike under Dublin, refugees could be dispersed around the EU via a “corrective fairness mechanism” in the event that countries that are the first arrival point are unable to cope. Commission officials are anxious to ease the pressure on frontline states, notably Greece and Italy, which have been struggling to handle the large numbers of refugees and migrants arriving on their shores. Countries that refuse to take in refugees would be required to pay EU states that are doing more. Although the sum has not yet been finalised, the draft law suggests “a solidarity contribution” of €250,000 (£198,000) per asylum applicant. The idea chimes with the thinking of Italy’s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, who has long argued that eastern and central European countries should be denied EU funds for refusing to help with the EU migration crisis. Hungary and Slovakia refused to take part in a one-off scheme to redistribute 160,000 refugees from Greece and Italy to other EU countries, but there was nothing in existing EU law to levy any financial penalty on them. The corrective fairness mechanism would be modelled on that redistribution scheme, which has seen painfully slow progress. Out of the 160,000 refugees, only 937 were resettled in first six months of its operation. Although the European court of justice routinely issues fines to countries that flout EU law, introducing fines for not taking refugees is likely to be controversial. Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the Liberal group in the European parliament, said reform of “the outdated Dublin regulation” was essential. “Tough times require bold decisions, which is why I call on EU governments to give these proposals a fair hearing,” he said. The plans represent something of a victory for David Cameron, who had strenuously campaigned to preserve the principle that countries that are the first port of arrival for asylum seekers should be responsible them. A government source said the proposals showed that “the best way to get a good deal for the UK in Europe is to stay at the table and stand up for British interests”, adding: “It shows that Britain can work with the European commission to come up with pragmatic solutions. “These new plans give Britain the best of both worlds by retaining the right to remove asylum seekers to EU countries – but without opting in to the Schengen area’s burden-sharing scheme. We now know that taking a leap into the dark by voting to leave the EU would leave the UK powerless to return thousands of asylum seekers to other European countries.” Successive British governments have chosen to opt into EU asylum policy so they can send back asylum seekers to other countries. But Downing Street is likely to be concerned that a debate on the EU’s asylum rules could boost the Brexit campaign. While European leaders have been scrambling to come up with a plan to stop migrants getting on boats bound for Greece, a parallel debate has been raging about reforming the EU’s defunct asylum rules. In another boost for the British government, the commission states that any mandatory redistribution of refugees will take into account government efforts to resettle refugees from third countries. The UK has promised to resettle 20,000 Syrians from Turkey over five years, but has refused to take refugees currently in Greece, arguing that this would encourage more people to make perilous journeys across the sea. This stance has now gained tacit approval from the commission.",REAL
Bernie Sanders pulls off shock victory over Hillary Clinton in Indiana,"Bernie Sanders threw a last-minute hurdle in front of Hillary Clinton’s march toward the Democratic party nomination on Tuesday by clinching a surprise victory in the Indiana primary. Despite trailing by an average of seven points in opinion polls and losing a string of bigger, more diverse states on the east coast, Sanders once again proved his appeal to disaffected midwest voters by pulling off his 18th victory of 2016, according to Associated Press projections. Sanders seemed on track to win a narrow majority of the 83 delegates on offer. With 93% reporting, Sanders had 52.7% of the vote to Clinton’s 47.3%. Sanders said: “The Clinton campaign thinks this campaign is over. They’re wrong. Maybe it’s over for the insiders and the party establishment, but the voters in Indiana had a different idea.” His success in Indiana was overshadowed by Ted Cruz’s decision to drop out of the Republican race, leaving the path to victory clear for Donald Trump. The Sanders campaign hopes that Indiana will mark one last turning point in a Democratic race characterised by a series of surprise comebacks that have prolonged Clinton’s otherwise relentless path toward the nomination. He is well placed to pull off similar wins in West Virginia on 10 May and Oregon on 17 May, before a final showdown next month in California, whose 546 delegates present the biggest prize of the contest. But even though Sanders has pledged to keep competing until the party convention in Philadelphia this July, he has acknowledged that catching up with Clinton is an “uphill struggle”. “We are in this campaign to win and we’re going to fight until the last vote is cast. There is nothing I would like more than to take on and defeat Donald Trump, someone who must never become president of this country,” he said on Tuesday night, calling for a debate with Clinton in California. Before Indiana, the former secretary of state was nearly 300 pledged delegates ahead of her Vermont rival and within 200 delegates of crossing the finish line, with help from the controversial superdelegates – party figures who are able to vote independently of election results and overwhelmingly back Clinton. Nonetheless, the Sanders team will view the Indiana result as an important vindication of their decision to keep pressuring superdelegates to change their minds. “We always thought Indiana was a state that would absolutely be willing to listen to this message,” Pete D’Alessandro, a top Sanders operative who is overseeing his efforts in Indiana, told the Guardian in advance of the result. “Because Nafta and these terrible trade agreements have just devastated the state over the past generation.” Crediting a long-active volunteer effort, he expressed confidence that Sanders would do well. After trailing behind Clinton when votes started to be announced in Indiana, Sanders was speaking to a rally in neighbouring Kentucky at the moment he first took the lead. “A lot has happened over the course of the last year,” he told cheering supporters at the rally in Louisville. “When we started this campaign, we were 60 points behind Secretary Clinton; some of the [national] polls now even have us ahead.” Whatever happens at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia in July, Sanders is increasingly focusing on how far he has come rather than how far he still has to go and the unlikely prospect he catches up in the nomination race. “In primary after primary, caucus after caucus, we end up winning the votes of people 45 years or younger,” said Sanders in Kentucky, which votes on 17 May. “That is important because it tells me that the ideas we are fighting for are the ideas that are the future of America and the future of the Democratic party.” Sanders also does well in states like Indiana that have open primaries, something he says shows his ability to win over independent voters who might be more tempted to vote for Trump. “The issue of wealth and income equality is the great moral issue of our time, the great economic issue of our time and the great political issue of our time and together we will address that issue,” he added. Nonetheless, Clinton advisers have been downplaying expectations for some of the remaining states in recent days and do not believe the small number of net delegates that Sanders can pick up will make any difference at all to the eventual result. On Tuesday night she ignored her Democratic opponent in favour of an attack on the man she called “the presumptive Republican nominee”. “Chip in now if you agree we can’t let him become president,” she urged her supporters.",REAL
"China's military appeals to younger generation with 'kill, kill, kill' video","China’s military is appealing to the younger generation with a slick new recruitment video featuring aircraft carriers, rocket launchers, tanks and fighter jets, all set to a rousing rap-rock soundtrack. With lyrics such as “just waiting for the order to kill, kill, kill”, the video appears aimed at millennials brought up on first-person shooter video games such as Call of Duty. While no potential opponents are identified in the clip, it cautions that “war can break out at any time” and asks “are you ready?” At one point in the three-minute film, a man brandishing an AK-47 is shot in the head. The video, available on Wednesday via a link on the defence ministry’s official website, appears as the 2.3 million-member People’s Liberation Army is downsizing in an effort to boost its war-fighting capabilities. Chief among those steps is a cut of 300,000 personnel, while the navy, missile corps and air force are receiving more attention and funding. The video presents an image of the PLA as a hi-tech and high-powered force. While catering to traditional patriotic sentiments, it heavily emphasises the advances made by the world’s largest standing military as it takes on missions further afield. China’s sole aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, is featured prominently, as are latest generation tanks, warplanes, attack helicopters and ballistic missiles that were showcased in a massive military parade through the heart of Beijing in September. “Ambassadors of peace, we are the guardians of China. Ambassadors of power, we are the tiger’s teeth,” said some of the lyrics. It ends with a shot of a soldier passionately planting a Chinese flag into a patch of presumably foreign soil. Traditionally focused on land-based threats and China’s threat to invade Taiwan, the PLA has taken on increasingly complex tasks, including long-range aerial patrols in the East China Sea, an anti-piracy mission in the Gulf of Aden and defending Beijing’s maritime claims in the South China Sea.

"UK's claims over Saudi bombing in Yemen 'deeply disappointing', say MPs","The British government’s claim that Saudi Arabia’s bombing campaign in Yemen has not breached international humanitarian law is “deeply disappointing” and contributes to an “anything goes” attitude from the opposing sides in the conflict, the international development select committee has said. The finding comes as a rebuke to the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, who made the assessment despite a UN-sponsored report and many charities presenting evidence to the contrary. The Conservative-dominated committee said the Saudi inquiry into the Yemen campaign, supported by the Foreign Office, was inadequate and called for an independent inquiry. “It is deeply disappointing that the UK government does not accept that breaches of international humanitarian law have taken place in Yemen,” the committee said in a report. “The failure to hold parties to the conflict to account for their actions appears to have contributed to an ‘anything goes’ attitude by both sides to this conflict.” Saudi Arabia entered the Yemeni civil war in March 2015 at the head of a coalition supporting the government against Shia Houthi rebels and forces loyal to the deposed president Ali Abdullah Saleh. About 6,400 people, half of them civilians, were killed in the first year of the Saudi intervention, according to World Health Organization figures, and 2.5 million were displaced. The MPs’ report, published on Wednesday, found that “there was clear evidence [that] international humanitarian law is being breached, making the relief effort difficult and dangerous. Schools, health and vital water and nutrition supplies are at risk, while the civilian population bears the brunt of the fighting. Yemen faces one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world, with 82% of the population in need of assistance”. But in a sign of the sensitivity of UK-Saudi relations, Conservative MPs on the committee blocked a call for Britain’s highly profitable arms sales to Saudi Arabia to be suspended pending clear evidence that the air campaign in Yemen was targeting civilians. The six Conservatives on the 11-member committee voted for UK weapons sales to be referred to a separate committee specialising in arms exports. In correspondence with the committee, Hammond set out a series of reasons why the government believes that there is no case for revoking licences issued to arms exporters. He said the Saudi-led coalition was not targeting civilians; Saudi Arabia’s processes and procedures were in place to ensure respect for the principles of international humanitarian law; and the kingdom was investigating incidents of concern, including those involving civilian casualties. “Saudi Arabia has throughout engaged in constructive dialogue with the UK about both its processes and incidents of concern,” Hammond told the committee. “Saudi Arabia has been and remains genuinely committed to [international humanitarian law] compliance”. David Mepham, the UK director of Human Rights Watch, said in response that multiple attacks on markets, hospitals, schools and private homes had been documented in violation of the laws of war. “Hammond misleadingly claims the Saudis have procedures in place to ensure adherence to the laws of war and investigate incidents of concern,” he said. “But the reality is one of ongoing, large-scale violations by the Saudis in Yemen that have continued for over a year and a refusal by the Saudis either to acknowledge these violations or properly investigate them.” A Saudi internal inquiry into the Yemen campaign, set up in January in response to international criticism, has not yet published any findings. The Foreign Office minister, Tobias Ellwood, said last week that he had contacted the Saudi ambassador to the UK to complain that the inquiry was taking an excessively long time. The MPs’ report said it remained “unconvinced that Saudi Arabia is best placed to conduct investigations into reports of [international humanitarian law] abuses by the Saudi-led coalition. It is a longstanding principle of the rule of law that inquiries should be independent of those being investigated”. In separate evidence last week, the minister for defence procurement, Philip Dunne, revealed for the first time that British officials stationed in Riyadh had access to reports compiled by the Saudi air force into its air raids. He said the UK government advises the Saudi air force on general air campaign tactics, but not individual targets. Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, called on the British government to reveal the findings of UK officials in Riyadh. “A Conservative-controlled select committee has found, unlike the foreign secretary, that there are breaches of international humanitarian law by the Saudis using UK weapons,” he said. “Due to the absence of an independent inquiry, and the failure of the Saudi government, acknowledged by the Foreign Office, to publish its findings of its inquiry, it is time [for] the foreign secretary to publish details of what UK government officials have found about the Saudi bombing campaign. “We now need to know what UK officials based in Riyadh are reporting back to their political masters back in London. Otherwise the only conclusion is that Britain is colluding in breaches of humanitarian law and Hammond is covering this up.”",REAL
"'Emergency brake' unlikely to lead to big cut in migration, say experts","David Cameron’s “emergency brake” denying access to in-work benefits for new European Union migrants is unlikely to lead to a large reduction in migration to the UK, according to expert analysis. Oxford University’s Migration Observatory says the key element in Cameron’s renegotiation package with the EU, under which newly arrived migrants will be denied access to in-work benefits for their first four years, is likely to affect only a small number of families. But the Oxford research also casts doubt on claims that the introduction of the “national living wage” will encourage EU migration mark. The migration experts say the incentive effect of the national living wage for EU citizens over the age of 25 is not clear cut, as it could reduce the availability of low-wage employment. “This would make it harder for EU nationals to find jobs,” the Migration Observatory says. Its report says most EU migrants now claiming in-work benefits such as tax credits did not arrive within the past four years and so would not have been affected by the new “emergency brake” restrictions had they been in place. The researchers say the data shows that roughly 10-20% of recently arrived EU adults were in receipt of tax credits in early 2014. They do not flatly contradict Cameron’s claim last November that 40% of recently arrived European Economic Area migrants were supported by benefits, but they do say the figure is higher than other available estimates, for various reasons including that it counts children as benefits recipients. They found that in 2015 19% of recently arrived EEA migrants reported receiving a state benefit in their own right, falling to 13% if child benefit is excluded. “More than half of EEA-born adults who reported receiving tax credits in 2015 were working full-time, and around 90% had dependent children (despite less than half of EEA-born adults overall having children),” say the Oxford migration experts. This leads them to conclude that the impact of the emergency brake will be “concentrated on a small share of families with children – particularly minimum-wage workers with children and those in families without two-full time earners.” They add that if the national living wage increases the incomes of these families, that would reduce their in-work benefits entitlement even without restrictions on welfare eligibility. Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory, said: “Looking at reliance on welfare benefits overall, migrants from EU countries are actually not very different to people born in the UK. EU migrants are more likely to be working, and so use in-work benefits more than out-of-work ones, but the differences are not dramatic. “A large majority of recent EU migrants are not claiming benefits of any kind. That means that most migrants to the UK would not be affected by proposed changes to the welfare system. That said, some families with children would stand to lose several thousands in tax-credit income, and would still be considerably worse off even if higher minimum wages increase their incomes over the next few years.”",REAL
Scottish Lib Dems try to shake off Clegg's legacy and challenge SNP,"Willie Rennie is on home turf, putting his fate as Scottish Liberal Democrat leader in the hands of people with whom he grew up and went to school. An hour knocking on doors in Cupar in Fife hints at an election upset – a rare victory against the Scottish National party. As he walks and occasionally jogs from bungalow to bungalow, Rennie picks up votes and promises. “That’s number 62, a definite Lib Dem,” he tells a colleague marking down each response. “Another Lib Dem,” he adds, just a few doors down. Here at least, the tally is looking good. Across Scotland, the polls say Rennie’s party is facing more humiliation, trailing behind the Scottish Greens and set for fifth place in Thursday’s Scottish parliamentary elections. But on this estate, more than half say they are voting Lib Dem. Voters, mostly middle-aged or older, are anxious about Nicola Sturgeon’s quest for a second independence vote: “Where would we be if she got a second referendum,” Rennie is asked by one. Another is furious at the Scottish National party “banging their drums on the high street”. However, Rennie’s strongest hand in Cupar, a faded but once prosperous county town west of St Andrews, is local loyalty rather than Scotland’s constitutional future. Born in nearby Strathmiglo and attending school in Cupar, his parents ran several grocers in the area. He meets voters who remember his grandparents, and people who work with old schoolfriends. Rennie is drawing too on the legacy left by Sir Menzies Campbell, the patrician former leader of the UK party, who held the Westminster seat of North East Fife for 28 years before retiring at last year’s general election. Like the vast majority of Scotland’s 59 Commons constituencies, it fell to the SNP. Rennie hopes Campbell’s reputation will be enough to help tip the contest for the area’s near identical Scottish parliament seat his way, and also be strong enough to overcome the remaining ill-feeling over Nick Clegg’s electorally toxic Westminster coalition with the Conservatives in 2010. The Scottish Lib Dems were immediate casualties of Clegg’s alliance, losing 11 of their 16 Holyrood seats the following year – including North East Fife. With his party campaigning for an extra penny on Scottish income tax rates and increased public spending, Rennie says people who voted SNP last year are switching back to the Lib Dems. “The hostility has gone,” he says. “And now there’s the local angle: they want someone who knows the area.” He remembers being in Tayport in the far north-east of the seat last week. “Over the course of an hour, I had five people saying: ‘We were SNP last time, and we’re now going to vote for you.’” The decision during last year’s election campaign by the Lib Dem Alistair Carmichael, then Scotland secretary, to authorise the leak of a government memo that recorded untrue allegations about Sturgeon’s support for Tory leader David Cameron is another self-inflicted wound. That scandal, which lead to Carmichael narrowly surviving an election court challenge, dogs the party’s campaigns to hold on to its two Holyrood constituencies in Orkney and Shetland, the islands that constitute Carmichael’s Westminster seat. Voters in Cupar remember Sir Menzies Campbell with admiration but the coalition with anger. David Pitts, a medical education consultant who was brought up voting Labour, switched to the Lib Dems for tactical reasons. “You could trust [Campbell] to do what he promised to do,” Pitts says. “I think the Lib Dems have had a damned bad press, but Nick Clegg should’ve been horsewhipped when he made that deal [with the Tories] and sold the party down the river.” Sheila Walker, who works in St Andrew’s, cites Campbell too. “He got it right on local politics; he wasn’t one of those absentee politicians.” It is far from certain that will be enough for Rennie: the SNP’s dominance of the polls and Sturgeon’s remarkable popularity suggests the seat’s MSP, Roderick Campbell, will retain it for the SNP on Thursday. The question facing Rennie is whether the Lib Dems can save its five remaining Holyrood seats. Rennie is tense. It is now accepted the SNP will win very comfortably at national level on Thursday and may increase its majority. That leaves the other four parties at Holyrood in two separate battles: a race for second between Labour and the Tories, and the fight for fourth between the Greens and Lib Dems. For the first time, the Lib Dems now have, in the Scottish Greens, genuine rivals in Scotland’s partly proportional voting system. Their fate rests on how the votes are shared out in the complex calculations under the D’Hondt system for deciding the regional list vote. It allocates seven seats in each region by ensuring the full number of constituency and list seats a party gets is as close as possible to the party’s share of the list vote. That calculation is so finely balanced that only a few hundred regional votes either way can win or lose a regional seat. Despite the national polling, which gives the Lib Dems an average vote of 6% on the constituency and 5.3% on the regional vote, the party’s strategists insist it will win more than five seats by taking a handful of regional seats around the country. They are confident of holding Shetland and Orkney, and talk up their prospects of winning Edinburgh Western, a seat where the SNP is damaged by its own controversy over the suspension last year of its MP Michelle Thomson pending a police investigation into alleged financial impropriety. They talk too of improbable upsets in Aberdeenshire West or Aberdeenshire East. These are archetypal Lib Dem tactics. Unable to muster the money and visibility at national level of their larger opponents, the party is practised at fighting each seat as if it were a byelection. And Rennie has pulled off upsets in Fife before. In 2006, Rennie won the then Labour heartland seat of Dunfermline and West Fife in a surprise byelection victory. A former regional organiser for the party in south-west England where he helped engineer its surge to regional dominance in 1997 until its obliteration by the Tories last year, Rennie lost the West Fife seat at the 2010 general election but translated his profile there into a regional list seat at Holyrood the following year. That gave him the platform to become a well-known face in Fife. Canvassing in Dunfermline last week, part of his former Westminster constituency, he was able to trade on that familiarity. He knows that will help him retain his regional list seat, if he fails to win North East Fife.",REAL
China to release last prisoner jailed over Tiananmen Square protests,"The last prisoner being held in China in connection with the 1989 Tiananmen protests is set to be released later this year after nearly three decades behind bars. Miao Deshun, who was 25 at the time of the mass pro-democracy demonstrations, was one of about 1,600 Chinese people jailed following a brutal military crackdown on 4 June 1989 in which hundreds of lives are believed to have been lost. In August that year Miao, a worker from Hebei province, was convicted of arson for allegedly hurling a basket on to a burning tank along with four colleagues. He received a death sentence with a two-year reprieve that was commuted to a life sentence in 1991. The protester’s sentence was reduced on three subsequent occasions – most recently in March this year – meaning he is now due for release on 15 October, the Dui Hua Foundation, a US-based human rights group, announced this week. “We welcome this news, and express the hope that he will receive the care he needs to resume a normal life after spending more than half of it behind bars,” John Kamm, Dui Hua’s executive director, said in a statement. Life outside prison is unlikely to be easy for Miao, who is reported to have multiple health problems. Zhang Yansheng, a fellow Tiananmen convict who was released on parole in 2003, told the US-funded Radio Free Asia he had spent time in prison with Miao and suspected he would struggle to understand “today’s China”. “He has some severe mental health issues, and I think it could take him a long time to get accustomed to life on the outside. I have a pretty hard time myself right now, but it’ll be even worse for him,” Zhang said. Dui Hua said Miao, who is now 51, has had no contact with the outside world for many years, having requested that relatives stop visiting him more than a decade ago. “People who served sentences with him in the 1990s remember him as a very thin man who refused to admit wrongdoing and participate in prison labour,” the group said in a statement. “He is said to have spent time in solitary confinement.” Following a nationwide roundup, China punished hundreds of people for involvement in what the Communist party claimed had been a counter-revolutionary “riot”. But the families of those gunned down by government troops have yet to receive justice or compensation, and even today public remembrance of the massacre is outlawed despite calls for an inquiry. This month marks the 50th anniversary of Chairman Mao’s Cultural Revolution, which began in May 1966 and inflicted a decade of chaos and bloodshed on China, claiming more than one million lives. But Andrew Walder, a China expert from Stanford University, said the Tiananmen protests represented an even more uncomfortable subject for the Communist party’s leaders. “Much more sensitive is what happened in 1989 because that hits much closer to home. That was the one time that the regime was actually shaken to its foundations – even though that was a much smaller upheaval, a much shorter upheaval, a much more contained upheaval than [the Cultural Revolution].”",REAL
Indiana primary: 10 things we learned on an eventful night,"We’re going to wrap up our live coverage of the Indiana primaries shortly. Here’s what happened: Donald Trump emerged as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee with a resounding victory in Indiana, as Ted Cruz suspended his presidential campaign. Bernie Sanders scored an upset victory over Hillary Clinton, though the two split the delegate pile. Sanders vowed the nominating race was not over. Cruz did not mention Trump as he mothballed his campaign but called for the Republican party to look to the far horizon (his 2020 bid?). “I’m sorry to say, it appears that path [to victory] has been foreclosed,” Cruz said. “We gave it everything we’ve got.” Trump praised Cruz as “one hell of a competitor” and “a tough, smart guy”. It was a change in tone from the morning, when he had suggested Cruz’s father had had a hand in the JFK assassination and Cruz had brought up Trump’s “battles with venereal disease”. Republican party chair Reince Priebus called Trump the “presumptive nominee”. Trump said: “We want to bring unity to the Republican party.” Many Republicans resisted that call, vowing on social media to support Clinton or, in any case, not to support Trump. Clinton invited supporters to “chip in now if you agree we can’t let [Trump] become president”. John Kasich’s campaign said he was staying in: “Tonight’s results are not going to alter Governor Kasich’s campaign plans.” Cruz did not depart the national stage gracefully, exactly, elbowing his wife in the face on the way: And some covers of tomorrow’s papers have already popped up:",REAL
China's Xi Jinping denies House of Cards power struggle but attacks 'conspirators',"Xi Jinping has rejected claims that a “House of Cards power struggle” is raging at the pinnacle of Chinese politics, but claimed “conspirators” were attempting to undermine the Communist party from within. In a speech published in Beijing’s official newspaper this week, the Chinese president warned that the presence of “cabals and cliques” inside the party risked “compromising the political security of the party and the country”. “There are careerists and conspirators existing in our party and undermining the party’s governance,” Xi said, according to the People’s Daily transcript of his comments. “We should not bury our heads in the sand and spare these members but must make a resolute response to eliminate the problem and deter further violations.” The speech comes at a time of growing speculation over possible factional struggles within the 88 million-member Communist party that Xi has led since late 2012. As evidence of those rifts, experts point to recent moves by Xi to rein in the influential Communist Youth League, which is the power base of former president Hu Jintao and current prime minister Li Keqiang. This week it emerged that the Youth League’s budget had been slashed by more than 50% following a damning investigation into its activities by Xi’s anti-corruption agents. Experts also see Xi’s decision last month to take on the title of commander-in-chief of China’s joint battle command centre as a potential indicator of trouble at the top. Since coming to power Xi has amassed an unusual plethora of official titles including general secretary of the Communist party, president of the People’s Republic of China, chairman of the central military commission, leader of the national security commission and head of the leading group for overall reform. One academic has dubbed him the “chairman of everything”. Roderick MacFarquhar, a Harvard University expert in elite Communist party politics, said: “Xi Jinping’s donning of uniform and giving him his new military title is a warning to his colleagues that he has the army behind him. Whether he actually has or not, one doesn’t know. But that is his bulwark, as it was Mao’s.” However, MacFarquhar said the new title could be a sign of weakness rather than strength, noting that not even Mao Zedong had accumulated such a glut of titles. “Chairman Mao never needed titles. Everyone knew who was in charge,” he said. Xi has made a high-profile anti-corruption campaign one of his administration’s key missions, disciplining hundreds of thousands of officials, including top party and military figures. But experts say the war on corruption has generated discontent among officials, caused political paralysis and fuelled suspicions Xi is using the campaign as a pretext to purge his political enemies. In his recent speech, Xi denied those charges and vowed to “step up” the anti-corruption drive, according to Xinhua, China’s official news and propaganda agency. “We must make it clear that our party’s fight against corruption is not a snobbish affair that discriminates between different people, and it is not a House of Cards power struggle,” Xi said. Andrew Wedeman, a political scientist who is writing a book called Swatting Flies and Hunting Tigers: Xi Jinping’s War on Corruption, said continuing to pursue the campaign carried severe risks for China’s leader. “There is a certain point where the elite would want to wind this down because at the end of the day – as perhaps suggested by the revelations in the Panama Papers – there is enough guilt to go around among the leadership that if you really push this thing too far then an awful lot of people would be in trouble. “Given the extent of corruption, you can only push this thing so far without doing serious damage to the integrity and the unity of the party,” Wedeman added.",REAL
US Navy Seal killed by Isis in Iraq named as Charlie Keating IV,"Islamic State militants killed a US Navy Seal in northern Iraq on Tuesday, after blasting through Kurdish defenses and overrunning a town in the biggest offensive in the area for months, officials said. The elite serviceman was the third American to be killed in direct combat since a US-led coalition launched a campaign in 2014 to “degrade and destroy” Islamic State and is a measure of its deepening involvement in the conflict. “It is a combat death, of course, and a very sad loss,” the US defense secretary, Ash Carter, told reporters during a trip to Germany. The Seals are considered to be among the most able US special operations forces and capable of taking on dangerous missions. Governor Doug Ducey of Arizona identified the slain serviceman as Charlie Keating IV, and said Keating had attended high school in Phoenix. Keating’s grandfather, Charles H Keating Jr, who died in 2014 at age 90, was the notorious financier who served prison time for his role in the costliest savings and loan failure of the 1980s. A senior official within the Kurdish peshmerga forces facing Islamic State in northern Iraq said the man had been killed near the town of Tel Asqof, around 28km (17 miles) from the militant stronghold of Mosul. The Islamic State insurgents occupied the town at dawn on Tuesday but were driven out later in the day by the peshmerga. A US military official said the coalition had helped the peshmerga by conducting more than 20 air strikes with F-15 jets and drones. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Navy Seal was killed “by direct fire” while on a mission to advise and assist local forces in Iraq. Carter’s spokesman, Peter Cook, said the incident took place during an Islamic State attack on a peshmerga position some 3-5km behind the forward line. Underscoring the complicated nature of the US role in Iraq, the White House told reporters that even though the serviceman died in a combat situation, he was not on a combat mission. “He was not on the frontlines. But he was two miles away, and it turns out that being two miles away from the frontlines between Iraqi forces and Isil is a very dangerous place to be,” said the White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, using an acronym for Islamic State.",REAL
"Trump and Sanders win as Cruz shocks by dropping out – Indiana primary, as it happened","We’re going to wrap up our live coverage of the Indiana primaries shortly.

Bernie Sanders scored an upset victory over Hillary Clinton, though the two split the delegate pile. Sanders vowed the nominating race was not over.

John Kasich’s campaign said he was staying in: “Tonight’s results are not going to alter Governor Kasich’s campaign plans.” Cruz did not depart the national stage gracefully, exactly, elbowing his wife in the face on the way: Here are tomorrow’s local tabloid covers: The Indiana breakdown of pledged delegates could see Sanders gain seven. The state also will contribute nine unpledged delegates to the convention who could... reverse that: Turn out the lights... John Podesta, chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, has released a statement saying that Trump is not prepared to be president and is “too big of a risk”. Here’s the statement: Fundamentally, our next president will need to do two things: keep our nation safe in a dangerous world and help working families get ahead here at home. Donald Trump is not prepared to do either. Throughout this campaign, Donald Trump has demonstrated that he’s too divisive and lacks the temperament to lead our nation and the free world. With so much at stake, Donald Trump is simply too big of a risk. Hillary Clinton has proven that she has the strength to keep us safe in an uncertain world and a lifelong record of fighting to break down the barriers--economic and social--that hold working families back. While Donald Trump seeks to bully and divide Americans, Hillary Clinton will unite us to create an economy that works for everyone. Bernie Sanders’ speech tonight in Louisville was interrupted for a moment when it looked like he might have won Indiana. “Let’s hold off,” he said. “Not for sure.” He’s holding a 6-point margin with 86.7% reporting – visit our interactive results map here. Sanders has weighed in on his Indiana win. I understand that secretary Clinton thinks that this campaign is over. I’ve got some bad news for her. Sanders has now won primaries in 18 states. Is this OK? All jokes are off? Former presidential candidate and former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley has some choice words for Trump: The Guardian’s Ed Pilkington reports from Trump Tower on Trump’s makenice speech: Flanked by his wife Melania and children, with his controversial campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and convention manager Paul Manafort close by, Trump made an inclusive speech in which he tried to heal some of the open wounds of the past year and begin the long and very difficult process of unifying the party. He even said some kind words about his nemesis Cruz at the end of a day in which further ugly words had passed between the candidates. “I don’t know if he likes me or doesn’t like me,” he said of the senator for Texas. “But he is one hell of a competitor. He has an amazing future.” Trump also made soothing noises towards the Republican National Committee and its chairman Reince Preibus. “It’s not an easy job dealing with 17 egos,” referring to the initial crowded pack of Republican presidential hopefuls, before adding: “I guess he’s now down to one ego.” We’ll have a link to the full piece shortly. Clinton is hiring up for the general election: Cruz volunteers in Indianapolis pull off a self-evidently patriotic rendition of the national anthem with moments of near-harmony: The usually brash New York billionaire struck an unusually subdued tone in his speech. While the speech was somewhat “low energy”, it wasn’t lacking in attacks. These are now firmly centered on Hillary Clinton. In a preview of Trump’s general election strategy, and recognizing that any successful path for him relies on rust belt states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, Trump focused heavily on trade and jobs. Echoing his foreign policy speech that he delivered last week, Trump said his campaign was going to be about “America First” - a slogan that may be his general election equivalent of “Make America Great Again.” When it came to his former rival Ted Cruz, Trump was conciliatory, saying, “he is one hell of a competitor, he is a tough, smart guy.”As Trump was making his pitch for party unity, many high profile conservative activists on Twitter were continuing to say that they will never support a Trump candidacy. While it remains to be seen whether Trump can first unite the base and then reach out to win over independents and disaffected Democrats, one thing is certain: this election is going to be unlike anything we have ever seen before. On Twitter, at least. Here’s a sampler: Trump: “Sarah Palin has been from Day One, incredible. “Jerry Falwell Jr, from Liberty University... he’s a special guy. “Tonight I see I won with the evangelical voters.” More riffing: “We’re going to be saying Merry Christmas again.” And this is true of the Indiana returns: “I won with women. I love winning with women.” Then further good words for Cruz, who hours ago called Trump a “pathological liar” and “serial philanderer” after Trump tied Cruz’s father to the JFK assassination: I want to congratulate Ted Cruz. He is a tough, smart competitor. That’s it. Trump is done. Trump describes a vision of a country where people “cherish each other”: We’re going to love each other, we’re going to cherish each other, we’re going to take care of each other, and we’re going to have great economic development. Trump says he just spoke with Reince Priebus, the Republican party boss, who’s doing a great job. “I guess he’s down to one” from 17 candidates, Trump says. Kasich must be stewing at that line. “We want to bring unity to the Republican party. We have to bring unity. ... Many many people are calling, like you wouldn’t believe.” Hillary Clinton has begun fundraising off the Trump nomination: “We’re gonna win. We’re gonna win in November. And we’re gonna win big.” He promises “unbelievably good relationships with other countries” – Mexico? China? – “but they’re going to have to treat us fairly.” Bernie Sanders has defeated Hillary Clinton in Indiana, the AP projects. Awkward. But that’s not new to this race. It appears they’ll split the 83 pledged delegates closely. “The American people understand that coming together always trumps dividing us up,” Sanders said earlier tonight. Trump: I’ve competed all my life... All my life I’ve been in competitions, different competitions... and I have to tell you that I have met some of the most incredible competitors right here in the Republican party... Ted Cruz, I don’t know if he likes me or doesn’t like me. But he is one hell of a competitor. He is a tough, smart, guy. And he has got an amazing future. I want to congratulate Ted. I know how tough it is. It’s tough... I understand how Ted feels and Heidi, and their whole beautiful family. I want to just say though, one tough competitor. Trump: “Hillary Clinton, she will not be a great president, she will not be a good president. She will be a poor president. She does not understand trade. Her husband signed, perhaps, in the history of the world, the single worst trade deal ever done. It’s called Nafta.” “I’ve witnessed what it’s done really firsthand, and it has been indeed carnage.” “We’re going to bring back our jobs and we’re going to keep our jobs. We’re not going to let companies leave.” Trump is mellow in victory, speaking in even tones, conversationally, just riffing. “We’re going to Nebraska where I just hear we’re doing really wonderfully... and West Virginia. We’re going to get those miners back to work.” Now he hits Clinton, who had talked about closing mines but then apologized in West Virginia. for saying that. “Let me tell you,” Trump says, “the miners in Pennsylvania and West Virginia are going to start to work again. You’re going to be proud again to be miners.” Trump says when he got back to New York tonight and started watching the networks, he realized he could win all 57 delegates in Indiana. “I must say, in staying in various places in Indiana, I turned on the television and all I saw was negative ads.” “It was the same as Florida. 60,000 negative ads, most of which are absolutely false and disgusting. ... And the people are so smart, they don’t buy it, they get it.” Trump thanks his wife, kids, late parents and brother. He sounds pleased. “It’s been some unbelievable day, evening and year...I’ve never been through anything like this... it’s a beautiful thing to behold and we’re going to make America great again.” Here’s that video stream again: The chairman of the Republican national committee says that Trump will nab the nomination and calls for party unity (if he botches the spelling a bit): For Ted Cruz, the End is Now. The senator said he expected to win in Indiana. Just the other day, he told voters: “it gives me great comfort that this primary is going to be decided by the Midwestern common sense of the Hoosier State.” Cruz was right, Indiana has decided the Republican primary. Unfortunately for Cruz the state has decided Donald Trump is the nominee. After being beaten handily by Trump - all but guaranteeing Trump will now secure the 1,237 delegates necessary to secure the nomination on the first ballot - Ted Cruz said he is ending his campaign for president. In his concession speech, Cruz, perhaps with an eye to 2020, sounded more like a man on the cusp of accepting his party’s nomination than one who was announcing the end of his campaign. After lengthy speech outlining his vision for the country, Cruz declared, “with a heavy heart, but with boundless optimism for the future, we are suspending our campaign for president”. Cruz’s declaration is an admission that he no longer had a path to victory in his fight against Trump. Interestingly, missing from Cruz’s extended remarks was any reference to the now presumptive nominee of the Republican Party: Donald Trump. It is clear that Cruz has ended his fight for the nomination. But don’t think he has ended his fight with the billionaire businessman. While we wait for Trump – what’s happening on the Democratic side? With 60.8% reporting, Bernie Sanders leads Hillary Clinton 53.1%–46.9%. Precincts late to report include some in northwestern Lake County, which is favorable to Clinton – but maybe not favorable enough. Our comprehensive results map is here: We’re expecting to hear from the highly likely nominee shortly. Live video feed will come online here: The Guardian’s Ed Pilkington is at Trump Tower: Cruz winds to a close: In this fight for the long-term future of America, there is no substitute for victory. There is no substitute for the America that each of us loves with all of our heart… Thank you to each of you, and god bless you. Cruz is done. Cruz thanks his mom and dad, and then “Carly Fiorina, who has been an incredible, phenomenal running mate” – for six days now. Cruz: What you have done, the movement that you have started is extraordinary. From the beginning, I’ve said that I would continue on … Tonight, I’m sorry to say, it appears that path has been foreclosed. “No!” his supporters shout. Cruz: We gave it everything we’ve got, but the voters chose another path … With a heavy heart, but with boundless optimism for the long-term future of our nation, we are suspending our campaign. As news of his campaign suspension breaks, Cruz continues to speak – he has not actually said it yet. Here it comes: Thanks to each of you. Incredible patriots who have fought so hard to save our nation. I am so grateful to you. To my amazing wife Heidi. To our precious girls... Ted Cruz suspended his campaign on Tuesday after a crushing defeat in Indiana’s primary, reports Ben Jacobs: The Texas senator, who rose to fame with his quixotic 17-day attempt to shut down the government, was the last remaining competitor to Donald Trump with a clear shot at the nomination. However, after staking his campaign on a win in Indiana, Cruz suffered an overwhelming loss in the Hoosier state. Cruz leaves the race having won 565 delegates and 11 states, including the first in the nation Iowa caucuses. Despite successfully building a strong base among evangelicals and social conservatives, he was unable to expand his following and to pivot to the unpredictable Trump, who repeatedly bashed him as “lyin’ Ted”. Ted Cruz is suspending his presidential campaign, the Guardian’s Ben Jacobs has confirmed. It appears those two Trump tweets from about 90 minutes ago really hit the mark. Happy! Cruz is speaking in the broadest possible terms about the challenges facing Republicans, future generations, the “tyranny of political correctness”, founding values – all the kinds of things you might say if you were announcing the suspension of your presidential campaign. Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts: Cruz is talking about how far he’s come, how he’s lived the American dream, how his father was a “teenage immigrant washing dishes”. “Only in America,” Cruz says. Which is not the same as “onward to West Virginia”. Cruz says people have been talking about a contested convention, and the last one 40 years ago. At the time, he says, Ronald Reagan “spoke of the next 100 years”, looking to the distant not the near horizon. Ronald Reagan spoke with a purpose … that must unite and drive our party now. Americans are deeply frustrated and desperately want to change the path that we’re on. Cruz is striking a valedictory tone in this speech. He is – unusually for an election night – reading from a teleprompter. America is hopeful, optimistic,. We are not boastful or mean-spirited. America is brave. We keep our word. And we believe in peace through strength. What is Cruz trying to say here? Hmm... Carly Fiorina warms up the crowd for Cruz. She says she speaks for the Cruz family and team when she says “how many Hoosiers we have fallen in love with on this campaign”. Live stream here. The Guardian’s Ed Pilkington sends a dispatch from Trump Tower, where he’s in position to catch the victor’s speech, expected in about 40 minutes. “The Trump inner circle is already turning up the heat on Ted Cruz to drop out of the race in the wake of the resounding Indiana result,” Ed reports: I’ve just been talking to Eric Trump, the billionaire’s son, as we wait for the candidate to make his victory speech back on home turf in Trump Tower. The 32-year-old son of Donald Trump and his first wife Ivana let rip to the Guardian about the senator for Texas. At the end of a long day in which the ugly war of words between the two presidential hopefuls reached new lows, the younger Trump said that Cruz had ‘zero road ahead’. ‘Truth be told, if Ted Cruz stays in the race he will be doing it for his own selfish reasons and not for the good of the party,’ Eric said. ‘We should be turning our attention to Hillary Clinton and beating the Democrats in November, but instead we will have to keep focusing on a guy who has lost the entire east coast and south of the country, who is three-and-a-half million votes behind, 500 delegates behind and has zero chance of getting the nomination.’ You know that something extraordinary has happened tonight when you hear the Trump team talking about ‘the good of the Republican party’. As a parting shot, I asked Eric whether we could now expect his father to adopt a new tone as he heads into the general election. He paused, and then he said: ‘I think my father will now start turning his attention to her. It’s time for Hillary.’ A politician’s answer. Are we seeing another American dynasty – Kennedy, Bush, Clinton … Trump – in the making? We’re expecting to hear from Ted Cruz in Indianapolis any moment now. Watch him live here: Sanders adopts a line from Clinton, about love trumping hate. This sounds an awful lot like a first step to party unity: We are stronger. And the American people understand that coming together always trumps dividing us up. Sanders goes on to say that generosity trumps selfishness and “at the end of the day, love always Trumps hatred”. We’re already heard from a top architect of the 2008 John McCain campaign, Steve Schmidt, who says it’s “100%” that Trump will be the nominee. Now here’s a top architect of the 2012 Mitt Romney campaign: Trump’s next move: West Virginia. The Mountain State votes, along with Nebraska, in one week. Thirty-four Republican delegates awarded on a proportional basis will be at stake. Trump is polling very well there. Hoosier daddy. Not bad, Post: Steve Schmidt was a George W Bush adviser and lead strategist on the 2008 John McCain presidential campaign. He said very early on, when most people were writing Trump off, that Trump could win the Republican nomination. Now he says he was right: Here’s the view, meanwhile, from the Democratic political professional side: One unavoidable take-away tonight is that voters really, really don’t like Ted Cruz, notes Lucia Graves Trump has said of Cruz, “everybody hates Ted” when they get to know him. Like many of Trump’s attacks, it’s nasty but there’s truth to it. John Boehner lent further credence to the notion last week when he referred to the senator from Texas as “Lucifer in the flesh” last week. Now it appears Indiana voters feel the same way as lawmakers: having gotten to know him, they don’t like him too much. No sooner had the polls closed than it became apparent Trump was going to win again and by a landslide. This after Cruz had been polling relatively well in the state until recently. His dip in the polls, tellingly if you ask Trump, coincides with the time when he started campaigning intensively in the state. And he did try everything, driving home his conservative bonafides, signing a non-aggression pact with John Kasich, and even declaring a vice presidential pick early to attract attention. He spent enough money to ensure the voters heard him loud and clear – they just, like so many others before them, didn’t like what they heard one bit. Sanders continues his speech in Louisville. It’s his straight stump speech so far, declaring that “now is the time for Wall Street to help the middle class of this country”: A great nation is not judged by the number of billionaires and nuclear weapons it has. A great nation is judged by how it treats the most vulnerable and weak among us. No inflection so far referring to the tight race in Indiana or what it might mean, as whatever happens, Sanders is expected to chug through to the final contest in Washington DC on 14 June. A live video feed of the Sanders speech is in a block from 15 minutes ago. For the good of what party? With 17.3% reporting, it was an even 50-50 race on the Democratic side. But now Sanders has pulled ahead by a couple of tenths of a percent. Follow along here: *low whistle* Here’s another sample from conservatives populating the land of #NeverTrump: Our Principles Pac, the conservative anti-Trump force, holds out hope for a contested convention, in a statement issued to reporters: “While tonight’s Indiana primary results increased Donald Trump’s delegate count, Trump remains short of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the GOP nomination,” said OPP chair Katie Packer. A substantial number of delegates remain up for grabs in this highly unpredictable year. In addition, there is more than a month before the California primary – more time for Trump to continue to disqualify himself in the eyes of voters, as he did yet again today spreading absurd tabloid lies about Ted Cruz’s father and the JFK assassination. [...] We will continue to educate voters about Trump until he, or another candidate, wins the support of a majority of delegates to the Convention. Bernie Sanders is addressing supporters in Louisville, Kentucky. The below live video feed should come online shortly. So far it’s straight stump from Sanders. Donald Trump is scheduled to discuss tonight’s victory at Trump Tower in Manhattan starting at 9pm ET. Ed Pilkington will be on the ground ... Donald Trump has beaten Ted Cruz in the Indiana primary, ending the best hope of blocking a presidential nomination the Texas senator has claimed will plunge America into the political “abyss”, write the Guardian’s Ben Jacobs and Dan Roberts: Despite a day of dire warnings from Trump’s conservative rival, the New York businessman was declared victor by the Associated Press within seconds of polls closing in the Hoosier state. With the second highest number of delegates left on offer before the Republican party convention, Indiana offered a chance for Cruz to repeat his success in Iowa and Wisconsin by urging midwest voters to reject Trump. “The country is depending on Indiana,” he warned on Tuesday. “If Indiana does not act, this country could well plunge into the abyss … We are not a proud, boastful, self-centered, mean spirited, hateful, bullying nation.” But by winning the 30 delegates awarded to Indiana’s statewide winner, Trump now has an easy path to claiming the 1,237 pledged delegates needed to avoid a contested convention in Cleveland and win outright, and is well-positioned even if Cruz pulls off an upset in delegate-rich California next month. Read our full news coverage here: The governor John Kasich campaign has released a statement vowing not to let mere results alter the candidate’s steadfast commitment to somehow winning the nomination with 153 delegates (and counting?). “Tonight’s results are not going to alter Gov. Kasich’s campaign plans,” the statement begins, continuing: Our strategy has been and continues to be one that involves winning the nomination at an open convention. The comments from Trump, on the verge of winning in Indiana, heighten the differences between Governor Kasich and his positive, inclusive approach and the disrespectful ramblings from Donald Trump. The statement includes a colorful reference to “the Mad Hatter Gibberish pushed by Trump during the primary,” which Kasich believes “would weaken America.” So much for a contested convention: Trump continues to use the moment of his victory to punch Cruz, making sure he finishes the job with his opponent on the canvas: Trump is picking off district after district, snapping up at least 45 delegates in Indiana and angling for all 57: Indiana just confirmed everyone’s worst fears, says Guardian US contributor Christopher R Barron. Indiana is Waterloo for Ted Cruz and the #NeverTrump Forces. For weeks, the campaign of Senator Ted Cruz and Trump’s opponents circled today on the calendar. Indiana was where they were making their last stand. Like Wisconsin - where Cruz won - Indiana was meant to be friendlier territory for Cruz, somewhere he could focus his time and efforts. After a huge loss in New York to Donald Trump and devastating losses in the so-called Acela primaries across the mid-Atlantic, it was hoped that Indiana would be the state where Donald Trump was stopped. That’s not how it worked out. Instead of stopping Trump, the Indiana primary became an electoral graveyard. The anti-Trump movement poured millions into the state, Cruz fully brought to bear his vaunted ground game, he convinced rival John Kasich to not campaign in the state, he picked Carly Fiorina as his “running mate,” and was even endorsed by Governor Mike Pence. At the end of the day, none of it mattered. Trump won and he won big. Trump’s big win in Indiana now makes Trump the presumptive Republican nominee. Guardian politics reporter Ben Jacobs is fanboating over the exit results and pulling in the good bits. He notes that Hoosier men went big for Trump while the race was tight among women... ...Trump struggled with educated voters... ... but Trump performed better than usual among relatively affluent voters and not as well among low-income voters (he nevertheless won both groups): In his moment of victory – like literally at the minute of his definitive victory in the presidential nominating competition – Trump tweets not celebration but slams Cruz: An immediate call in Indiana for Trump on the Republican side – and it appears there may be a possibility of a Trump delegate sweep. Donald Trump is the likely 2016 Republican presidential nominee. That’s not a technical term. It’s still possible it won’t happen. But. Guardian US columnist Lucia Graves wonders whether tonight holds any surprises for Bernie Sanders, who is sticking in the race with a fighting spirit. Hillary Clinton may have moved on to campaign in the general election, but Bernie Sanders isn’t giving up – and he’s hoping Indiana will tell the world tonight that his voters aren’t either. While Sanders is overwhelmingly predicted to lose, the work and money he’s spending in Indiana suggest his team thinks he can perform better than expected. The Vermont senator has a number of factors working in his favor tonight, including, crucially, that it’s an open primary, meaning Independents are allowed to vote. The Sanders campaign spent generously in the days and weeks leading up to tonight’s primary and they did it at a time when team Clinton had essentially moved on. Clinton tellingly spent zero money on advertising in Indiana while Sanders spent $1.5m, and she’s spent minimal time campaigning there. Clinton further signaled her confidence by spending the day leading up to the election in Ohio – a state that has already voted in the primary and is useful to her only in so far as it pertains to the general. With just under 5% of votes reporting, tonight’s Democratic race is shaping up to be a tight one. And while Clinton has the edge on Sanders thus far, early voting characteristically favors Clinton, whose campaign is better organized. The math of the primary election may clear, but Sanders’ constituency isn’t done talking yet. With the closure of the final polling stations in Indiana in about five minutes, we are expected quickly to have at least one projected winner. Ben Jacobs is in the room with team Cruz, where the senator’s supporters are chanting at the TV: Don’t make the mistake of neglecting our results page – we’re at 2.5% reporting now on both sides, from mostly rural precincts, and Clinton and Trump appear to be performing well: What will we learn when the last of the Indiana polls close in just 20 minutes? We haven’t even had time to order pizza yet! Roger Stone, the former Donald Trump adviser, current Trump ally and longtime Republican bruiser, tweets that CNN’s Jake Tapper, in the spot we linked to earlier, is wrong about Ted Cruz’s father and, by the way, Lee Harvey Oswald did not kill Kennedy: Ted Cruz for president, down to 2% in betting pools. Not down by 2%. Down to 2%. Here are a few good #ffs for snap results analysis: Forty precincts have now reported on each side – that’s less than 1% reporting. Needless to say that’s not a large enough proportion to base a projection on. But not bad for Trump, it appears: Visit our comprehensive mapped results page here: Why would the Associated Press be circulating a video explaining how they might call a race in Indiana immediately as polls close? Hmmm ... One precinct has let fly its results early. And Clinton holds a 228-vote lead in Indiana. Count it. Here’s Nate Cohn with a good reminder of why exit polls can be misleading: they don’t encompass early votes – hundreds of thousands of them, in Indiana’s case tonight: Donald Trump is a friend of mine. – Senator Ted Cruz, 7/18/15 Polling stations in 80 of 92 counties in Indiana are about to close. What’s done is (almost) done. Update: to be clear: I t appears there is no way that Ted Cruz might leave the race tonight or any night soon: Update: Cruz suspends campaign: “It appears that path [to victory] has been foreclosed.” Appearances are everything! Correction: this post has been updated to reflect that some results will land before 7pm ET. Here is the kind of exit poll tidbit that an eyebrow might be raised at but which on the other hand might mean diddly depending on the reliability of the data which might be nil: “Many supporters of each candidate wouldn’t consider ultimately voting for the other,” writes Guardian politics reporter Ben Jacobs: Michael Strawn, a 52-year-old mortgage banker from Carmel, Indiana, who supports Cruz, told the Guardian: “Donald Trump scares me. He is unpredictable and self-centered.” A lifelong Republican, Strawn said he would have a hard time voting for Trump if he was the nominee. “I know what the worst case is with Hillary. I don’t like it but I can manage. With Trump I just don’t know.” In contrast, Danny Buechler of Greenfield not only couldn’t imagine voting for Cruz, but he couldn’t imagine voting for anyone besides Trump. The long-bearded biker, who wore a black cowboy hat with “Trump” written in silver, said he had last voted for Richard Nixon in 1968. To him, the Republican frontrunner represented “truth and change”, and Buechler took reassurance in the fact that the mogul “ain’t a politician yet”. Read the full piece here: If you like results but don’t like waiting, you’re in luck, because exit poll data is now trickling out. The data have been collected by interviewers outside polling stations across Indiana on behalf of a consortium of media outlets, and the data might shed light on the demographic and ideological breakdowns of today’s electorate, which information then might be extrapolated to judge the candidates’ potential performances, is how it works. You can root through the data for kernels of potential insight here, but be warned – those kernels might in fact be misleading nonsense, the result of bad voter sampling or inaccurate self-reporting by voters. Still, it is interesting to contemplate that the proportion of #NeverTrump voters in the Republican race may have been smaller, actually, than the proportion of voters who said they were #NeverCruz: Read @SteveKornacki for more. 3 May 2016 witnessed some of the most outlandish lines ever to surface in the national political discourse, which is saying something. Donald Trump started things off by calling into Fox News and giving credence to a months-old story in the National Enquirer – think celebrity alien baby births and John Edwards’ affair – that Ted Cruz’s father, Rafael Cruz Sr., had been captured on camera with Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated president John F Kennedy. “What was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the death, I mean before the shooting?” Trump said. (There’s no reason apart from the sterling journalistic reputation of the Enquirer, which has endorsed Trump and is published by a friend of Trump’s, to believe the man in the picture in question is indeed Cruz’s father.) Cruz replied in a midday news conference that snowballed into a full-throated condemnation of Trump, whom Cruz called a “pathological liar” and a “serial philanderer” whose “battles with venereal disease” were not the kind of thing Americans would like their teenagers to contemplate. Here’s Cruz’s sizzler: Trump hit back, saying Cruz was in the last throes of a “desperate” attempt to save his “failing campaign,” accusing him of a “ridiculous outburst” and saying he did not “have the temperament to be president.” The end. Take it away CNN’s Jake Tapper: Our comprehensive interactive map-glamorous results page is now live here. Veterans of this process know that the interactive is a great place to go if you want to compare Trump’s performance in the Indianapolis metropolitan area, say, with his results in the more rural southern part of the state or the industrial strip along the I-80 corridor up north. Also, there are animated candidates riding scissors lifts and wielding paintbrushes to tag territory where they’re ahead. Check it out: Guardian politics reporter Ben Jacobs is in Indianapolis tonight, where he will watch Ted Cruz deliver a speech after the results are in. From there, Cruz heads west: Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the Indiana primaries, where Donald Trump is hoping to kick his ankles free of Ted Cruz’s teeth, and Hillary Clinton is hoping to avoid another unseemly Bernie Sanders win. The stakes on the Republican side tonight cannot be overstated. If Trump wins the 30 delegates that Indiana awards the victor in the state’s popular vote (the winners in each of the state’s nine congressional districts receive three delegates apiece), only a huge upset by Cruz in California next month could stop Trump from obtaining the 1,237 pledged delegates needed to clinch the nomination. Tonight’s the night that Donald Trump could become the likely 2016 Republican presidential nominee. Polling averages have Trump up by double digits in the Hoosier state, while Clinton holds a smaller and less extensively surveyed lead over Sanders (with 83 pledged delegates to be awarded on the Democratic side). But Clinton, who holds a prohibitive lead in the delegate race, is already leaving the primary season behind and training her fire on Trump: Most polling stations in Indiana, which straddles two time zones, close at 6pm ET, with the remainder closing at 7pm ET. In 2012, half the Indiana vote had been reported by 8pm ET, and 95% by 10pm ET, according to the Associated Press. A very high rate of absentee ballots, which were requested in unusual volume, have been returned in Indiana, NBC News reported. It was a strange day on the campaign trail, even for the 2016 cycle, with Trump starting off by linking Cruz’s father to the JFK assassination and Cruz trotting out an old Trump quote about venereal disease. We’ll bring you a recap of that action shortly – or you can scroll through today’s Campaign Minute or enjoy Scott Bixby’s daytime live blog. As usual, we’ll be tracking the results on our interactive maps tool and bringing you the headline returns here as soon as they come in. Do you think Sanders will pull off an upset? Is there any chance of Cruz doing the same? Wherefore John Kasich?

Police across the world take up 'running man' recruitment dance challenge,"The New Zealand police force has released a video of officers doing the “running man” dance and issued a challenge to other forces around the world to do the same in an unorthodox recruitment drive. The 30-second clip, dubbed the #runningmanchallenge, is part of a year-long campaign by the New Zealand police force, which wants to sign up 400 new officers by the end of 2016, particularly of Maori, Pacific Island, Asian, Middle Eastern and Indian descent. In the video eight police officers in uniform dance in a basement car park. A post on the force’s Facebook page that accompanies the video reads: “We catch people on the run everyday, this was a new #runningmanchallenge for our team.” International police forces tagged in the post included those in Australia, the US and the UK. On Wednesday afternoon the New York City Police Department (NYPD) accepted the challenge and created their own video on a soggy pier in front of the Brooklyn Bridge. Already watched nearly a million times, the NYPD recruited six local kids to help them one-up the Kiwis. In their video the NYPD challenged The New York City Fire Department, Boston Police Department and Police Scotland to take up the challenge. The LAPD also responded to New Zealand’s challenge but are yet to post a video. Meanwhile in Australia, the Northern Territory police are “ actively considering” creating a video, and Victoria state police commissioner Graham Ashton tweeted “Nice effort@nzpolice - leave it with us...” However, the Isles of Scilly police have ruled out taking part. In a Facebook post, sergeant Colin “dad dance” Taylor said dance was not his team’s strong point. “I note that the gauntlet has been laid down by [New Zealand police] for a dance off with us. “I also note that they can draw on a supporting cast of thousands of officers and staff whereas we have a modest team of five and occasionally a cat. Our combined age on this small rock in the Atlantic (including feline years) is over 300.” “We wish NZ Police the very best with their recruitment drive. It certainly is a remarkable career even if you have to do it upside down dancing on the ceiling.” The New Zealand video, which was posted on Facebook on Tuesday, has been viewed nearly four million times. The star of the clip, 43-year-old Sergeant Sonny Joseph Iosefo, became a police officer 20 years ago after following family members into the force. Iosefo said he had a “lifelong passion for dance” and would often dance at family picnics and at home with his wife and six-year-old son. “If we can make someone laugh on the street, that makes our job so much easier,” he said. “We are trying to get away from the stereotypes the public hold about police officers, that they can’t talk to us, that we are really serious people. We want people to know that we are humans too, we have families, we have children, and some of us love to dance.” Iosefa said the dance moves he and his fellow uniformed officers used in the video clip were “a little bit Samoan inspired” as per his cultural history. “Dance is embedded in our blood and our culture, and I like to bring that out. Trying to connect with young people, and trying to diffuse tension, it really helps if you can make someone smile. “We want a diverse force that is part of the community, not just policing it.”",REAL
Angélique Kidjo honoured with Amnesty International top human rights award,"Amnesty International has given its top 2016 human rights award to Grammy award-winning musician Angélique Kidjo and to three African youth activist movements for their work standing up to injustice, the organisation announced on Wednesday. Benin-born Kidjo and groups Y’en a Marre from Senegal, Le Balai Citoyen from Burkina Faso and Lutte pour le Changement (LUCHA) from the Democratic Republic of Congo have shown “exceptional courage,” Amnesty said. “[They] have all proved themselves to be bold advocates for human rights, using their talents to inspire others,” Salil Shetty, Amnesty’s secretary general, said. Previous winners of the Ambassador of Conscience award include the late South African leader Nelson Mandela, Myanmar politician Aung San Suu Kyi and the rock band U2. Last year it was awarded to Chinese artist Ai Weiwei and American singer-songwriter Joan Baez. Kidjo fled her homeland in the 1980s after being pressured to perform for the country’s repressive regime. In a 30-year career spawning 12 albums, she has been a prominent campaigner for freedom of expression and against female genital mutilation. Y’en a Marre (Fed Up) is a group of Senegalese rappers and journalists who joined forces in 2011 to encourage young people to register to vote in the country’s election, and to exercise their right to freedom of expression. Y’en a Marre has remained active since the election, hosting meetings and urging the new government to implement promised changes such as land reform, a key issue affecting Senegal’s rural poor. Le Balai Citoyen (The Citizen’s Broom) is a political grassroots movement committed to peaceful protest. It was founded in 2013 by two musicians, reggae artist Sams’K Le Jah and rapper Smockey (Serge Bambara). The group has voiced concerns about a range of issues from corruption and land grabs to power cuts, and it has mobilised people to claim their rights and fight impunity. LUCHA is another community-based youth movement committed to peaceful protest. It was created in Goma, eastern DRC, in 2012. Its activism focuses on social issues, human rights and the protection of civilians from armed groups. LUCHA advocates for social justice and democratic governance through non-partisan and non-violent actions. Kidjo and her fellow awardees will be honoured at a ceremony in Dakar, Senegal, on May 28.",REAL
Poll shows UK business confidence at four-year low,"Worries about the EU referendum in June, rising labour costs and China’s slowdown have knocked UK business confidence to a four-year low, according to a report that will fan fears the economy is losing momentum. A poll of 1,000 chartered accountants by their professional body, the ICAEW, echoed other recent surveys pointing to fragile consumer and business confidence as the referendum approaches. The poll also noted a slowdown in domestic sales and nervousness about hiring new staff. The main reading on the ICAEW/Grant Thornton UK business confidence monitor dropped to 0.8 from 11.4 in the previous quarter and was the lowest since early 2012 when economic growth was grinding to a halt. The report pointed to several factors weighing on sentiment and predicted economic growth will slow further in the coming months. The latest official data showed GDP growth had already dipped to 0.4% in the first quarter from 0.6% in the final three months of 2015. “Business confidence is fragile and there is an absence of resilience in the UK economy at the moment. A combination of factors has led to this negativity and includes the EU referendum, slowing domestic sales, Chinese growth slackening and the recent budget,” said the ICAEW chief executive, Michael Izza. “Businesses cannot plan with confidence and this applies regardless of sector, ownership or size of company. Weakening growth will also mean lower tax receipts for the chancellor, making it even harder for him to meet his deficit goal.” The group said the latest drop in confidence suggested GDP will expand just 0.3% in the second April-to-June quarter. That chimes with a recent Bank of England prediction that growth will likely falter as companies defer spending decisions until after the 23 June referendum, which polls suggest will be close run. The survey of chartered accountants found companies’ export sales had improved thanks to a weaker pound, which makes UK goods cheaper for overseas buyers. But it said sales growth in the UK had “slowed significantly”. It highlighted new costs for employers from the recently introduced national living wage and auto-enrolment rules on pensions. The poll found skill shortages were less of a problem for businesses than 12 months ago but that employment was expected to slow this year. Salaries were predicted to rise by 2% over the next year. There were further signs of pay pressures in separate figures showing salaries listed in job adverts had flatlined in March. The jobs search website Adzuna said political uncertainty appeared to be making employers more cautious as it reported that the average advertised salary was £33,815 in March, unchanged from February and down 2% on a year earlier. Adzuna’s jobs market report, which is based on all online job adverts in the UK, found that in all regions, except Northern Ireland, advertised salaries fell year-on-year in March. “It’s a time of turbulence for the jobs market. Unemployment is climbing and political uncertainty could well be impacting hiring plans,” said Adzuna’s co-founder, Doug Monro. “In particular, recent reports indicate hiring permanent staff may be being put on pause until after the EU referendum as employers turn to temporary workers to fill gaps.”",REAL
Alistair Darling: leaving EU could put £250bn of UK export trade at risk,"Leaving the EU could put £250bn of British trade at risk, former chancellor of the exchequer Alistair Darling has claimed, saying negotiating new free-trade deals with key export markets could take an average of six years. Britain exports £637bn worth of goods and services to other EU member states and more than 50 countries with which the EU has free trade agreements (FTAs), according to analysis for Britain Stronger in Europe, the official campaign to keep Britain in the EU at the 23 June referendum. Switching to less preferential World Trade Organisation rules – the stopgap arrangement Brexit campaigners suggest would be in place while talks on new trade deals get under way – could jeopardise more than a third of that trade, or £250bn, as tariffs on British exports increased, the campaign claimed. “Those wanting to leave the EU want to pull Britain out of the single market, which would mean introducing tariffs and barriers to our trade and putting billions of vital trade at risk,” Darling said. “There is no trading arrangement outside the EU that gives us the free trade we rely on today. Leaving would put jobs, low prices and financial security at risk.” Looking at all the FTAs negotiated by the EU since 1974, the average time taken to reach a deal was six years, the campaign found, underlining the challenge facing Britain if it sought to put in place new deals after leaving the EU. The deal with Albania – which has been cited by some in Vote Leave as an indication of the kind of relationship Britain might hope to achieve – took six years to negotiate; Israel’s took eight years and Macedonia’s almost five. The former chancellor is the latest in a series of politicians and economists, including Barack Obama, lined up by the remain campaign to encourage voters to reject the risks of ditching EU membership. However, Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott accused the remain campaign of underestimating the UK’s ability to make its way in the world. “Britain Stronger in Europe can’t even be consistent or honest in their campaign to do down the British economy. Their underlying belief appears to be that Britain – the world’s fifth largest economy and a nation with a great history of trading across the globe – would be an economic backwater if it wasn’t for Brussels taking control of our trade deals. That’s absurd.” While the remain camp continues to focus primarily on the economic risks of Brexit, former EU commissioner Peter Mandelson accused leave campaigners of playing on fears about immigration, as they struggled to win over swing voters. Writing in the Guardian, Mandelson accused the justice secretary, Michael Gove, the chair of the Leave campaign, of “putting truth to one side” for an article he wrote in Saturday’s Daily Mail warning of the risks of uncontrolled immigration, and the likelihood that Turkey will join the EU. Mandelson said Vote Leave began the campaign determined to stick to the safer ground of the economy and leave migration to Nigel Farage, whose Ukip party has its own Leave campaign, Grassroots Out. But he claimed that as Vote Leave has struggled to win the argument, and the remain camp has edged ahead in the polls, they have decided to switch their tactics. “From Johnson questioning President Obama’s ‘part-Kenyan ancestry’ to EU immigrants being blamed for the problems in everything from British schools to our health service to our prisons, every recent Vote Leave intervention has had immigration at its heart,” Mandelson said.",REAL
'America is a better country without you': Ted Cruz's very bad day,"Politicians who run for president are used to scorn, mockery and a healthy skepticism from the American people. But few have been heckled by a 12-year-old, questioned about their Canadian birth, or had their spouse field questions about their resemblance to a serial killer. All in one day. Ted Cruz suffered all this and more on Monday in Indiana, a state where he desperately needs to do well if he wants to preserve any hope of winning the Republican nomination for president. Simple arithmetic eliminated Cruz from an outright victory two weeks ago, but he has clung to the possibility that he could deny Donald Trump the 1,237 delegates a candidate needs to win the primary election. Indiana and California are the two largest states that could tilt the race in favor of a contested convention, in which Cruz would have a chance of beating Trump. But Cruz, called “Lucifer in the flesh” by one of his former colleagues in Congress last week, found little more love in Indiana than in Washington. The trouble started with a 12-year-old in La Porte, Indiana. At a rally there, a boy shouted “You suck!” and “Shut up!” during Cruz’s stump speech, thwarting the senator’s attempts to turn the pubescent heckler into a talking point. “You know, one of the things that hopefully someone has told you is that children should speak with respect,” Cruz said. “Imagine what a different world it would be if someone had told Donald Trump that, years ago.” Eventually he gave up, saying: “In my household, when a child behaves that way they get a spanking.” Police escorted the boy away, shouts of “shut up” continuing. Later, Cruz was confronted near his campaign bus by supporters of his rival, who gleefully shouted “Lyin’ Ted!” at the senator from a few feet away, using Trump’s preferred nickname for Cruz. Trump has bestowed pet names on each of his rivals – “Little Marco” Rubio, “Crooked Hillary” Clinton and “Comrade” Bernie Sanders, for instance – and has reminded his fans repeatedly that Ted Cruz was recently a dual Canadian American citizen. “You’ll find out tomorrow,” the Trump supporter said. “Indiana don’t want you.” The Princeton alumnus and champion debater tried to engage. “The question everyone here should ask ... ” “Are you Canadian?” the voter asked, to titters from the crowd. Then: “Where’s your Goldman Sachs jacket?” an allusion to the employer of Cruz’s wife. Always a lawyer – and one who has argued successfully before the supreme court – Cruz tried a different tack: an appeal to civility. “If I were Donald Trump, I wouldn’t have come over to talk to you,” he said. “Sir, America is a better country ... ” “Without you!” “Thank you for those kind sentiments,” he said. “I respect your right to speak but I’m also going to say in America we are a nation that is better than anger and insults and cursing and rage. And I believe the people in Indiana have common sense and good judgement and want real solu – ” “Woo! Vote Trump! Woo!” the voter screamed, followed by others in the crowd. Cruz spun on his heels and walked away. Cruz’s allies did not have much a better day. His wife, Heidi, was asked by Yahoo News to comment on a string of jokes at this weekend’s White House correspondents dinner, made at her husband’s expense. On Saturday, the comedian Larry Wilmore invoked an internet meme that pretends the senator is the Zodiac Killer, the enigmatic and never-captured murderer who puzzled authorities with coded notes and claimed to have killed several people in the late 1960s and early 70s. “Well, I’ve been married to him for 15 years and I know pretty well who he is, so it doesn’t bother me at all. There’s a lot of garbage out there,” Heidi Cruz said. Elsewhere, Cruz’s would-be running mate, Carly Fiorina, slipped off a stage at a rally as Cruz obliviously continued to shake supporters’ hands. Trump later commented: “Cruz didn’t do anything; even I would have helped her ... That was a weird deal.” There was no report of any injury, but internet comedians quickly seized on her literal pratfall, as well as a strange, fumbling hand clasp she attempted with Cruz. Nor could the Cruz campaign find any comfort in the polls. Averages show Cruz tanking: down 14 points to Trump, while John Kasich hovers around 11%, without enough support to make up for Cruz’s deficit even if all of Kasich’s voters suddenly defected to the Texan. Trump needs about 45% of the remaining delegates in order to reach 1,237, CBS estimates – a viable possibility, considering his good chances in California, the state with the most delegates. But Cruz insisted that even without Indiana, he “absolutely” had a path to the nomination, defying the cries of Trump supporters to “do the math”. Nor do Americans in general seem to be taking a liking to Cruz, even though a recent Washington Post-ABC poll shows that 67% of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of Trump. Fifty-three per cent of Americans dislike Cruz. A March poll found that 52% of Americans have unfavorable opinions of Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee.

Saudi Arabia labels reports of divestment from US assets 'ridiculous',"Reports that Saudi Arabia is threatening to withdraw hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of investments from the US in a dispute over the 9/11 attacks are “ridiculous”, its foreign minister said on Monday. But Adel al-Jubeir did warn that the proposed law, which could hold the kingdom responsible for any role in the terrorist atrocity, would erode global investor confidence in the US. A bipartisan Senate bill would remove immunity from foreign governments and allow victims of the attacks in New York and Washington to sue the Saudi government if it is found to have been involved. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers that day were Saudi citizens but the government has long denied any role. Last month, the New York Times reported that Saudi Arabia had threatened to sell up to $750bn worth of American assets should the bill become law. But speaking to reporters in Geneva on Monday after talks with the US secretary of state, John Kerry, Jubeir was quoted as saying: “We say a law like this would cause an erosion of investor confidence. But then to kind of say, ‘My God, the Saudis are threatening us’ – ridiculous. “We don’t use monetary policy and we don’t use energy policy and we don’t use economic policy for political purposes. When we invest, we invest as investors. When we sell oil, we sell oil as traders,” he said, as Reuters reported. Pressed on whether Saudi Arabia had suggested that the law could affect its investment policies, the foreign minister said: “I say you can warn. What has happened is that people are saying we threatened. We said that a law like this is going to cause investor confidence to shrink. And so not just for Saudi Arabia, but for everybody.” Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and her Democratic election rival, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, have both said they back the measure, but Barack Obama has publicly opposed it. The White House has reportedly lobbied Congress to block passage of the bill, which passed the Senate judiciary committee earlier this year. Jubeir was quoted as adding: “In fact, what they are doing is stripping the principle of sovereign immunities, which would turn the world for international law into the law of the jungle. “That’s why the administration is opposed to it, and that’s why every country in the world is opposed to it. And then people say: ‘Saudi Arabia is threatening the US by pulling our investments.’ Nonsense.” Another potential rift in the relationship is a continuing effort to declassify a 28-page section of a 2004 US government report on the 9/11 attacks that is believed to detail possible Saudi connections. But on Sunday, John Brennan, the director of the CIA, defended the decision to keep this section under wraps. “It was a preliminary review that put information in there that was not corroborated, not vetted and not deemed to be accurate,” he told NBC’s Meet the Press. “This chapter was kept out because of concerns about sensitive source of methods, investigative actions.” He warned: “I think some people may seize upon that uncorroborated, unvetted information that was in there that was basically just a collation of this information that came out of FBI files, and to point to Saudi involvement, which I think would be very, very inaccurate.” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said on Monday that Obama had been briefed on the contents of the pages but not read them. “The president obviously reads a lot of material on a day to day basis,” he said. “I’m not sure that he felt that it was necessary for him to read those 28 pages.”",REAL
Pierre Karl Péladeau steps down as leader of Quebec separatist party,"Less than a year after his election as leader reignited the hopes of separatists in Quebec, media tycoon Pierre Karl Péladeau has stepped down as the head of the Parti Québécois. Péladeau said he had been forced to decide between his work and his family. “I am forced to make a choice, an agonizing choice, between my family and my political project, our political project, which is shared by so many people,” he told reporters in Montreal on Monday as he fought back tears. “I have chosen my family.” Earlier this year, Péladeau, 54, split from his wife, television producer Julie Snyder. On Sunday, Snyder told a television talkshow program that the couple – who have three children among them – are in mediation. Péladeau said the party would soon begin the search for an interim leader. “I’m making this decision for the good of my children,” he added. “I have to remain an example for them. I profoundly love the Parti Québécois, its activists and its (National Assembly) members.” The former CEO of Quebecor, Canada’s second biggest media group, Péladeau burst onto the Canadian political scene in 2014, vowing to “make Quebec a country”. He was elected as the PQ leader last May and since struggled to woo voters from the province’s governing Liberal party. Heir to a media empire founded by his father, Péladeau’s election as leader earned him comparisons with Italian media magnate-turned-politician Silvio Berlusconi and injected a star quality into Quebec’s separatist movement, amid concerns over dwindling membership numbers. In 1980, the party had 300,000 members; last year the figure had slipped to around 70,000. Recent polls suggest that most Quebeckers oppose sovereignty. Many within the party’s left, however, found it hard to reconcile Péladeau’s call for an independent Quebec with his abysmal record on labour rights. His time at the helm of Quebecor was marked by conflict with labour unions, including 16 lockouts during strikes at Quebecor companies. Others questioned how Péladeau would manage the glaring conflict of interest between his political power and Quebecor, which ranks as the main private media owner in Quebec. Péladeau’s solution was to put his shares in a trust. On Monday, Péladeau promised to remain active within the party. “I am convinced that the future of Quebec and Quebecers lies in the independence of our nation,” he said.",REAL
"Incidents of toddlers shooting others or themselves increasing, data shows","In the past two weeks, at least seven toddlers in the US have shot themselves or someone else. It’s a trend that is accelerating. The latest shooting happened Friday, at Weaver distribution center in Augusta, Georgia. A three-year-old girl waited in a car in the parking lot with her mother and older brother while a family friend went inside to buy car parts. He left his loaded gun in the car. The girl picked up the gun and pulled the trigger, sending the bullet through her bottom and into the black Honda’s windshield. Joe Leonguerrero works at Weaver. “While working, I heard a firearm discharge,” he told local television station WRDW. “I was previously in the military, so I’m familiar with the sound. And me and a co-worker went to see what was going on, and we saw a female get out of a vehicle and a child who was crying.” She was taken to a hospital and is expected to survive. The consequences have been more dire for the half-dozen other toddlers – children aged three and under – who found guns and shot someone in the past two weeks: 20 April: A two-year-old boy in Indiana died after shooting himself in the chest. His mother had left the gun in her purse on the kitchen counter. 21 April: In Missouri, a two-year-old girl died after shooting herself with her father’s gun. Police have charged her 24-year-old father with first-degree endangering the welfare of a child, among other charges. 22 April: In Louisiana, a three-year-old fatally shot himself in the head. Natchitoches police detective John Greely told the Guardian the boy’s mother and a companion were in bed, while the boy sat at the end of the bed watching television. He somehow found a pistol and shot himself; police arrested the companion, 22-year-old Alverious Demars, and have charged him with negligent homicide and obstruction of justice. 26 April: In Georgia, a three-year-old boy died after finding a gun at home and shooting himself in the chest. No charges have been filed. 27 April: In Wisconsin, a two-year-old boy shot and killed his mother. She was driving down the highway when the gun slid from under the driver’s seat. In the back seat, the toddler, who was not in a child-restraint seat, picked up the gun and fired it through the front seat. Later on 27 April: In Michigan, a three-year-old boy found a gun in his father’s drawer and shot himself in the arm. He is expected to survive. Gladwin County’s prosecutor is reviewing possible charges. The pace of such shootings is increasing. Last year, the Washington Post analyzed shootings by small children and found that by this time of year there had been 18. So far this year, there have been 23. The statistics are worse for children who are not the shooters, but who are the victims of shootings accidental or otherwise. Among children in general, aged 11 or under, the figures are startling: at least 170 have been killed or injured this year in the US. Beyond the raw statistics, it’s difficult to sort out why the numbers are climbing, because the data is not being authoritatively compiled. The US Centers for Disease Control once recorded information about the circumstances around such shootings, but has since stopped under funding pressure from Congress. Last month, more than 100 medical groups sent a letter asking Congress to resume funding the CDC’s research on gun violence. The letter said research could lead to saved lives, as it has with sudden infant death syndrome and rear-facing infant car seats. Lack of funding, the scientists wrote, has “caused a dramatic chilling effect on federal research that has stalled and stymied progress on gathering critical data to inform prevention of gun violence”.",REAL
White House ducks questions on Larry Wilmore's use of N-word to greet Obama,"The White House has faced tough questioning over comedian Larry Wilmore’s use of a taboo racial slur at its annual correspondents dinner. Press secretary Josh Earnest was challenged repeatedly by April Ryan, an African American journalist and author of The Presidency in Black and White, who suggested that many people in the room were “appalled” by the N-word being uttered to the president’s face. Earnest said that Barack Obama appreciated “the spirit” of Wilmore’s remark. Wilmore, who is African American, ended his after-dinner speech on Saturday by recognising the historical significance of America’s first black president, pounding his chest and telling Obama: “Words alone do me no justice. So, Mr President, if I’m going to keep it 100: yo, Barry, you did it, my nigga.” The comment immediately divided people both in the room and beyond. Jonathan Capehart of the Washington Post blogged: “Never before has the n-word been used to address the president. At least, not in public and most definitely not to his face. That’s why Wilmore’s use of it was as shocking as it was disrespectful.” At Monday’s daily press briefing at the White House, the issue was raised by Ryan, Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks. She described it as “a word that is one of the worst words, many people say, you could say to anyone”. Earnest did not address this directly but noted that following Obama’s act at the annual dinner is “one of the most difficult tasks in comedy”, since the president has shown himself “adept” at delivering one-liners and so expects comedians to go “right up to the line”. But Ryan pressed further: “Many African Americans in that room – who included civil rights leaders, black comedians – were very appalled. ... Black Republicans were upset, black Democrats were upset. People felt that not just throwing it at him, he threw it at them, and also, it diminished the office of the presidency and it diminished him. Did he cross the line?” Earnest responded: “April, what I would say is it’s not the first time that people on the Monday after the White House correspondents dinner have observed that the comedian on Saturday night crossed the line.” He cited the examples of Stephen Colbert, who in 2006 memorably roasted George W Bush, and Wanda Sykes, who in 2009 joked about the 11 September terrorist attacks. “So it’s not the first time that we’ve had a conversation like this in which these of kinds of concerns have been raised or expressed. “Look, I had an opportunity to speak to the president about this briefly this morning and he said that he appreciated the spirit of the sentiments that Mr Wilmore expressed.” Reflecting on Wilmore’s routine, which also targeted some journalists and left them stony-faced, Earnest added: “He ended his speech by saying that he couldn’t put into words the pride that he felt in this president and he made the observation that our country has made remarkable progress just in his lifetime from not being willing to accept an African American quarterback to electing and re-electing an African American not just to lead the United States but to lead the free world. “Again, I take Mr Wilmore at his words that he found that to be a powerful transformation just in his lifetime and something that he seemed to be pretty obviously proud of.” But Ryan wondered if Wilmore’s use of “free speech” gave the president’s detractors fodder to use it against him. Earnest said he had no idea and would not spend much time worrying about it. Ryan then made reference to a podcast interview that Obama gave last June in which he himself used the slur to argue that, despite great progress, racism is still pervasive in America. The president said at the time: “It’s not just a matter of it not being polite to say ‘nigger’ in public. That’s not the measure of whether racism still exists or not.” Wilmore, by contrast, used it for the president “somewhat as the butt of a joke”, Ryan contended. “You were in that room as well as I was,” she told Earnest. “There was an eerie, awkward silence and quietness. People didn’t know how to handle that.” The press secretary countered: “I’m confident that Mr Wilmore used the word by design – he was seeking to be provocative – but I think any reading of his comments makes clear he was not using the president as the butt of a joke. “What is true is that this is a tough assignment that any comedian takes on when they sign up for this job and the president’s expectation when he walks in that room is that that comedian and other people are going to get much closer to the line than they ordinarily would as they try to make a joke.” Ryan noted other problematic terms that littered Wilmore’s routine. “I just want to be very clear,” she said. “So the president is OK with his use and how he used the N-word, ‘jigaboo’, ‘negro nation’ and ‘thug’?” Earnest’s response referred back to the president saying he appreciated “the spirit” of Wilmore’s expressions on Saturday night. Later, he said the White House did not see or vet Wilmore’s remarks before they were delivered but he felt they came from “a genuine place”.",REAL
Israeli military orders detention of Palestinian journalist Omar Nazzal,"Israel’s military has ordered a Palestinian journalist to be held for four months without charges or trial. The military said Omar Nazzal is being held in administrative detention on suspicion of “unlawful activity” for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a PLO faction that has been labelled a terrorist organisation by Israel. His lawyer, Mahmoud Hassan, said he believes his client, a leading member of the Palestinian journalists’ union, is being targeted because of his political activism. Hassan noted that under the system of administrative detention, the defence is not shown any alleged evidence against them. Nazzal, 53, has been in custody since he was seized at an Israeli-run crossing between the West Bank and Jordan last month, while traveling to a meeting of the European Federation of Journalists. The journalist headed Palestine Today, a TV station affiliated with the militant group Islamic Jihad, for five months, but quit earlier this year shortly before Israel shut the broadcaster down. He also had ties to the PFLP which in the past was involved in attacks on Israelis. Hassan denied his client was linked to violence, adding: “This arrest is a political arrest.” Monday’s court announcement comes on the eve of World Press Freedom Day, the lead-up to which Palestinians have been using to condemn Israel. Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian political leader, on Monday urged immediate intervention to ensure Israel was “accountable for the blatant and planned escalation against Palestinian media”. The journalists’ union says that Israel is also holding in detention another 19 Palestinian journalists and students of journalism, one of them for more than 20 years. The number of Palestinians in administrative detention reached 627 at the end of February, according to official prison service figures regularly published by the Israeli rights group B’Tselem. Critics say Israel’s large-scale use of the practice amounts to a violation of rules of due process. The number of administrative detainees has doubled since the start of the latest round of Israeli-Palestinian violence in September. Since the autumn, attacks by Palestinians have claimed the lives of 28 Israelis and two Americans, while about 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli security forces.",REAL
Berta Cáceres murder: four men arrested over Honduran activist's death,"Four men have been arrested in connection with the murder of the Honduran indigenous activist Berta Cáceres, who was shot dead at her home two months ago. Two of those arrested are linked to the company building a hydroelectric dam which Cáceres had campaigned against. Sergio Ramón Rodriguez, an engineer for the Agua Zarca dam being built by Desarrollos Energéticos SA (Desa), and Douglas Geovanny Bustillo, a retired military officer and the former head of Desa’s security detail, were both detained on Monday morning, according to the Honduran public prosecutor’s office. The four men were due to appear before a judge later on Monday, where prosecutors will outline their alleged links to the crime. Cáceres, who last year won the Goldman environmental prize for her work opposing the Agua Zarca dam on the Gualcarque River, had previously reported both men to authorities for making threats against her life. Rodriguez had allegedly threatened Cáceres just days before her death as she led a protest by her group the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (Copinh) to the river which is considered sacred by the indigenous Lenca people. Cáceres reported the incident to the authorities, and accused Desa of using local thugs to intimidate her. The arrests were made after police carried out 10 simultaneous early morning raids in the capital, Tegucigalpa, and the coastal cities La Ceiba and Trujillo. The other two detainees are Mariano Díaz Chávez and Edison Atilio Duarte Meza. Duarte Meza is a former military officer; Mariano Díaz Chávez is a member of the country’s armed forces on active duty. The arrests come amid mounting pressure on the Honduran government to authorize an independent international investigation into the activist’s murder, which has triggered widespread condemnation. Cáceres, who had reported 33 death threats linked to her campaign against the dam, was killed after two assailants broke into her house just before midnight on 2 March. The four detainees face charges linked to her murder and the attempted murder of her friend Gustavo Castro, director of Friends of the Earth Mexico, who was injured in the attack. The investigation thus far has been condemned by Cáceres’ family, colleagues and independent observers. The first suspects were members of Copinh and Castro who were interviewed for several days. It took investigators 11 days to visit the offices of Desa. The family, who have also criticized the authorities for failing to communicate with them while leaking important information to the press, found out about the arrests on the news. Laura Cáceres, 23, the activist’s youngest daughter, told the Guardian: “The Honduran state is too closely linked to the murder of my mother to carry out an independent investigation. It is the government who awarded the dam commission and the government who sent military and police to work with Desa’s private security guards, who threatened my mother.” “If it wasn’t for our struggle and the international pressure for justice, my mother’s murder would already be extinct. We have woken up to this news but it doesn’t change our demands for an international investigation,” she said, speaking by telephone from the town of La Esperanza, where her mother was murdered. The government has so far rejected an offer by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to send a team of experts to Honduras to investigate into the murder of Cáceres and other high-profile activists. Honduras is the world’s most dangerous country for environmental rights defenders, with 109 murdered between 2010 and 2015, according to the NGO Global Witness. This article was amended on 3 May 2016. An earlier version described Gustavo Castro as a coordinator of Greenpeace Mexico; he is director of Friends of the Earth Mexico.",REAL
Largest US food producers ask Congress to shield lobbying activities,"Some of the largest food producers in the US have successfully petitioned Congress to propose a change to the Freedom of Information Act that would shield their communications with boards overseen by the US Department of Agriculture from the scrutiny of the public, the Guardian has learned. The move follows a series of stories that showed the government-backed egg promoter, the American Egg Board, had attempted to stifle competition from Silicon Valley food startup Hampton Creek, in direct conflict with its mandate. Several agricultural lobbyists including United Egg Producers, the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and the National Pork Producers Council have now sent a letter to the congressional subcommittee overseeing appropriations for the Department of Agriculture (USDA) asking to be exempted from Foia requests to their own respective promotional boards. The letter to the subcommittee reads, in part: We support inclusion of language in the Committee report urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to recognize that the research and promotion programs are funded solely with producer dollars, and therefore are not agencies of the Federal government or subject to the Freedom of Information Act (Foia). The language added to the bill reads thusly: The Committee notes that the commodity Research and Promotion boards that the agency oversees are not agencies of the federal government, nor are Research and Promotion programs funded with federal funds. The funding used to operate and carry out the activities of the various Research and Promotion programs is provided by producers and industry stakeholders, and employees of the boards are not federal employees. Therefore, the Committee urges USDA to recognize that such boards are not subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. Section 552. The bill has not yet been passed. The government-backed food marketing groups are called “checkoff”programs, dedicated to promoting individual commodities and backed by a levy on farmers. Their most recognizable presence is in the form of marketing slogans such as “The incredible, edible egg” or “Beef. It’s what’s for dinner”. The administrators of checkoff programs are appointed by the USDA and the programs themselves are funded by a levy on goods sold. The supreme court has ruled that contributing to the programs is mandatory, and that the programs themselves constitute government speech. That decision was controversial – small producers have long argued that checkoffs exclusively serve the interests of the their largest competitors, and environmental and animal rights activists say checkoffs often obscure the cruelties of industrial farming. Last year the Guardian learned through a Freedom of Information Act request by attorney Jeffrey Light and Foia expert Ryan Shapiro that the USDA-backed American Egg Board (the egg industry checkoff) had advised Unilever on an ongoing lawsuit against Hampton Creek, a company that produces plant-based mayonnaise, and had agreed to attempt to use its influence to have Hampton Creek’s Just Mayo removed from Whole Foods. Shapiro said the attempt to cast a shroud over shady dealings among checkoff groups came far too late. “Now that some of their blatantly improper dealings have been exposed via Foia, instead of cleaning up their acts, these boards are attempting to exempt themselves from Foia altogether,” Shapiro told the Guardian. “But as the already released documents demonstrate, these boards are sorely in need of greater transparency and must not be allowed to shroud their already opaque dealings with even more secrecy.” The Foia expert also observed that no less a pro-business titan than the late Antonin Scalia would have disagreed with the producers’ assessment of their own accountability. In a ruling slapping down a challenge to the checkoff programs’ authority by a group of small farmers, Scalia wrote of the beef checkoff: “The program is authorized and the basic message prescribed by federal statute, and specific requirements for the promotions’ content are imposed by federal regulations promulgated after notice and comment. The Secretary of Agriculture, a politically accountable official, oversees the program, appoints and dismisses the key personnel, and retains absolute veto power over the advertisements’ content, right down to the wording.” The proposed rule comes at an awkward time for its supporters: the US federal government is in the midst of a review across its entire breadth after a call for greater Foia responsiveness and accessibility. As recently as last week, a letter to US comptroller general Gene L Dodaro, signed by the leadership of both the house and senate judiciary committees, asked the Government Accountability Office to audit agencies for compliance. Josh Tetrick, CEO of Hampton Creek, said the proposed Foia exemption was an example of how far the food industry remains removed from everyday Americans. “You don’t just wake up one morning with a food system that doesn’t reflect our values,” Tetrick said. “It happens over decades.” Indeed, displeasure with the move appears to cross party lines. “This is crony capitalism organized by Washington at its worst,” said Republican senator Mike Lee in an emailed statement. “Not only is the federal government forcing market participants to collude, it is then actively engaging in a cover up of that collusion.” This article has been updated to clarify the nature of checkoff programs",REAL
Indiana primary: what's at stake for the remaining presidential candidates,"Tuesday’s Indiana primary will be one of the last chances for underdog candidates Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders to upset the frontrunners and try to force a contested convention in the Republican and Democratic races for president. Among Republicans, Cruz has gone all out in Indiana in recent weeks, virtually living in the Hoosier State as he tries to upset Donald Trump. The senator from Texas has even taken the unprecedented step of announcing a vice-presidential candidate months away from the convention, picking former rival Carly Fiorina in an attempt to recapture momentum. With the arcane system that Republicans use to determine their nominee, Indiana is vitally important. If Trump wins the 30 delegates that Indiana awards to the winner of the state’s popular vote – the winner of each of the state’s nine congressional districts receives three delegates apiece – only a massive upset by Cruz in California could stop Trump from the 1,237 delegates he needs to win on the convention’s first ballot. Recent public polls show Trump with a solid lead over Cruz in the state, and one released by NBC and the Wall Street Journal on Sunday shows the frontrunner with a 15-point lead. “If we win in Indiana, it’s all over,” Trump promised a crowd on Sunday in Terra Haute, Indiana. “And then we can focus on ‘Crooked Hillary’, please.” Cruz has campaigned doggedly through the state, nonetheless. In a retail stop in Carmel, an Indianapolis suburb, on Monday, his allies besieged a local coffee shop. Fiorina was joined by Cruz’s wife, Heidi, as well as Utah senator Mike Lee and Texas congressman Louie Gohmert, who all glad-handed every Indianan they could find in the room. With the Texas senator’s position looking increasingly beleaguered, his wife and Fiorina could be overheard taking jibes at the press as they thanked voters for their prayers on Cruz’s behalf. Gohmert, a longtime supporter, expressed his wonderment that “the most dishonest man in the race calls the most honest man ‘Lyin’”. In the meantime, Trump dismissed both Cruz and Ohio governor John Kasich, a third candidate, as “the leftovers”, and waxed confident that he would be the nominee. The frontrunner also added a new wrinkle to fiery protectionist rhetoric on Sunday, telling a crowd in Fort Wayne: “We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country.” On the Democratic side, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is hoping for an upset in a state where former secretary of state Hillary Clinton holds a narrow lead. “We always thought Indiana was a state that would absolutely be willing to listen to this message,” Pete D’Alessandro, a top Sanders operative who is overseeing his efforts in Indiana, told the Guardian, “because Nafta and these terrible trade agreements have just devastated the state over the past generation.” Crediting a long active volunteer effort, he expressed confidence that Sanders will do well. However, Sanders’ fundraising has lagged compared to past months: he raised only $26m in April, which was $20m less than his March total. He needs a big win to keep his hopes alive in the late stages of the primary, following big wins for Clinton in New York and other east coast states. Although a win in Indiana for Sanders would likely only make a minimal difference in narrowing Clinton’s massive lead in delegates (without counting the so-called “superdelegates”, she currently leads Sanders by 327 pledged delegates, more than twice the final gap between her and Obama in 2008), it would give him much-needed momentum as the arithmetic increasingly makes Clinton the prohibitive favorite to be the Democratic nominee.",REAL
A Palestinian view on the antisemitism row,"Jonathan Freedland (My plea to the left, 30 April) asks us to imagine if a country far away was created for black people and asks if the left would treat it as it does Israel. As a Palestinian I want to tell him that if, instead of a country for Jews, a country for black people or any other group had been created in our homeland without our consent, we would have objected and resisted as Palestinians with the same vigour. If it continued to defy international law and occupy, colonise and murder and make our lives so miserable that we would leave, we would call for its boycott as we do in the case of the real occupier, Israel. And if that occupation had continued for as long as Israel’s has, we would have called supporters of human rights to help us end this occupation, treat Palestinian citizens of that state equally and allow Palestinian refugees to return. As it happens, those are the legitimate demands of the BDS movement called by Palestinian civil society organisations in 2005. Further, had Israel been created in, say, Uganda and not in Palestine, does Freedland or any other supporter of Israel think that Palestinians would have created Fatah or Hamas and sent them to Uganda to attack the Jewish citizens of this entity in Uganda? Even closer to home, Balfour had more right to promise Wales to the Zionists than Palestine – with my apologies to the Welsh people. Had he done so and had Israel been created in Wales, had Cardiff been occupied and declared the united capital of Israel, and had Swansea been under siege for 10 years because it reacted to Israel’s illegal occupation, would the Welsh have simply accepted this and behaved as a model occupied people? I remind all who are interested in peace in historic Palestine that we Palestinians did not choose our occupiers. They chose Palestine knowing it was not an empty land but one that had a people, my people, the Palestinians that have paid with their land, lives and rights. As we approach the 68th anniversary of our catastrophe or Nakba, our occupiers need to acknowledge the wrong they did to us, apologise and pursue a genuine reconciliation, which may necessitate a very different political arrangement in historic Palestine. Instead they are busy conflating antisemitism with anti-Zionism, thinking this will end the call for Israel to come to its senses. Supporters of Israel who do this are really working to protect its illegal policies and to delay the day when it finally operates within rather than above the law.

Home help for the shortage of chefs,"Tim Evans makes a brilliant point about there being “highly qualified chefs in the UK already in the women who cook for their families every day... Why are they not encouraged to move into the workplace?” (Letter, 28 April). But in my view this doesn’t just extend to Asian restaurants (Report, 22 April). I’ve been thinking about this point with regards to the shortage of chefs in the restaurant industry as a whole – since it was highlighted to me by Sat Bains, a near neighbour, who recently went up to working a four-day week in order to deal with a shortage of talented and hardworking chefs locally. If restaurateurs were able to be more flexible and more open-minded they would find an incredible pool of talent among the women who cook for their families and friends on a daily basis in UK society in general. I’m sure there are many women (myself included) who would be delighted to transfer their skills, and gain much needed confidence, by entering the workplace once again to work for top-class restaurants.

Feast of cat shown on eagle cam scares feline owners: 'Nature isn't pretty',"Cat owners have been warned of the dangers their feline companions face when venturing outdoors after video emerged of bald eagles feasting on the body of a dead cat near Pittsburgh. Footage from a live web camera mounted at the Hays bald eagle nest, located a few miles from the center of Pittsburgh, showed the eagles serving up the cat to hungry eaglets. Concerned cat owners bombarded the local Audubon Society about why the eagles had preyed upon the cat. “After reviewing the footage, we believe that the cat was dead when brought to the nest,” the Audubon Society of western Pennsylvania in a statement. “While many may cringe at this, the eagles bring squirrels, rabbits, fish (and other animals) into the nest to eat multiple times each day.” “To people, the cat represents a pet but to the eagles and to other raptors, the cat is a way to sustain the eaglets and help them to grow. While seeing a cat in the nest was difficult for many, we’re hopeful that people will understand that this is a part of nature, and nature isn’t always kind or pretty.” Eagles aren’t the only threat facing cats. Coyotes are considered one of the most common predators of felines. Coyotes have expanded their range in parts of the US, causing occasional clashes with cats and dogs. In 2009, residents of a Denver suburb decided to scare off problem coyotes using paintball guns. Other threats to cats include snakes, raccoons and porcupines. Katie Lisnik, director of cat protection and policy at the Humane Society, said eagles and owls are the biggest threats to cats. “I live in New England and the fisher [a small carnivorous mammal] can take a cat too,” she told the Guardian. “When cats are outside, they are part of the natural world. The animals that prey upon them don’t think ‘that’s a pet, it’s different’.” Lisnik said a number of approaches can be taken, such as leashing cats when they taken outside, or keeping them indoors, as Americans have increasingly chosen to do. But it’s worth noting that cats are more often predators than prey. The Audubon Society has urged people to keep cats indoors because the felines kill and eat “many, many songbirds”. Cats kill an estimated 1.3 billion to four billion birds and an incredible 6.3 billion to 22.3 billion mammals, such as rodents, each year in the US. While the majority of these deaths are caused be free-ranging “feral” cats, rather than pets, separate studies suggest that around a third of all domesticated cats engage in hunting. In Australia, where huge numbers of native animals are threatened by feral cats, several jurisdictions have considered making owners place bells around cats’ necks, in order to warn unsuspecting birds. The Australian government has authorized a mass cull of feral cats, to the dismay of celebrities including French actor Brigitte Bardot and British singer Morrissey, but no such intervention is planned in the US. The Humane Society said that more needs to be done to reduce the number of feral cats, although primarily through trapping and neutering untamed felines. “There should be an overall goal of fewer unowned cats,” Lisnik said. “Cats being harmed isn’t a good thing and nor is killing large numbers of birds and other wildlife.”",REAL
Teacher 'sickout' over summer pay closes nearly every school in Detroit,"Nearly every school in Detroit closed on Monday after the teacher’s union called on members to take a sick day because the district will not be able to pay teachers in the summer unless a funding crisis is resolved. More than 45,600 students missed school on Monday after teachers responded to the union’s call, forcing the closure of 94 of the 97 schools in the district. A few hundred teachers picketed outside the district headquarters. The Detroit school district, which is estimated to have more than $3bn in debt, said on Saturday it could not pay teachers past 30 June. So without additional funding, teachers who had chosen to be paid throughout the year, instead of just when school is in session, would not receive money they had already earned. Detroit Federation of Teachers interim president Ivy Bailey said the union organized the sickout because the district had broken its deal to pay teachers. “Teachers want to be in the classroom giving children a chance to learn and reach their potential,” Bailey said in a statement. “Unfortunately, by refusing to guarantee that we will be paid for our work, DPS [Detroit public schools] is effectively locking our members out of the classrooms.” Bailey did not say whether the sickouts would continue past Monday, though the union has an emergency meeting planned for Tuesday night. The union’s executive vice-president, Terrence Martin, told the Detroit Free Press that it would hold a voice vote at the meeting “to authorize a major collective action”, in addition to holding ballot votes in schools later that week. Under Michigan law, government employees like teachers are not allowed to strike. The state attorney general, however, chose not to take action against union members following a similar sickout in January over poor school conditions, which labor experts said could be considered a method of strike. Though most school districts in the US are run by local governments, Detroit’s financial difficulties led the state to take control of the district in 2009. Since then, a rotating cast of emergency managers have been tasked to head the district’s recovery. Former bankruptcy judge Steven Rhodes, who took over the position in March, said he understood the teacher’s frustrations but thought the union’s decision was “counterproductive and detrimental”. “I am, however, confident that the legislature will support the request that will guarantee that teachers will receive the pay that is owed to them,” Rhodes said in a statement. “The DFT’s choice for a drastic call to action was not necessary.” The state legislature is considering a $720m restructuring plan to pay off the school’s debts. The state senate approved the deal in March, but it’s waiting for approval from the state house and the governor, Rick Snyder. In March, Snyder approved a bill to use $48.7m to keep the school district operating until 30 June. In response to Monday’s sickout, Snyder said: “That’s not a constructive act with respect to getting legislation through.” Detroit mayor Mike Duggan had not commented on this sickout as of Monday afternoon, though after January’s union action, he said there was “no question about the legitimacy of the issues they’re raising”, after touring schools where he saw a dead mouse and children wearing coats to stay warm in class.",REAL
Labour suspends three councillors over alleged antisemitic remarks,"Jeremy Corbyn will seek to seize back the initiative on Tuesday in Labour’s battle to hold on to key council seats at Thursday’s local elections, after the party was forced to suspend three councillors in a continuing row about antisemitism. On Friday Corbyn announced an independent review of claims of antisemitism within the Labour party, in the hope of drawing a line under accusations from some MPs that he had failed to respond forcefully enough to the issue. Three councillors were suspended on Monday after evidence emerged that they had used social media to promote what appeared to be antisemitic views. The former mayor of Blackburn, Salim Mulla, who is now a councillor, had shared social media posts last August that appeared to draw a link between Zionism and Islamic State. Below photographs with slogans suggesting that support for Palestinians from France and Japan had triggered attacks by Isis, he said: “Is this a coincidence. You [sic] bloody daam [sic] right it is. We all know Zionism game being played. It’s bloody obvious who is manupulating[sic] this. Those who are not sure. ISRAEL.” Separately, Nottingham city councillor Ilyas Aziz was found to have shared a post suggesting that Israel should be relocated to the US – the same one that resulted in the Bradford West MP, Naz Shah, being suspended last week despite making a series of public apologies. Aziz also posted a link to an article about Nazi Germany, alongside which he said: “A reminder of the treatment and suffering of Jews in Nazi Germany. Are there any similarities to how Israel is treating Palestinians?” Later on Monday a third man, Burnley councillor Shah Hussain, was suspended, after it emerged that he had told an Israeli footballer on Twitter in 2014, “you and your country” are “doing exactly the same thing” that Hitler did, in reference to the violence against Palestinians. A Labour spokesperson confirmed that all three had been suspended pending an investigation. It emerged on Monday night that an unknown number of other Labour members have also been suspended while the party’s compliance committee investigates accusations of antisemitism against them. A party source admitted there were more cases under review that had not yet been made public, but said reports that the figure was as high as 50 were “a wild overestimate”. The source said: “While we do not give a running commentary on numbers suspended, the majority of the Labour party’s suspensions for antisemitism are in the public domain. Labour takes antisemitism very seriously and that’s why Jeremy has set out a robust plan to tackle the issue.” With the latest polls suggesting Labour is heading for its worst performance in local elections since 1982, and could lose up to 175 council seats, Corbyn’s team are keen to turn attention away from the issue of antisemitism and focus on campaigning. Labour launched a minimalist new poster Monday night, with the slogan: “Elections are about taking sides: Labour is on yours.” A former director of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, was drafted in to chair a review of the Labour party after a series of incidents that culminated in an embarrassing public spat between Ken Livingstone, former London mayor, and John Mann MP. Livingstone defended Shah in radio and TV interviews but in doing so drew links between Zionism and Hitler. He has insisted that he will contest the grounds for his suspension when his case is reviewed by Labour’s national executive committee. The dispute was given fresh impetus over the weekend when Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the Unite union, claimed that the row over Corbyn’s response to antisemitic incidents was the latest crisis manufactured by “treacherous” Labour MPs keen to undermine the leader. Corbyn’s team insists there has been no surge in antisemitic incidents since he became party leader last year; but centrist MPs are warning that some Labour leftwingers slide too easily from staunch support for the Palestinians, to making slurs against Israel. Asked whether Labour has a problem with antisemitism, Corbyn told the Mirror: “No, there is not a huge problem. What there is is a very small number of people that have said things that they should not have done. We have therefore said they will be suspended and investigated.” However, the shadow education secretary Lucy Powell said on Monday that there was “clearly” an issue with antisemitism “otherwise we would not have spent the last six or seven days talking about it”. Asked on Channel 4 news if Livingstone should be expelled from the party, she said: “It’s very, very difficult to see a circumstance where his suspension would be lifted and he would be readmitted.” One backbench MP critical of Corbyn said local councillors in his constituency have been “head in hands” over the party’s travails nationally, which they fear could lose them their seats on Thursday. However, even those Labour MPs most sceptical of the leadership say they do not expect any challenger to move against him until after June’s EU referendum – and they are conscious that he retains overwhelming support among grassroots members. Meanwhile Corbyn’s closest lieutenant – the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell – has publicly denied claims that he is readying himself to take over if Corbyn is unseated in a putsch, tweeting: “Media &amp; right wing dirty tricks &amp; lies trying to divide me and Jeremy. They should know it only unites us even more &amp; makes us stronger.”",REAL
New Hampshire halts controversial vote meant to limit Trump's delegate support,"An attempt by the New Hampshire Republican party to limit Donald Trump’s influence in a potential contested convention was halted Monday, when the state chair canceled a controversial online vote for positions on crucial committees just minutes after the voting deadline. In an email obtained by the Guardian, party chair Jennifer Horn said that although all 23 of the state’s delegates to the Republican National Convention participated in the vote, she was canceling it “in the interest of full transparency”. Instead, she summoned a delegates-only meeting in Concord on Friday, in which those unable to attend could participate via conference call. Initially, in an email sent out Saturday night, the state party’s executive director proposed a slate for the eight slots on convention committees reserved for New Hampshire delegates at the Republican gathering in Cleveland in July. The proposed slate included two supporters apiece of John Kasich, Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz and one supporter of Marco Rubio. The eighth slot was left vacant. Trump won overwhelmingly in the Granite State’s February primary, with 35% of the vote. His nearest competitor, John Kasich, only received 15% in what was then the first primary in the country. Under New Hampshire’s relatively proportional rules, by which any candidate who gets more than 10% of the vote receives delegates, Trump was awarded 11 of the state’s 23 delegates. Since then, the well-organized Cruz campaign has picked up stray delegates in other states that Trump won, such as Louisiana, and swept local contests in Wyoming and Colorado. In contrast, Trump’s campaign spent weeks in disarray, its manager charged with battery against a reporter and ballot errors common at the local level. The businessman brought on a veteran of backroom politics, Paul Manafort, to take over his campaign’s efforts to secure the 1,237 delegates needed for the nomination. His campaign has struggled in states where the process of delegate selection is not determined by the results of the primary election, but in New Hampshire delegates are chosen directly by campaigns. However, even without changing the composition of the delegates, who sits on convention committees can still have a major effect on who wins the nomination. The rules committee, in particular, is very important to the campaigns this year. Many delegates are bound to Trump on the first ballot by party rules, which oblige them to vote according to the results of their state’s primary. But on the second, third and subsequent ballots, more and more delegates are free to vote their conscience. In theory, a rules committee made up of party members hostile to Trump could change this rule – and put the nomination up for grabs. Jennifer Horn, the chair of the New Hampshire GOP, has long been a critic of Trump. She condemned Trump as “un-American” after his call for a ban on Muslims entering the US in December. She did not respond to requests for comment on Monday but told the Guardian on Saturday that the committee election process was “not something I am going to discuss with the press until it’s totally closed”. A well connected Trump ally in New Hampshire used the episode to call the state GOP’s leadership into question “her ability to run a fair election”. “It’s fair to say that Jennifer Horn has been a disastrous state party chair, exceptionally critical of Donald Trump,” said the supporter, who asked for anonymity. “This [was] an attempt to circumvent the will of the voters when Donald Trump won the state by 20 points and received 11 delegates,” they said.",REAL
Disney pins its merchandise designs on an adult audience,"Its high street stores are meccas of overpriced tat with piles of cuddly Nemo fishes, plastic lightsabres and polyester princess outfits that send girls into a frenzy. With recent cartoon blockbusters such as Frozen, Disney has tightened its hold over children’s hearts but now it is targeting their parents too, by pitching a clothing and homeware empire aimed squarely at adults. “We did a lot of consumer research and discovered there was huge demand for adult product from Disney,” said Francesca Gianesin, who heads up fashion and lifestyle for the Europe, Middle East and Asia region for Disney Consumer Products. “When we see a movie, the first thing we think is will there be an emotional connection? What is it men and women would like to feel by wearing pieces of that movie?” The division is already enjoying a strong run, with sales up 13% to $4.5bn (£3bn) last year as cinema-goers snapped up Frozen, Avengers and Star Wars-related T-shirts, toys and lunch boxes. But the target audience is not the fancy dress party goer – at the clothing and homeware event Disney held at Somerset House last week there wasn’t a pair of Mickey Mouse-style suspender shorts or a Cinderella costume with battery-operated lights in sight. Gianesin is wearing a Fausto Puglisi tunic inspired by the Captain America franchise, and is channelling superhero rather than Disney princess. “It’s about empowerment because I’m a superhero,” the Italian explained. “I’m wearing Captain America and I’m a woman, and I want to be seen as strong.” More than 1,000 fashion industry professionals trooped to the event at Somerset House, a glamorous neoclassical building on the Strand in central London, which with its cobbled square and dancing fountains is often a hangout during London fashion week. In an industry always hungry for new ideas, Disney serves up a huge archive for fashion folk to plunder: from the drawings that were the genesis of classic 1930s and 1940s animations such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia and Bambi to storyboards and props from the most recent Marvel films. Enthusiasm for the event was underlined by key figures such as Sandra Choi, creative director of Jimmy Choo, and Geoffroy de La Bourdonnaye, president of Chloé, taking part in a panel debate on the “power of storytelling”. It is only the second time Disney has courted the fashion industry in this way, with last year’s show based on mock-ups created by Disney designers. This year several galleries were packed with the Disney-inspired output of high-end clothing designers ranging from Preen to Anya Hindmarch and Marc Jacobs as well as more accessible fashions such as a £145 pair of tiger-print Reebok trainers, inspired by its Jungle Book remake. Disney grants character licences for use on everything from toys to clothing and food, earning royalties on the wholesale or retail price. Its hottest properties include Frozen, Mickey and Minnie, Marvel’s The Avengers and Spider-Man – and, lest we forget, the Disney Princesses. The broad appeal of Disney is clear: its own stores sell a pair of Cinderella “light up” shoe for £16, while a bespoke pair, decorated with thousands of Swarovski crystals, can be ordered from Jimmy Choo for just under £3,000. Gianesin has reorganised her staff to create a Disney Living team, signalling an ambition to conquer the fragmented homewares market, with its characters ripe for use on everything from cushions to crockery and tea towels. Walt Disney logged the colours used to paint each character in its now classic animations, handing the company a paintbox filled with shades such as “Scat cat” purple (from The Aristocats) and “shine on ice” from Bambi. Lorna Hall, head of market intelligence at trend forecaster WGSN, said demand for “novelty and nostalgia done well” should not be underestimated. “There is a constant need for newness and storytelling in a fashion market that is quite stagnant at the moment,” she explained. “Disney is an iconic brand and part of the story of how we have grown up. There are lots of stories for brands to play with.” With a market value of $170bn, Walt Disney’s other interests include TV channels as well as the famous theme parks and film studios. Its arsenal of film rights was boosted by the purchase of Lucasfilm, the company behind Star Wars, in 2012, having swallowed Pixar, the animation firm behind Toy Story, and Marvel Comics in the 2000s. “Whether you have children or not, it’s all about the emotional connection,” added Gianesin. “Luxury brands create new trends that move through the pyramid from luxury to trend-market to mid-market to mass market, even discount. We are part of pop culture. There are so many properties and characters that are timeless and relevant to different consumers.”",REAL

"Sexual harassment training may have reverse effect, research suggests","Sexual harassment courses aimed at preventing workplace discrimination can have the opposite effect, making men less capable of perceiving inappropriate behavior and more likely to blame victims, according to academic studies that cast doubt on traditional training programs. One researcher who has questioned the effectiveness of harassment prevention classes is Lauren Edelman, a professor of law and sociology at the University of California Berkeley, the prestigious school that has been at the center of a series of high-profile faculty misconduct scandals in recent months. “Sexual harassment training may, in fact, make it less likely that males will recognize situations that are harassing,” said Edelman, a faculty member in the renowned UC Berkeley law school, where Sujit Choudhry resigned as dean after he was found to have sexually harassed his executive assistant. “Sexual harassment training may provoke backlash in males.” Studies testing the effects of harassment training are very limited, but some research has suggested counterintuitive and troubling consequences – that after men complete trainings, they may be more inclined to brush aside allegations and discount victims. Some researchers believe trainings have no positive effects, tend to be more about legal cover than meaningful prevention or may even have unintended negative consequences – raising serious concerns about the way colleges and companies heavily focus on training as a solution to harassment. One Journal of Applied Behavioral Science study that evaluated a sexual harassment program for university employees found that men who participated in the training were “significantly less likely” to consider coercive behaviors toward a subordinate or student as sexual harassment compared with a control group of men who hadn’t done the training. Men who completed the 30-minute training – during which officials discussed actions that constitute harassment, the harms of harassment, the importance of reporting and possible discipline – were also significantly less likely to report harassment. The men’s surprising responses may have been an “effort at self-preservation intended to defend and protect against a perceived attack on them”, the authors wrote. In other words, the training appears to make some men feel threatened and afraid that they will be subject to false accusations, said Shereen Bingham, co-author of the study and professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha school of communication. As a result, they may respond in a defensive manner. “We were surprised … it certainly appears to be irrational,” said Bingham. “The only explanation can be psychological or emotional.” The findings highlight a broader challenge – that men in leadership roles sometimes struggle to relate to the experiences of those who have faced harassment, she said: “People in powerful positions don’t have a good grasp of what it’s like to be in a non-dominant group.” Other studies have shown that when workplaces actively inform men of sexual harassment policies, it can also have unintended negative effects. A study published in the Social Psychology Quarterly found that after men learned about harassment rules, it triggered implicit gender biases, effectively making it more likely for them to stereotype women. “The purpose of sexual harassment policy is to make men and women more equal in the workplace,” said Justine Tinkler, assistant professor of sociology at the University of Georgia and co-author of the study. “If the policies are sort of activating gender stereotypes rather than challenging them, they may not be promoting that broader goal.” Tinkler has also studied how sexual harassment trainings can provoke backlash and how people who say they support harassment laws are resistant to the enforcement of those policies. Trainings can also reinforce men’s feelings that women are “emotional and duplicitous in the way that they both want sexual attention, but don’t want sexual harassment”, she explained. Edelman, the UC Berkeley professor, said she suspects the backlash could stem from the “cartoonish, somewhat unrealistic” harassment examples that trainings often include – lessons that can make participants skeptical and resentful. Edelman’s own research has focused on what’s known as “symbolic compliance”, which refers to the way organizations’ anti-harassment and diversity policies and procedures are primarily focused on demonstrating compliance in a legal context – and likely do little to actually reduce discrimination or harassment. What’s clear is that there’s minimal research suggesting that standard harassment trainings have a positive impact and an overall dearth of studies on the subject, Edelman said. “We really need more research on what works. All we really know about sexual harassment training is that it protects employers from liability. We don’t know whether it protects employees. We don’t know whether it reduces sexual harassment.” In California, employers with 50 or more employees are required by law to provide at least two hours of harassment prevention training, and in the University of California, all faculty and supervisors must complete a training every two years. Despite those training policies, UC Berkeley administrators and professors have repeatedly harassed subordinates and students and faced light punishments after the university substantiated allegations. That includes a famous astronomer, a tenure-track professor and the law dean, who was ordered to take a training course after he was found guilty. The questionable research makes clear that universities should not only study the effectiveness of training, but should also prioritize other mechanisms to promote prevention, professors said. “The university should focus more on having a much clearer zero-tolerance policy with very clear sanctions that are very consistently carried out,” said Edelman. Tinkler said the best way to combat workplace sexual harassment is to reduce gender inequality and promote women in leadership positions. “It really requires changing workplaces that have gender inequality structured into the way that they are organized,” she said.",REAL
Woman sues Starbucks over ice-to-coffee ratio in cold drinks,"More coffee, please! A Chicago woman is suing Starbucks for allegedly serving her too much ice and too little caffeine in its cold beverages. With summer on the horizon and iced drinks coming back into season, Starbucks is being accused of short-changing its coffee lovers. “A Starbucks customer who orders a Venti cold drink receives only 14 fluid ounces of that drink – just over half the advertised amount, and just over half the amount for which they are paying,” states the 29-page-long complaint filed by customer Stacey Pincus, the lead plaintiff in the case, filed in northern Illinois federal court on Wednesday, according to Courthouse News Service. “In the iced coffee example, a Starbucks customer who orders and pays for a Venti iced coffee, expecting to receive 24 fluid ounces of iced coffee based on Starbucks’ advertisement and marketing, will instead receive only about 14 fluid ounces of iced coffee.” Starbucks’ cold beverages come in four different sizes: tall (12oz), grande (16oz), venti (24oz) and trenta (30oz). Hot beverages are only served in the first three sizes. “In essence, Starbucks is advertising the size of its cold drink cups on its menu, rather than the amount of fluid a customer will receive when they purchase a cold drink – and deceiving its customers in the process,” states the lawsuit. Pincus’s complaint also takes issue with the company’s pricing system, which includes higher prices for cold drinks. Since hot drinks do not include ice and cost less, she argues, Starbucks is making more money off of customers buying iced drinks. Starbucks believes that the lawsuit is without merit. “Our customers understand and expect that ice is an essential component of any ‘iced’ beverage. If a customer is not satisfied with their beverage preparation, we will gladly remake it,” Jamie Riley, a spokesperson for Starbucks, told CNN. Starbucks customers who desire less ice in their beverages have also been known to ask for “light” ice when placing their orders. “You can order light ice or extra ice on any of our iced beverages,” the company tweeted last April. The lawsuit filed by Pincus is to apply to anyone who has purchased an iced beverage in the past 10 years. According to the complaint, the claims could exceed $5m.",REAL
Norwegian wealth fund to focus on executive pay at AGMs,"Boardroom bosses have been put on alert that their pay has moved beyond being a focus for UK investors after the biggest wealth fund in the world said it was scrutinising pay deals. At a time when the amount of revolts in this year’s annual general meeting season are coming thicker and faster than those in recent years, the Norway oil fund has revealed it is preparing to target high pay. Yngve Slyngstad, chief executive of the fund, told the Financial Times that the absolute level of pay – not just the way deals were structured – was becoming an issue. “We have so far looked at this in a way that has focused on pay structures rather than pay levels. We think, due to the way the issue of executive remuneration has developed, that we will have to look at what an appropriate level of executive remuneration is as well,” said Slyngstad. The Norges Bank Investment Management is so large that it holds stakes in most major companies. It supported the controversial pay deal for BP’s chief executive, Bob Dudley, which was voted against by a majority of investors but, according to the FT, the fund voted against pay at Anglo American and also at Weir. Weir has faced the largest rebellion of this AGM season and was forced to abandon potential share awards for its top management team, after 72.4% of shareholders voted against its pay policies. “We are looking at how to approach this issue in the public space. We will choose the right instance for the right case of voting,” Slyngstad said. The remarks by Slyngstad come as a long list of London-listed companies prepare to hold their AGMs over the coming days, including Reckitt Benckiser, whose chief executive was paid £23m in 2015, double the amount the year before. Two banks, Standard Chartered and bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland, along with Rolls-Royce, GlaxoSmithKline and hedge fund Man Group, are also holding meetings. Data compiled by the corporate governance consultancy ISS Corporate Solutions (ICS) shows that two pay deals have already secured “no” votes – those at BP and Smith &amp; Nephew – compared with none by this stage over the previous three years. “The average level of dissent for advisory remuneration report resolutions across the FTSE All Share continues to outpace that evidenced in recent years,” said Stephan Costa, executive director at ICS. “More critically, we are seeing companies failing to secure majority support with others narrowly passing, thereby underscoring the depth and breadth of investor sentiments on pay this annual meeting season,” Costa said. The AGM season continues for a number of more weeks yet, when major companies hold their investor meetings, including WPP, the advertising company which confirmed last week that its chief executive, Sir Martin Sorrell, had been paid £70.4m in 2015. • This article was amended on 3 May 2016 to give the full name of ISS Corporate Solutions",REAL
Tensions run high in Odessa on anniversary of deadly clashes,"A huge police and security operation has been launched to keep the calm in Odessa on Monday, the second anniversary of one of the bloodiest days in Ukraine’s recent history. Two years ago, clashes left 48 dead and hundreds injured in the Black Sea city. Most of the dead were pro-Russia protesters who died in a fire at the trade union building. Political and social tensions continue to bubble under the surface. On Monday authorities cordoned off the area around the trade union building, surrounding it with police and National Guard forces and keeping out those who had come to pay their respects. More than 1,000 people gathered outside the police cordon, furious at not being allowed in. The Odessa governor, Mikheil Saakashvili, said police had received information about “provocations” planned for the anniversary. Authorities said there had been an anonymous bomb threat early in the morning and the area had been closed off for a search. Those outside were certain the bomb threat was a pretext to prevent them from gathering, and no officials made any attempt to keep the crowds informed about when or whether they would be let in. There were shouts of “Shame!” and “Fascists!” as the crowd became angrier. Many people left flowers outside the perimeter and went home. At one point, a bus arrived carrying a the mothers of some of those who died. A group of Ukrainian nationalists shouted: “Glory to Ukraine!” as they disembarked from the bus, leaving the women visibly shaken. The events in Odessa were one of the most controversial chapters of the period that began with the Maidan protests in Kiev in February 2014 and ended with a separatist uprising in parts of east Ukraine that received Russian military and financial backing. On 2 May 2014, as pro-Russian protests were growing in many of the cities in south and east Ukraine, street clashes between pro-Russians and Ukrainians nationalists ended with the pro-Russians blocked into the five-storey Trade Unions building, which was then set on fire. Dozens burned to death inside. The deaths were portrayed as a “fascist massacre” by Russian media, and acted as a recruiting sergeant for the separatist cause in east Ukraine. In Kiev, Russian media and security agencies were accused of stirring up and manipulating local discontent, furious at the pro-western turn Ukraine’s post-Maidan government wanted to take. After events in Donetsk and Luhansk regions led to a war and thousands of deaths, some have claimed the Odessa events marked a “victory” over pro-Russian sentiment in the city. Nationalist MP Ihor Mosiychuk wrote on Facebook that 2 May should be a “great national holiday”, as it was the day in which separatist sentiment was crushed in Odessa. In the run-up to the second anniversary, Saakashvili had pleaded with Kiev to send reinforcements into the city, fearing “provocations” from Russia or local separatist groups. About 300 members of Azov, formerly a volunteer battalion with many far-right members and now part of the official National Guard, were dispatched to Odessa. By the early evening, the day appeared to have passed more or less peacefully, though police reported 14 arrests for public order offences. Yuri Tkachev, who runs a news website many believe is sympathetic to the separatist cause, said the “pro-Russian” movement in the city was actually not pro-Moscow but more anti-Kiev and against the Maidan protest movement. “Of course there are people who would cheer if Putin came, but they are not the majority,” he said. Odessa remains a divided city, said Tkachev, but with the leaders of the separatist movement either fled or jailed, there “are no achievable goals or any understanding of how to act” among their supporters. An investigation into the events has stalled. While 20 pro-Russian activists are standing trial for the riots that took place earlier in the day, nobody has been charged with the events in the Trade Unions building that led to most of the deaths. Earlier in the day, a smaller group of pro-Ukrainians came to pay their respects at the site in the city centre where the first death occurred, a Ukrainian activist shot in the city centre. They sang the Ukrainian national anthem and laid flowers at the spot. “Some people think of today as a victory day,” said Yuri, who did not want to give his surname but said he had been involved in the clashes on 2 May. “But it’s hard to think of it as a victory when our city is still split and one half of the city doesn’t think of itself as Ukrainian.”",REAL
Select committee chief lashes out at Sir Philip Green over BHS sale,"The MP leading an analysis into the collapse of BHS has lashed out at its former owner Sir Philip Green over the sale of the business to people who “crash[ed] it into a cliff”. The retail billionaire, his wife Tina and Anthony Grabiner, chairman of Green’s retail empire Arcadia for more than a decade, are being asked to appear before two parliamentary committees to give evidence about the high street chain’s demise. Iain Wright MP, who chairs the Commons business, innovation and skills select committee, said Green had “enormous questions” to answer. Wright highlighted the sale of the business to Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt who bought BHS via a company called Retail Acquisitions last year. He said: “The question that we want to ask Sir Philip Green is, ‘You bought BHS, took enormous sums out of the business, the pension scheme went from surplus to deficit and then you sold it for a pound to somebody who was twice bankrupt and who had no experience whatsoever of the retail sector – is that appropriate stewardship of a big, important company?’” Retail Acquisitions argues that it spent £10,000,001 to buy BHS, because it invested £10m in shares on top of the deal’s notional £1 price tag. Wright said: “So it’s a case of ‘is it right that people can buy a company, strip it, in many respects, of cash in terms of dividends without real regard to pensions or to employees and then sell it for a pound to untried and untested people who then crash it into a cliff?’” He told Radio 4’s Today programme: “We are keen to find out who knew what, when. This issue over the sale and acquisition of BHS raises enormous questions.” MPs on the committee as well as those on the work and pensions committee are taking evidence on BHS. Green declined to comment. Wright said: “When you sell a business do you have any further responsibility or do you start to crash it into the cliff and then bail out just before it does crash? Those are things we want to look at on the business select committee and we also want to see whether the system is fit for purpose in making sure we can create long-term value rather than making sure that people can extract value out of businesses to the detriment of employees and to the detriment, ultimately, potentially, of the taxpayer.” While Wright has yet to announce a list of witnesses that the business select committee wants to question, they are expected to be the same as those called by Frank Field, chair of the Commons work and pensions committee. BHS called in administrators in March, putting almost 11,000 jobs at risk, a year after Arcadia’s 15-year ownership ended. Questions are now being asked about how its £571m pension deficit will affect the Pension Protection Fund, a rescue scheme funded by contributions from other pension pots. Sports Direct tycoon and Newcastle United Mike Ashley, who has resisted calls to appear before MPs over working conditions in his own retail empire, has indicated that he could bid for BHS. Green is also thought to have considered a move to buy back the brand he once owned, while boardroom veteran and former Asda boss Allan Leighton has also been linked with a rescue bid.",REAL
Alyson Bailes obituary,"Alyson Bailes, who has died aged 67 of cancer, worked for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for 33 years, both in London and as a diplomat in Hungary, West Germany, China, Norway and Belgium. She was British ambassador to Finland, 2000-02. However, as she herself put it, she “kept escaping for career breaks and different perspectives”. Her secondments included posts with the Ministry of Defence in London and Nato in Brussels. She was very proud of her work on Nato enlargement into eastern Europe, which she considered to be a major contribution to peace and stability. She was never ambitious for rank for its own sake and her leadership of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute from 2002 until 2007, and her recent teaching roles, at the University of Iceland and the College of Europe, gave her the greatest satisfaction and achievement. Her flair for languages was remarkable. She spoke and read French, Hungarian, German, Mandarin Chinese, Norwegian, Finnish and Swedish at what she herself described as “an operational level”. She also had reading knowledge of Danish, Icelandic, Faroese and Dutch. Sir Kim Darroch, British ambassador in Washington, describes her as “always the cleverest person in the room, and sometimes, when she was bored, she would admit to having been translating something from Hungarian into Mandarin just as a mental exercise to keep her brain occupied”. He also noted Alyson’s steadiness and calmness: “I never saw her get angry or flustered. She was always extremely kind and never gave the impression of thinking ill of anybody.” This calmness under fire was tested in March 1979 when she was sitting next to the British ambassador Sir Richard Sykes when he was shot dead by Irish terrorists outside his home in The Hague. It was only by chance that she was in the ambassador’s car, as she had travelled to The Hague for meetings with Sir Edmund Dell and his team of “Three Wise Men” appointed by the European council to advise on institutional improvements in the European community before Greek accession. Alyson went on to speak at a press conference about the incident at the British embassy, then resumed her planned programme of meetings. The eldest of three children of Barbara (nee Martin) and John-Lloyd Bailes, both of whom were teachers, Alyson was born in Liverpool and educated at the Belvedere school in the city. She went to Somerville College, Oxford, in 1966, aged 17, with a scholarship to read modern history, and graduated in 1969 with a first. In 2001 she was made an honorary fellow of the college. She joined the Foreign Office as a junior diplomat in September 1969, having achieved full marks in the entrance exam. It was a very different world from today. All ambassadors were men (the first British female ambassador was appointed in 1976). Alyson’s duties as a junior diplomat included carrying coals for the open hearth fire which heated the office; and writing up policy documents in pen and ink, which would be copied out by typists using carbon paper. With her customary dry humour, she noted that “it was considered a sign of unusual keenness to arrive in the office before 10”. A month after joining the FCO, she was interviewed by the Sunday Times and was asked whether there would ever be a female British ambassador? Would Alyson be Her Excellency in 20 years’ time? She replied that she couldn’t begin to imagine herself being that old: “But I suppose, by the time I am, I might be wanting to be an ambassador.” In fact it was 30 years later that she took up her post as ambassador to Finland. By then there had been a dozen female ambassadors and high commissioners, but it was still relatively uncommon for a woman to get a top post in Europe. Now numbers have risen to more than 30 in top posts. Darroch believes Alyson could have been an ambassador earlier “if she had pushed herself more and played office politics.”. As an expert on global defence issues, from 2011 until 2014 she was a member of the Trident Commission on UK nuclear weapons policy established by the thinktank BASIC. Its co-chair, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former foreign secretary, said: “Very often you find that people who have been diplomats all their lives have become so used to giving a diplomatic answer on behalf of the government that they can’t do anything else. Alyson was different ... She didn’t just give an opinion; she was always trying to make progress to bring the two sides closer together and she had the skills to do this.” As well as funny, generous and thoughtful, Alyson was interesting and interested, not only in diplomacy and international relations, but also in sci-fi (both books and films), embroidery, singing in choirs wherever she was posted, the novels of Dorothy Dunnett (she wrote articles for the Dorothy Dunnett Society), Icelandic heavy metal music and, most recently, heavy metal music from the Faroe Islands. This last was not an interest shared by her many friends. She is survived by her mother, her brother, Martin, and her sister, Jane. • Alyson Judith Kirtley Bailes, diplomat and political scientist, born 6 April 1949; died 29 April 2016",REAL
"Inside Ricu, the shadowy propaganda unit inspired by the cold war","The shadowy Whitehall unit at the heart of the British government’s covert strategic communications campaign was inspired by a clandestine cold war propaganda programme. But while the cold war offensive targeted communism, trade unionists and newspapers in developing countries, the current operations are aimed at Muslims, both in Britain and the Middle East. The British-based element of the campaign is part of the Prevent counter-radicalisation programme and is run by the Home Office’s Research, Information and Communications Unit, or Ricu. Ricu officials dislike the word propaganda: they prefer the term strategic communications. The extraordinary ambitions of these communications are set out in Ricu documents seen by the Guardian. “Strategic communications aims to effect behavioural and attitudinal change,” says one paper. For almost two years Ricu’s focus has been on Islamic State, whose own online propaganda has proven powerful. Isis is calculated to be posting an average of 18 messages a day, many of them showing not violence, but flowers, forests and flowing streams, to emphasise the natural beauty of the territory under its control. To counter this, Ricu says privately that it is working “at an industrial scale and pace”. While it does produce some government-branded communications, the key to its counter-radicalisation messages is that they are disseminated through “discreet campaigns supported by Ricu without any acknowledgment of UK government support”. It uses YouTube, Twitter and Facebook as well as more traditional propaganda methods, such as feeding stories to newspapers, including the Guardian, and leafleting. Under the umbrella of Prevent Ricu is based in the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT), in the Home Office’s Westminster HQ. Charles Farr, a former MI6 officer and head of the OSCT, set up the unit shortly after arriving at the Home Office in 2007. Ricu was modelled on the Information Research Department (IRD), a propaganda unit established in 1948 by the Attlee government. The IRD’s exploits included hoodwinking journalists and academics and targeting trade unionists, before it was shut down in 1977. Farr told MPs that the new unit had two functions: advising officials “from a brigade commander in Helmand province through to a chief constable in Yorkshire” on the language they should use to describe terrorism and the government’s response; and challenging the propaganda of al-Qaida and others. Some of the unit’s funding came from the budget for Prevent, the controversial counter-radicalisation programme. This funding has risen steeply: for 2015-16, the unit’s budget was £17m, more than five times as much as three years earlier. Ricu has hired linguists, psychologists and anthropologists as well as counter-terrorism strategists, digital media experts, film-makers and marketing consultants. It has three divisions: a monitoring and coordination team to watch and study digital and traditional media; an insight and analysis team to research audience reactions; and a domestic and international campaigns team to deliver the covert propaganda. When the Home Office revised Prevent in June 2011, it declared that Ricu’s impact had been “variable”, and that more effort to “identify credible partners” and develop powerful narratives and “more professional counter-narrative products” was needed. The following January, the home secretary, Theresa May, informed the intelligence and security committee that Ricu was “road-testing some quite innovative approaches to counter-ideological messages”. By the end of the year, the unit had a new head, Richard Chalk. A former Conservative parliamentary candidate and communications chief, Chalk arrived after working in Baghdad for Bell Pottinger, the British PR firm. That work – some of which remains classified – included “information operations” intended to help undermine the insurgency. On his return to the UK he became chief of staff for the then Tory party co-chair, Sayeeda Warsi. The Home Office says he was hired to head Ricu because of his expertise in counter-terrorism strategic communications. Under Chalk’s leadership, Ricu began communicating with British Muslims in a manner more reminiscent of counter-insurgency operations than a traditional public information campaign: disseminating messages through the use of subterfuge. Delivering the propaganda Much of the work is outsourced. Ricu’s favoured contractor is Breakthrough Media Network Ltd, a company operating from an anonymous office block near Waterloo station in central London. Nothing inside, other than a series of locked doors and CCTV cameras, suggests the nature of the company’s work. Like Chalk, one of Breakthrough’s two directors, Scott Brown, worked for the Conservatives before joining Bell Pottinger’s information operations team in Baghdad. The other, Robert Elliott, is a former reality TV producer. Both are in their 30s and attended the same school in Essex. Working under contract to Ricu, Breakthrough produces masses of digital material – films, Twitter feeds, Facebook profiles, YouTube clips, online radio content and websites. It says these are often “hosted” by Muslim civil society groups. One Breakthrough document seen by the Guardian explains that its objective is to “influence online conversations by being embedded within target communities via a network of moderate organisations that are supportive of it’s [sic] goals”. While at least one entity Ricu has used to disseminate its messages – Help for Syria – has been designed for a specific counter-radicalisation message by Breakthrough, it usually works with groups that already exist. One person familiar with Ricu’s work says that such groups are monitored closely before any approach is made. Sometimes, the source added, they are very small. “It could be just some guy with a blog, but it was always someone HMG [Her Majesty’s government] could work with. It’s not a genuine partnership, however: it’s a manipulative arrangement.” Ricu does not fund these groups, instead funding Breakthrough’s work to produce these groups’ communications. Some of the groups with which Breakthrough works on Ricu’s behalf insist they retain editorial control and that Ricu and Breakthrough’s help amplifies their messages. Privately, however, Breakthrough says it is providing “Ricu with effective ways of communicating its own messages through credible civil society organisations”. Ricu’s briefing notes are even clearer about who is in charge: “Whilst retaining editorial control over all Ricu-produced material, Ricu provides a range of support and expertise to CSOs [civil society organisations] to help them shape campaigns, produce products and mobilise their stakeholders.” As of February last year, according to one document, the unit had run 13 national campaigns, producing a total of 950 physical and online products, which had been accessed by audiences more than a million times. Chalk is an occasional visitor to Breakthrough’s offices. One source said: “Sometimes he sits in the edit suites, watching the work. It’s not exactly scripted by Ricu, but they’ll make it clear that they want a particular form of words to be used at a particular point in a film.” A Breakthrough source said that as the government was paying for the contract, Ricu was within its rights to visit the edit suite to check the quality of the work. Ricu and Breakthrough focus on “Prevent priority areas” in the UK, using keywords and paid-for Google and Facebook adverts to target people whose browsing history suggests they are Muslims. Using so-called “promotion and diversion techniques”, Breakthrough promotes Ricu’s messages to browsers who are searching for terms such as Isis, Khalifa and “What does the Qur’an say about jihad?”. Last year, Breakthrough set up a public relations company, Horizon PR, as a joint enterprise with M&amp;C Saatchi. “Horizon was created to support the public relations of civil society groups, voluntary organisations and NGOs [non-governmental organisations] who want to drive positive social change,” a Saatchi spokesman said. Horizon has promoted the work of community groups as part of Breakthrough’s contract with Ricu. Journalists contacted by Horizon have not been told that the company was representing the groups as part of the Ricu contract. Breakthrough is understood to say that there was no obligation to disclose the government’s involvement. Breakthrough says in one document that it “understands the sensitive nature of Ricu’s work and adheres to the highest standards of security and confidentiality”. Were Ricu’s involvement to be exposed, there would be a negative impact not only on the credibility of the messages, but on “Ricu, Prevent and the Home Office’s reputation”. The purpose of this work, Breakthrough makes clear, is to help the British government “promote a reconciled British Muslim identity” while keeping its involvement hidden, as “any content or messaging attributed to the state are highly unlikely to have any credibility among these audiences”. To achieve the government’s aim, Ricu is attempting to change the way young British Muslims think and act: time and again the documents talk about “implementing attitudinal and behavioural change communications”; “measurable attitudinal change outcomes”; and “campaigns designed to deliver real attitudinal and behavioural change”. ‘They’re not what they seem’ Breakthrough has contracts with several non-governmental bodies and has been transparent about governmental support for communications campaigns in east Africa. But several sources say its work for Ricu dwarfs its other operations. Breakthrough’s relationship with the unit is lucrative. In 2012-13, the firm received £448,286 from its contracts with the OSCT. By 2013-14, this had increased to £5,911,719. In total, the company has earned £11.8m from the OSCT since 2012. One person with knowledge of Ricu’s work said some freelancers working with Breakthrough do not appear to know they are engaged in covert propaganda. Several former Breakthrough employees, both freelance and staff, told the Guardian they had not heard of Ricu – a suggestion Breakthrough is understood to contest. One former employee said she left after realising she was working on propaganda because she considered the work to be “stupid and reprehensible”. Another, a freelance, said she realised the connection after Breakthrough managers repeatedly requested editing changes. “It became obvious that it was being directed from outside the company. It was a slightly more shadowy process. I asked where the money was coming from and they said the Home Office. I was uneasy enough to get out. They are not what they seem.” The Home Office refused to answer questions about Ricu’s work and would not permit anyone from the unit to be interviewed. It would not comment on the extent of the home secretary’s oversight of Ricu; nor would it respond to suggestions that its covert support for Muslim organisations risks undermining support from Muslim civil society as a whole. It issued a statement, however, saying it was working with communities, civil society groups and individuals to counter the “twisted narrative” of terrorists and extremists. “We are proud of the support Ricu has provided to organisations working on the frontline to challenge the warped ideology of groups such as Daesh [Isis], and to protect communities,” the statement said. “This work can involve sensitive issues, vulnerable communities and hard-to-reach audiences, and it has been important to build relationships out of the media glare. We respect the bravery of individuals and organisations who choose to speak out against violence and extremism and it is right that we support and protect them. “Our guiding principle has to be whether or not any organisation we work with is itself happy to talk publicly about what they do. At the same time we are as open as we can be and have referenced the role of Ricu in publications and in parliament.” Unlike Ricu, Breakthrough did provide answers to the Guardian’s questions but said it regarded those answers as confidential and not for publication. In a statement, it said: “Breakthrough Media is enormously proud to be able to provide a wide range of community groups with the help and support they need to tell their stories, confront extremism in all its forms and build stronger, safer communities.” Officials who are familiar with the work told the Guardian that it was a good and valuable effort. One person involved acknowledged that the work amounted to propaganda but added: “All we’re trying to do is stop people becoming suicide bombers.” Reporting team: Ian Cobain, Alice Ross, Rob Evans, Mona Mahmood, Nick Fielding and Safak Timur",REAL
Bernie Sanders: 'I hope my legacy will be that I was a very good president',"Bernie Sanders is not ready to discuss his campaign in the past tense. “I am not into legacy,” he told the Guardian on Sunday when asked to sum up his lasting achievements after a year of insurgency. “I hope my legacy will be that I was a very good president of the United States.” To critics, the defiance that marked the campaign’s first anniversary this weekend may smack of hubris bordering on the delusional. After Hillary Clinton stretched her delegate lead again last week with strong wins on the east coast, many Democrats are calling for reconciliation instead. But for the Bernie faithful, fighting talk remains entirely reasonable. Sanders trails by 55 to 45% among pledged delegates and acknowledges it will be an “uphill” struggle to win the 65% of those remaining needed to turn the nomination race around. Yet he believes a favourable set of final states means this mathematical possibility should not be dismissed. “Right now, the next month and a half, we are fighting to win every delegate that we can,” Sanders told reporters earlier in the day, ahead of an Indiana primary on Tuesday that he hopes will begin another string of last minute victories. As for Clinton’s even larger lead among so-called superdelegates – the party leaders allowed to cast votes independently of election results – this is simply grist to the mill: proof of a corrupt nomination system, and a target for new pressure from voters in states where Sanders has won biggest. But behind the bluster lies a subtle change in tone in the campaign’s message as it returned to Washington DC this weekend. The first sign of this new, underlying, realism, is a reset of expectations. It is time to stress how far senator has come since he announced his candidacy here a year ago, rather than how much further he still has to go. “If any of you here would have bet that on May 1, Bernie Sanders would have won 17 primaries and caucuses and if you had the odds I think you would have had a year ago, I don’t think you would be sitting here because you would be very wealthy individuals,” he told reporters at the National Press Club. Then there are the occasional lapses into the past tense and hints that there will plenty of time for reflection in the months to come. “We are proud of the campaign that we ran,” added Sanders. “Frankly in hindsight you can always think of things that you should have done better, and some day I will tell you all those things.” Even the list of facts and figures reeled out to put pressure on superdelegates are as much about underscoring how the party has already changed as they are a realistic belief that some of Clinton’s most ardent supporters will suddenly now change their minds. Take campaign finance for example. Some Sanders critics leapt at end-of-month figures showing his fundraising among donors slowed to “just” $26m in April – something he attributes to most of the key contests now being behind them, but others saw as a sign of the beginning of the end. But with $200m raised from 7.4 million individual donations, the real legacy has arguably already been secured. “We have shown that you can run a political campaign without the benefit of Super Pacs and big money interests,” explains Sanders. Then there are the 1.1 million supporters who have turned up to rallies in the last year, a total Sanders hopes to add to “significantly” with a few blow-out final rallies in California before it votes. These may not have been enough to overcome structural obstacles in key states like New York, where independents were not allowed to vote in the Democratic primary, but they point to enthusiasm that Sanders clearly believes will long outlast him. “We have won, in a state after state, a strong majority of the votes of younger people, voters under 45 years of age,” said the 74-year-old senator. “In other words, the ideas that we are fighting for are the future of the Democratic party and in fact the future of this country. The reason for that is that the issues that we are talking about are the issues that are on the minds of the American people.” And what are these issues? “People know, whether conservative or progressive, that a corrupt campaign finance system is undermining American democracy, they understand that there is something fundamentally wrong when the average American is working longer hours for lower wages,” he said, adding a long list of his stump speech pledges: countering climate change, reforming education and healthcare, breaking up the biggest banks. It is these issues that Sanders intends to promote when he arrives in Philadelphia in July for the party’s national convention. Yes, there will be arcane fights over whether super delegates are reflecting the will of all the voters in all the states, but more importantly, his campaign hopes there will be plenty of agreement too about how much the party has changed on the issues that really matter.",REAL
Emma Thompson: ‘I do not want to die before closing the pay gap’,"I was excited as a young woman about the future for our sex. I thought as I&nbsp;grew up that the world was ready for the positive developments that the inclusion of women in all walks of life and in particular in the power system, would bring. To be sure, there have been some good shifts – but by and large the dreams of my generation have not been realised. I am backing the Women’s Equality party because I really do not want to die before closing the pay gap, which stands, in our great and supposedly modern capital city, at 23%. We keep being told that closing it is very “complicated”. Why? I am backing it, too, because I am shocked that 85% of young women in London are sexually harassed every day. I want my son to see gentleness and caring as manly attributes, and my daughter to see strength of purpose and voice as feminine. I am very worried about the hyper-sexualisation of our children and I do not see that being addressed anywhere else. I am backing the WEP because it is putting issues of caring – for children and for the elderly – at the top of its agenda. The WEP wants our economy and our education systems to work fairly for men and women and it wants to see women in positions of authority in equal&nbsp;numbers. All the above are at the top of the list of WEP’s priorities and I look forward to helping it with some of its campaigns. I have met and talked with them and a more committed, bright, inspiring bunch of women with fantastic ideas I&nbsp;have never found. They are only asking for half my votes in the elections on 5 May, so I can continue to support my old allegiances with the other half. Give half your votes to the Women’s Equality party on 5 May. We’re half the population and equality is way, way overdue. Emma Thompson London • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",REAL
"EU vote too important to be dominated by Tory politics, says minister","A Conservative cabinet minister has made a direct plea to supporters of other political parties to vote in favour of Britain’s membership of the EU by warning that Brexit would be a “hugely retrograde step” for the environment. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, the environment secretary, Liz Truss, said the referendum was too important to be dominated by internal Tory politics. Truss argued that the EU was responsible for major global breakthroughs such as the dramatic reduction in the levels of acid rain and reducing the hole in the world’s ozone layer. The fact that the UK shared its air and oceans with European countries, and that 80% of birds migrated across borders, meant that continued collaboration was essential, she added. “What would I say to readers of the Guardian is that this isn’t just a debate in the Conservative party – that is for me a very small part of it. This is a debate about our country. People who care about those issues, who care about us being an outward-facing, internationally-focused country, go out and vote,” said Truss. The minister singled out the Labour party, urging its voters not to let the controversy engulfing it distract them from the “vital decision on 23 June”. “This is bigger than party politics,” she added. It came as Truss faced criticism from Eurosceptic MPs after signing up to a declaration with the former Labour leader Ed Miliband, the former Liberal Democrat energy secretary Ed Davey and the Green MP, Caroline Lucas, describing Brexit campaigners as “extreme and outdated”. Miliband said the four had put together an unprecedented partnership in order to fight for the environment. They published a pamphlet that accused leave campaigners of dismissing vital green policies and climate change as “mumbo jumbo”, and said EU collaboration was the only hope in tackling global warming. But Gisela Stuart, the Labour MP who chairs Vote Leave, accused Truss and others of “descending into absurdity”. “It seems there is no good in the world that they cannot somehow attribute to the EU and no imagined disaster they cannot predict if we vote leave.” But Truss told the Guardian that she believed working with countries that were closest geographically was key, not least because industrial operations across Europe were causing pollution in the UK. “We share our air. Up to 50% of all particulate matter in UK air comes from the European continent,” she said. “It is a classic tragedy of the commons: you produce pollution but you are not feeling the full effect of it so that is why we need to work together.” She claimed that membership of the EU had helped shore up depleted stocks of fish such as cod; cleaned up the sea and beaches; helped reduce the illegal trade of ivory and rhino horns; and contributed to tackling animal disease. She also said it was responsibly for cutting sulphur dioxide levels by 94% leading to the “end of the threat of acid rain, which was destroying forests and historic buildings”. Truss said that Margaret Thatcher’s push for the Montreal protocol had helped address the hole in the ozone layer. She claimed that membership of the EU magnified Britain’s global influence. “When you are speaking for 500 million people that really carries weight.” The environment secretary also claimed that farmers would be “much better off remaining in a reformed EU”, a view that contradicts George Eustice, who is not just a Conservative colleague but the farming minister within her own department. He recently welcomed a survey by Farmers Weekly that found 58% of farmers would vote for Brexit, while 31% wanted to see Britain remain in the EU. “It is no surprise that farmers want to leave the EU. Virtually every problem they bring to me is a direct consequence of dysfunctional EU rules and regulations,” said Eustice, who is a prominent out campaigner. He also challenged the latest collaboration with Miliband, saying Brexit would allow Britain to regain control. Truss would not comment on Eustice personally but said farmers benefited from common rules and said trade in the food industry was worth billions, with Europe the easiest market to reach. “If you look at export products like beef or lamb to the US we are still not in that market 20 years later.” She said the key debate was over what sort of country Britain wanted to be. ”That is a really important question rather than what is happening in the Conservative party... It doesn’t matter what party people vote for.” Sam Lowe, of Friends of the Earth, welcomed the intervention saying that climate change affected everyone, regardless of their political affiliation. But a Vote Leave spokesman accused Truss of “losing all sense of perspective”, and asked why she believed the British government would be unwilling protect the environment in a post-Brexit world. “Tackling climate change is a global challenge yet we have allowed our voice at international institutions to be diminished by our EU membership ... It’s time for pro-EU campaigners to stop pretending that Britain – the fifth largest economy, a science superpower and champion of the green agenda – is powerless outside of the EU.”",REAL
‘Obama out’: a brief history of mic drops,"No mic drop in history will ever be as thoroughly scrutinised as the one performed by Barack Obama during his final White House correspondents’ dinner on Saturday evening. Historians hundreds of years from now will refer to his “Obama out” in the same breath as the Emancipation Proclamation and “Mr Gorbachev, tear down this wall.” But how did we get here, and what does it all mean? As a gesture, the mic drop signals the end of a statement so definitive that it cannot possibly be followed. It’s an act of destruction, as described in Eric B and Rakim’s 1987 single I Ain’t No Joke: “I used to let the mic smoke / Now I slam it when I’m done and make sure it’s broke.” Notable mic-droppers over time have included everyone from Eddie Murphy to Chris Rock to the Arctic Monkeys’ Alex Turner. Interestingly, fictional Barack Obama is an inveterate mic-dropper. Key &amp; Peele sketches have depicted Obama dropping the mic, as has Saturday Night Live and, in January of this year, YouTubers the Gregory Brothers songified Obama’s state of the union address and uploaded the results as Obama Mic Drop: 1999. Realistically, it was only a matter of time before the real-life Obama caught up with his make-believe counterparts. Saturday’s mic drop, however, was a vast improvement on the real Obama’s previous efforts. In April 2012, during an appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, the US president concluded a Slow Jam the News segment not by dropping the mic, but by sort of prissily flinging it to the ground, much in the way a child would if they saw a wasp on their ice-cream. However, Obama should remember to exercise caution, for the mic drop has been known to backfire. Just look at Google’s April fool this year – a gif of a mic-dropping Minion that, when deployed in Gmail, blocked all replies from the recipient. Some people who used it claimed they lost their jobs as a result, and Google had to sheepishly withdraw the prank. Remember, Mr President, with great mic drops comes great responsibility.",REAL
Welsh election eclipsed by nationwide issues but voters stay engaged,"The leader of Welsh Labour, Carwyn Jones, was at Bridgend College to speak about his party’s manifesto pledge to create 100,000 all-age apprenticeships. He chatted with young would-be plumbers and carpenters, and got his hands dirty having a go at bricklaying. But then, as so often, he had to veer off-piste to answer a barrage of questions about subjects other than those in the control of the Welsh assembly, including the allegations of antisemitism within Labour; the credibility of Jeremy Corbyn and the EU referendum. In short, Welsh-only topics are not top of everyone’s concerns. “It can be difficult,” Jones told the Guardian. “The European issue, in particular, overshadows everything else. We know that the London broadcast media is obsessed with it.” Jones, however, who succeeded Rhodri Morgan as Welsh first minister in 2009 and has been the most senior UK Labour leader since the resignation of Gordon Brown as prime minister the following year, believes more Welsh citizens are engaged in this election campaign. “What’s struck me in my fifth campaign is that more people are aware there is an election. They’re not saying, what election? They are much more aware of the election, of devolution,” he said. The fourth Welsh assembly ended in mid-March in shambolic fashion. The Labour government, which ruled with half of the assembly’s 60 seats, suffered an embarrassing defeat over an eye-catching and wide-ranging health bill that included a crackdown on e-cigarettes. Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, had been prepared to back the bill but changed its mind after a Labour minister, in a clumsy attempt at end-of-term humour, called the party a “cheap date” – suggesting its support was easily won. Five years of work was lost in an instant. It made both parties, and indeed the assembly itself look less than competent, and the Tories, the second biggest party going into this campaign, were champing at the bit. Within days the spat seemed irrelevant. The steel crisis – centred on Port Talbot, 15 miles along the south coast from Bridgend – broke, followed by the Panama Papers saga. Then came Corbyn’s problems over antisemitism in the Labour party. Meanwhile, the question of EU membership has swirled around every debate, visit and photo opportunity. Roger Scully, a professor of political science at Cardiff University, said it was unfortunate the campaign had been so overshadowed, likening it to the 2003 election when Welsh-only issues were sidelined by the Iraq war. “It is a pity,” he said. “The Welsh assembly passes laws and control major areas of public policy like education and the NHS. The way those powers are exercised ought to be subject to proper scrutiny.” He believes Labour may have benefited most from the distractions. “Research suggests most people in Wales are not particularly impressed by Welsh Labour’s record on health and education … if people aren’t paying so much attention to those areas, that may help them.” A poll last week suggested Labour would slip to 28 seats, and privately party strategists say they would be content with that result. The poll has the Tories dropping to third place with 10 seats and Plaid leapfrogging them with 13 seats. Jones, who has been assembly member for Bridgend since the first election in 1999, played down the polls. “I’ve learned there are fine margins between success and failure. I do know that we are in very good heart, we’re still out there knocking on doors, meeting people. “With the work we’re putting in and a bit of luck we can be in the situation we are in now. There are lots of ifs and buts, a lot of factors that nobody can control,” he said. Significantly, Jones is prepared, even now, to think about working with others. “From my perspective we couldn’t work with the Tories or Ukip, they are too far to the right of us,” he said. “When it comes to Plaid and the Lib Dems [who are predicted to plunge from five to two seats], of course we can work with them. We’ve done it in the past. We will look at the situation after Thursday. Our objective is to be in a position where we can govern alone. But if we need to discuss issues with other parties, of course we will.” Plaid and its charismatic leader, Leanne Wood, best known on the national stage for slapping down the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, during one of last year’s general election debates, have run an attractive, positive campaign. Wood told the Guardian that Labour was an uninspiring establishment party. “Given that we’ve had 17 years of Labour leading the government, they are the establishment. They are stale, tired,” she said. The former probation officer with a rebellious streak, who was once expelled from the Welsh assembly after calling the Queen “Mrs Windsor”, would certainly be a colourful character in a coalition government. The Tories are thought to have been badly hit by the Port Talbot crisis and the Panama Papers, but are working hard to refocus the electorate’s attention back to devolved issues. Andrew RT Davies, the Welsh Conservative leader, said people on the doorstep wanted to speak about the issues the assembly had power over. “They do want to talk about the health service, they do want to talk about education, they do want to talk about job security. Those are all factors that people gladly engage in,” he said. It is certainly true that the BBC leaders’ debate in Cardiff sparked into life when an audience member berated Jones over the contentious subject of treatment for cancer patients, yelling at him: “Rhag eich cywilydd!” or “Shame on you!” Meanwhile, none of the main parties are ignoring Ukip. The party has never won a seat at the assembly but last week’s poll has Farage’s Welsh arm, for which the former Tory MPs Neil Hamilton and Mark Reckless are standing, winning seven seats – a result that would fundamentally change the makeup and feel of the assembly. While Jones was visiting Bridgend, half an hour down the M4 in Newport two Ukip stalwarts were busy refurbishing a 1930s art deco cinema, which is being rebranded as The Neon - Newport entertains our nation – a venue for gigs, comedy and films. Andy Byers, the secretary of the city’s Ukip branch, and James Peterson, the candidate for Newport East, are lapsed Labour voters who believe their new party is the true champion of the working man and woman. Byers, who grew up in Greater Manchester, said he had been attracted by Ukip’s “commonsense” approach. “I love my country, I’m a monarchist. All the other parties seem to be eroding our British identity. It bothers me that we’re losing that.” Peterson, who once worked at the Llanwern steelworks in Newport, where his father was a union representative, said though it was not a devolved issue, border control was the big talking point in the area. “When you say you’re from Ukip people want to talk about immigration. I think it’s because Ukip is the only party addressing it. I listen to their concerns and then talk about the issues that are devolved, like the NHS. But with Ukip there are no taboo subjects. If you speak to a Labour or Lib Dem person and mention immigration, you’re shot down in flames,” he said. As in the north of England, Ukip is expected to do well in places such as Newport among white working-class former Labour voters. It would be a major surprise if they did not win a seat here. This may be an election overshadowed by nationwide and worldwide issues, but that does not mean the Welsh electorate is unengaged. One of the apprentice carpenters at Bridgend, Luke Cavill, 20, was looking forward to voting for the first time. “The assembly makes decisions that affect the lives of all people in Wales. Of course I’ll be voting. This is important.”",REAL
Turkish journalists accuse Erdoğan of media witch-hunt,"Can Dündar appears in good spirits for a man facing espionage charges and a possible life sentence. The editor of Cumhuriyet, one of the last remaining bastions of media opposition to Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had appeared in court that morning over a documentary he produced on government corruption. It is one of two cases against him – in February, he was released from prison pending a spying trial over a story on arms shipments to Syria. “Turkey has never been a paradise for journalists but of course not a hell like this,” he said in an interview in his office. “Nowadays being a journalist is much more dangerous than ever and needs courage and self-confidence. “It’s a kind of witch-hunt ... like McCarthyism in the US in the 1950s.” Turkish journalists say local media outlets are facing one of the worst crackdowns on press freedoms since military rule in the 1980s. Prosecutors have opened close to 2,000 cases of insults to the president since Erdoğan took office in 2014, prominent journalists appear in court two or three times a week, Kurdish journalists are beaten or detained in the country’s restive south-east and foreign journalists have been harassed or deported. Turkey ranks 151st among 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders. Dündar was arrested in November with Cumhuriyet’s Ankara bureau chief, Erdem Gül, charged with espionage and divulging state secrets and held in jail. The arms shipment story, published six months earlier, had alleged the Turkish intelligence service, MİT, was sending weapons to rebels fighting Bashar al-Assad in Syria under the guise of humanitarian aid. Academics are also standing trial, accused of spreading propaganda by the separatist and outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK). The result is a climate of fear and intimidation that Turkish journalists say is an attempt at silencing the critical press. “Short of journalists being assassinated, we have every kind of problem,” said Özgür Öğret, a freelance reporter and the representative of the Committee to Protect Journalists in the country. Some journalists have been killed. Kadri Bağdu, a journalist with a pro-Kurdish daily that had received numerous threats over its coverage, was killed by unidentified gunmen in October 2014. Syrian media activists and journalists have been killed in Turkey by Islamic State operatives. Erdoğan remains as popular and powerful as ever – his Islamist AK party won an absolute majority in recent parliamentary elections, albeit in a deeply polarised country where a Kurdish insurgency rages in the south-east and Isis strikes in Ankara and Istanbul. “The only things that unite us in this country are cats and football,” said Öğret. “[But] if you kick a cat, you will be beaten up by a Kemalist, an Islamist or a socialist.” Journalists and experts say the attacks on press freedom in Turkey are a sign of Erdoğan’s intolerance of criticism and a symptom of a broader power struggle between the president and supporters of his former ally Fethullah Gülen, a preacher who now lives in exile in Pennsylvania. Erdoğan believes Gülenists in the judiciary and police constituted a “parallel state” that sought to overthrow him. Gülen’s acolytes in the Turkish judiciary helped remove hundreds of members of thesecular military establishment, but then friends turned on each other. News of a major corruption investigation into Erdoğan’s inner circle emerged in 2013, supposedly leaked by the Gülenists, creating a scandal that forced the resignations of government officials and furious accusations of an attempted coup. It may well have been. Even opponents of Erdoğan say the Gülenists may have thought they were powerful enough to topple the government. Or it may have been that all other rivals had been eliminated and the Gülen-Erdoğan alliance had run its course. Whatever the cause, Gülen’s group, Hizmet, quickly fell out of favour. Media companies linked to it were accused of funding and supporting terrorism, and government-appointed trustees took over the two main pro-Gülen media conglomerates – Koza İpek Holding and Feza, the parent company of Zaman newspaper. Zaman, once one of the largest circulation newspapers in Turkey, is now a resolutely pro-government title, its new executors unconcerned about keeping up a facade of impartiality. Most of the paper’s well-known writers and editors have gone into exile. Those that remain struggle. Levent Kenez, a former Zaman journalist who is editor of the pro-Gülen newspaper Meydan, said his newspaper’s circulation dropped from 100,000 to about 40,000 after the distribution company was taken over by the government and decided to no longer circulate it. Advertisers, which Kenez says are under pressure from the government, have also cut ties with the newspaper. “I wake up every day thinking thank God they haven’t yet taken over our newspaper, and every night it is thank God, we published today,” he said. “This is our psychology.” The state now controls most of the prominent media outlets in Turkey. “Erdoğan wants to be a sultan, not just for Turkey but the whole region, so he wants to stop any kind of criticism,” said Dündar. “It’s part of a political struggle of course, to stop every critical point of view. It’s not only in the press but TV, artists, academics. He hates criticism and this is the result of it, that Turkish prisons are full.” Journalists with pro-government outlets deny an attack on press freedom. They acknowledge the aftermath of the takeovers was handled poorly and embarrassing to Turkey, but say journalists with links to the Gülenist movement were not real journalists, rather puppets of a shadowy cult determined to overthrow the government. They insist the opposition press is vibrant, pointing to Sözcü, a widely read tabloid that mocks the president, and say anti-Erdoğan columns form the majority of online commentary in the country. “The Gülenists wanted to take over everything and organised conspiracies in order to reach their goal,” said Ibrahim Altay, the ombudsman of the Daily Sabah, a pro-AK party newspaper. “They established a hidden government that members of the Gülenist organisation were taking orders from. That’s not acceptable under any circumstances. I want my secular state.” Meryem Atlas, the paper’s opinion editor, acknowledged that there was still much work to be done to make Turkey more democratic and transparent, but said the international press was exaggerating Turkey’s problem and the media environment was a lot more free and critical than in the days of military rule, when all newspapers had to toe the junta’s line. Opposition journalists in Turkey say the political battle with the Gülenists has been used as a convenient club to shut down dissent among those with no links to them. Dündar, a staunch secularist, was initially accused of colluding with Hizmet in the arms shipment story for which he faces a life sentence if convicted. (An attempt to join Dündar’s case to that of the broader alleged Gülenist conspiracy was last month dismissed by a judge, but he still faces charges of espionage and divulging state secrets.) Dündar has pledged to continue the fight, though he has many more court appearances ahead. “If you’re a journalist in Erdoğan’s Turkey, you have to be either a prisoner or a suspect or jobless,” he said. “In the future there will be a Turkish exile press.” Insulting the president Turkey’s justice minister said in March during a parliamentary session that his ministry had allowed 1,845 cases of insulting the president to be prosecution since he began his tenure in 2014. Under Turkish law, prosecutions for the offence can go ahead if permission is granted by the ministry. Critics say the proliferation of these cases is a sign of a broader crackdown on dissent. Article 299 of the penal code sets a prison term of more than four years if the insult is published in the press, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and those prosecuted include journalists, activists, academics and artists. “Such cases, even when they do not result in imprisonment, take a toll on journalists,” the CPJ said. “Constantly appearing in court and defending the right to report or express an opinion amounts to obstruction of professional activities.” Last month Erdoğan’s lawyer even requested the prosecution in Germany of Jan Böhmermann, a German comedian who read out a poem alleged to have denigrated the Turkish president. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, accepted the request, saying it was up to the courts to decide the limits of freedom of expression. “Freedom of the press should never negate the respect for human dignity and freedom of the press can only survive and thrive with respect to human dignity,” Turkey’s prime minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, said at a press briefing in Gaziantep last week. “Very heavy insults against the president of a country that one should not really hear or read about, is that really part of the freedom of the press?” Many journalists in Turkey have criticised the EU for failing to speak up about issues of freedom of expression. Brussels has been accused of even going so far as to delay and water down an annual report on human rights in Turkey so as not to jeopardise Ankara-Brussels talks about relocating refugees and migrants. Erdoğan’s supporters point to a rise in rightwing politics and Islamophobia in Europe as evidence of Europe’s hypocrisy when it comes to freedom of speech issues in Turkey.",REAL
"Man, 72, pulled alive from rubble 13 days after Ecuadorian earthquake","A a 72–year-old man has been pulled alive from rubble 13 days after a huge earthquake which hit Ecuador. Manuel Vasquez was found by Venezuelan rescuers in a partially collapsed building in the fishing town of Jaramijó, the Venezuelan embassy in Quito said. They were carrying out a risk inspection at the site and after hearing sounds immediately entered to find Vasquez trapped between the walls of a room. He was freed after almost two weeks without food and taken to hospital with chronic renal failure, dehydration, confusion and a problem with his urinary tract. Vasquez had also lost several toes, had necrosis in both ankles and was disoriented, the embassy added. He remains in hospital. The team that rescued Vasquez were from the Fuerza de Tarea Humanitaria Simón Bolívar. It was a miraculous rescue days after search teams presumed the last of the survivors had been found. The 7.8-magnitude earthquake that hit Ecuador on 16 April killed more than 650 people, with tens of thousands injured and dozens missing. There have been several strong tremors and more than 700 aftershocks since the original quake, causing panic but little additional damage. Tremors are expected to continue for several weeks. With nearly 7,000 buildings destroyed, more than 26,000 people are living in shelters. About 14,000 security personnel are keeping order in the affected areas. Ecuador’s vice president, Jorge Glas, described the quake as the strongest to hit the country in years. Survivors in the quake zone have been receiving food, water and medicine from the government and scores of foreign aid workers, but the president, Rafael Correa, has acknowledged that the poor condition of roads delayed the arrival of aid to some communities. He estimated the cost of the damage at between $2bn and $3bn. Falling oil revenues have already left the country of nearly 16 million people facing near-zero growth and lower investment. Ecuador’s private banking association recently said its member banks would defer payments on credit cards, loans and mortgages for clients in the quake zone for three months in order to assist reconstruction efforts.",REAL
Chinese Communist party suspends tycoon after Xi Jinping outburst,"China has suspended an outspoken property magnate from the Communist party after he publicly questioned President Xi Jinping’s attempts to bring the country’s media to heel. In February, just days after Xi demanded absolute loyalty from China’s party-controlled press, Ren Zhiqiang challenged the move on social media. “When did the people’s government change into the party’s government?” Ren, a sharp-tongued tycoon who some call China’s Donald Trump, wrote to his tens of millions of online followers. The internet watchdog, the Cyberspace Administration of China, responded by closing the 65-year-old’s social media accounts and accusing him of spreading illegal information. A government spokesperson said Ren’s comments were a “vile influence”. State media announced Ren’s long-awaited punishment on Monday in a brief dispatch. China Radio International said he had “violated the political discipline of the party” and had been suspended from the party for a year. “Ren’s remarks on online platforms and during public occasions have run counter to the party’s basic policies on multiple occasions,” the state-controlled news group added. Ren’s suspension – a punishment less severe than some had anticipated – has come amid severe political tightening in China. Last week China’s rubber-stamp parliament gave the green light to a controversial law placing foreign non-governmental organisations operating in China under the control of the security services. Critics say the law is designed to force NGOs seen by Beijing as potential threats out of the country. In February, Xi toured three state media organisations as part of what one expert called a “no-holds barred” attempt to seize control of the news agenda. Xi told Chinese journalists they should “love the party, protect the party, and closely align themselves with the party leadership in thought, politics and action”. The intensifying clampdown has brought signs of resistance. In March Chinese security officials launched a manhunt apparently intended to track down the author of an anonymous online letter that had called for Xi’s resignation. Kerry Brown, the author of a new book about Xi called CEO, China, said he saw the crackdown as part of a decade-long Communist party struggle to stamp out those questioning its rule, such as civil rights lawyers and dissidents. “It is part of a war. Xi Jinping has been tougher at fighting that war largely because the party has become, I think, more spooked by the effectiveness of some of its opponents,” he said. Brown said he believed the entire party leadership backed the current offensive. “I think the party leadership at the top may disagree on many things that we don’t know about. But I’m pretty sure they agree on one thing and that is that without the party, they and the whole mission of [helping] China to become this great nation for the first time in modern history will go out of the window. “I think they really, profoundly believe that. They think the party is the thing that is going to get them there and they must defend it.”",REAL
Frenchman takes former employer to tribunal over tedious job,"A Frenchman who claims he was given so little to do at work he suffered “bore out” is taking his case to an employment tribunal on Monday. Frédéric Desnard says his managerial job at the perfume company, which made him redundant 18 months ago, was so tedious he became exhausted and literally bored out of his mind. The 44-year-old said his “descent into hell” was similar to a burnout, but less interesting. In what is believed to be the first case of its kind in France, Desnard is seeking €360,000 (£282,000) in compensation and damages – including holiday pay, he says, is due. French press reporting his claims have taken the unusual step of using the English term “bore out” to describe what Desnard, who lives in Paris, claims to have suffered. Desnard complained that between 2010 and 2014 he was mis au placard, or put in the cupboard by his then employer Interparfums, a French phrase that involves giving employees little or no work, or menial tasks. He told Agence France-Presse he was relegated to doing tasks that had nothing to do with his job and deprived of his original responsibilities. This, he alleges, left him “destroyed” and with “serious depression”. “I was ashamed of being paid for doing nothing,” he said. Desnard claimed the stress and lack of stimulation at work triggered an epileptic fit when he was driving. He was signed off work for seven months before being made redundant in September 2014 for “prolonged absence” that had “disturbed the smooth working” of the company. Jean-Philippe Benissan, Interparfums’ lawyer, remarked that Desnard “never said anything about being bored” during his time with the firm and alleged he had first complained of burnout. “If he had nothing to do for four years, why did the company keep him on,” Benissan asked. In December 2015, a court ordered Desnard to pay his former employer €1,000 for defamation. The court judged he was “inspired by a sense of personal animosity” against his former employer who he had become convinced, without any real proof, had “ruined his health”. • This article was amended on 4 May 2016 to correct the phrase “mis au placard”.",REAL
Alex Lowe: mountain maverick who died on a typically audacious mission,"He was regarded as one of the greatest mountaineers of the modern era, lost in an ice avalanche on Shishapangma, in Tibet, 16 years ago. Now the body of the American climber Alex Lowe, aged 40 when he died, has finally been found along with that of his climbing companion, 29-year old cameraman David Bridges, also American. Fittingly perhaps, the bodies were discovered by the Swiss mountaineer Ueli Steck – regarded as one of the the world’s best current mountaineers – and his companion David Goettler, while acclimatising for an attempt on the south face of the 8,031metre-high (26,350ft) Shishapangma. The find brings closure to the lingering tragedy of their deaths on the world’s 14th highest mountain. Lowe and Bridges had been on the mountain as part of nine-person team when they got lost on a 1999 expedition, which planned to first climb Shishapangma and then descend it on skis, in what they hoped would be the first US ski descent of an 8,000m peak. The two were buried and killed when an ice cliff collapsed above them as they crossed a glacier, with a third companion, Conrad Anker – whose exploits were documented in the recent film Meru – surviving. Anker suffered broken ribs and a dislocated shoulder. At the time of his death Lowe was regarded as one on the best in his field – not least for his extraordinary physiological gifts at altitude, which earned him the nickname the “Lung on Legs” and “the Mutant”. As the writer and climber Jim Perrin noted in his obituary for the Guardian, Lowe was not only supremely physically gifted, with a slew of hard ascents under his belt, but also an early adopter of using the internet to publicise his climbs. “One significant factor in Lowe’s rise to worldwide fame,” wrote Perrin, “was his mastery of the internet technology that has allowed certain kinds of climbs to be photographed and marketed. “Climbing has thus become interesting to a broader segment of the population, and some companies unconnected with the activity are using it as part of their marketing images.” Lowe, from Bozeman, Montana, had made difficult climbs all over the world, including Nepal’s Kwangde and Kusum Kanguru, and twice reached the summit of Mount Everest. In Peru, he climbed the south-west buttress of Taulliraju. Familiar with the risks of high-end mountaineering, he had been involved in the high-profile rescue of a group of trapped Spanish climbers on Denali, the highest peak in the US, four years before his death, carrying the stricken climbers on his back during the rescue. Lowe, as Perrin wrote, downplayed his role. “It was one of those things you do because you have to do it, one of those Herculean things where you get a lot of adrenaline going and you just do it.” Confirmation of the discovery of Lowe and Bridges, came in a statement from Lowe’s widow, Jennifer, now married to his friend Anker. She said Steck and Gottlieb had discovered the remains of two people in a partially melted glacier and described the details of their clothing and backpacks to her. “Alex and David vanished, were captured and frozen in time. Sixteen years of life has been lived and now they are found. We are thankful,” Jenni Lowe-Anker said. In the last paragraph of her memoir, Forget Me Not, Lowe-Anker had predicted a day would come when her former husband’s body would be found. “Alex will melt out of the glacier one day … and I do not look forward to it.” In the statement, released by the charitable foundation founded in Lowe’s name, she added: “Alex’s parents are thankful to know that their son’s body has been found and that Conrad, the boys and I will make our pilgrimage to Shishapangma. It is time to put Alex to rest.” Anker also said the discovery has brought closure and relief to him. He told Outside magazine that although he had not seen photos of the remains, he was convinced they are those of Lowe and Bridges. “They were close to each other. Blue and red North Face backpacks. Yellow Koflach [mountaineering] boots. It was all that gear from that time period. They were pretty much the only two climbers who were there.” Bridges, 29, of Aspen, Colorado, was an accomplished high-altitude climber and cinematographer.",REAL
5 May: your guide to this week's local and mayoral elections,"The biggest set of elections, outside of a general election, for some time will be held on 5 May in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Polling stations are open between 7am and 10pm. You can find more information on how to vote here. Here’s a breakdown of what you need to know: English local government and mayoral elections Elections are being held at 124 councils in England, covering 2,743 seats. Some pollsters have predicted a wipeout for Labour, forecasting major losses across the country. This set of council seats was last contested in the wake of George Osborne’s 2012 “omnishambles” budget and saw Labour make significant gains under Ed Miliband, adding more than 500 councillors. There will also be mayoral elections in Bristol, Liverpool and Salford. The mayor of London and London Assembly The mayor of London contest has come down to a Labour v Conservative battle once again, with Labour’s Sadiq Khan favourite to beat the Tories’ Zac Goldsmith. Meanwhile, there are 25 London assembly seats up for grabs – 14 from constituencies and 11 London-wide. It is the role of the assembly to hold the mayor to account. Scottish parliament Scottish parliamentary elections use an additional member system to elect 129 members of the Scottish parliament (MSPs). Scotland is divided into 73 constituencies, each of which elects one MSP, and eight larger regions which elect seven MSPs each. The Scottish National party is expected to claim a resounding victory, although some polling experts have raised doubts over whether they will win as many seats as they did in 2011. Scottish Labour, led by Kezia Dugdale, is battling the Tories to be the official opposition in Holyrood. National assembly of Wales Welsh assembly elections also use the additional member system to elect 60 assembly members (AMs). Wales is divided into 40 constituencies, each of which elects one AM, and five larger regions which elect four AMs each. Labour is set to retain the greatest support in the assembly, although its numbers are expected to dip slightly on the previous election. Nationalists Plaid Cymru are forecast to solidify their position as the second party, while Conservatives are expected to come in third. Northern Ireland assembly Northern Ireland assembly elections use a system called single transferable vote to elect members of the legislative assembly (MLAs). There are 108 MLAs representing 18 constituencies. Each constituency is represented by six MLAs. Voters are given a ballot paper listing all the candidates competing for the six seats and have to rank them in order of preference. The last assembly election was held in 2011, with the DUP and Sinn Féin remaining the two largest parties and few have predicted major changes. Police and crime commissioners Police and crime commissioners (PCCs) were introduced by the Conservatives in 2012, and replaced the previous model of police authorities in England and Wales. They have powers to hire and fire chief constables and set police strategy and budgets, and can be politically-affiliated. The first PCC elections in 2012 saw low turnouts of between 10% and 20%. Elections are held in 40 police authorities. The Tories gained the most PCCs in 2012, with 16, followed by Labour on 13. As many as half of the PCCs elected in 2012 will not be seeking re-election, making predictions difficult.",REAL
Second refugee at Australian detention centre in Nauru sets herself on fire,"A young refugee woman from Somalia has set herself alight at an Australian detention centre on Nauru, just days after a 23-year-old man, Omid, died of injuries sustained in a similar act. It comes amid moves by the Australian immigration department to shift detainees out to other mainland facilities, a worsening mental health crisis in the offshore processing centres, and the sudden partial collapse of Australia’s offshore processing policy. Omid’s widow on Monday told Guardian Australia that she is being kept in a Brisbane hotel by immigration authorities, denied access to a lawyer and sedated. The name of the young woman who self-immolated on Monday is Hadon, sometimes also written as Hodan, and she is 21. Her suicide attempt on Monday afternoon, at OPC1 in the Nauru detention centre, has been confirmed by senior department staff. According to several sources on the island, she is severely burned, and is currently in the Nauruan hospital. An Australian medical team specialising in trauma treatment is reportedly on the island and treating the woman. “One of the witness who saw her said the situation is much worse than Omid,” said the source. Other refugees have been stopped from entering the hospital, but expressed concern that she be medically evacuated out soon after accusations of delays in treating Omid. A Careflight medical jet left Townsville shortly after 8.30pm bound for the Solomon Islands capital of Honiara, which the flights to Nauru must stop at first. However, Guardian Australia could not confirm this was definitely sent for Hodan. Hadon is one of three detainees returned to Nauru last week after receiving medical care in Australia for injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident late last year. Last Tuesday morning she was forcibly removed by Border Force officers from the Brisbane Immigration Transit Accommodation. The government of Nauru said it was “distressed that refugees are attempting such dreadful acts in order to attempt to influence the Australian Government’s immigration policies.” The past week has seen significant changes and events within Australia’s immigration regime. Current Australian government policy – with bipartisan support – states that no asylum seeker who attempts to arrive by boat will ever settle in the country. Instead they are sent to the two offshore processing facilities on Manus Island, in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and on Nauru. There they are processed and either repatriated or resettled in a third country. However after the PNG supreme court ruled the detention illegal, and its government announced closure of the Manus Island facility, the Australian government has scrambled for a solution . Detainees in both centres have become increasingly distressed amid the confusion. On Monday, authorities began a sudden transfer of detainees from a mainland detention centre in Darwin to other mainland facilities. Detainees, believed to be from both the family and single men’s compounds, were told to report to appointments with immigration on Monday morning. There, at least some were told they would be transferred to other mainland detention centres in the next few days. Detainees were given a luggage limit of one 20kg bag each for their possessions, and were to be transferred by charter flight. As well as housing a number of long-term detainees, Wickham Point is also used as a transfer facility between mainland and offshore centres, and as detention for people brought from offshore facilities to receive Australian medical treatment. The department of immigration did not respond to questions on the Wickham Point transfer. Catherine Stubberfield, spokesperson for UNHCR’s Regional Representation in Canberra, said there was “no doubt that the current policy of offshore processing and prolonged detention is immensely harmful”. “There are approximately 2000 very vulnerable refugees and asylum-seekers on Manus Island and Nauru. These people have already been through a great deal, many have fled war and persecution, some have already suffered trauma. Despite commendable efforts by the Governments of Papua New Guinea and Nauru, arrangements in both countries have proved completely untenable. Stubberfield said the mental health and physical wellbeing of people held in detention had deteriorated over time. “The consensus among medical experts is that conditions of detention and offshore processing do immense damage to physical and mental health. UNHCR’s principal concern today is that these refugees and asylum-seekers are immediately moved to humane conditions with adequate support and services to prevent further unnecessary suffering.” The UNHCR conducts regular monitoring visits to offshore detention sites, including seven visits to Nauru since it was re-opened in 2012. UNHCR staff were present when Omid set himself alight last Wednesday, though he had not been interviewed by the UNHCR or doctors accompanying the mission. Stubberfield said UNHCR staff were deeply saddened by Omid’s death. Save the Children’s chief executive Paul Ronalds said Australia needed to find permanent, and workable solutions, for those held on Nauru and Manus, who were being damaged by the ongoing uncertainty over their futures. “We know first-hand from our time on Nauru that prolonged and indefinite detention, and the uncertainty associated with a lack of permanent resettlement options for refugees on Nauru, causes serious harm. Recent events on both Manus and Nauru demonstrate the unsustainability of present arrangements, and that further serious and life threatening incidents are inevitable.” Greens senator, Sarah Hanson-Young, called for the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to intervene. “I refuse to accept that this is the best we can do. There are not just the two options of dangerous boat journeys or people burning themselves to death,” she said. “There is a better way, where we process people’s claims for asylum where they are and then bring them to Australia safely.”",REAL
Workers fight for dignity in Trump's Las Vegas hotel: 'You don't talk to the boss',"Maricella Olvera encounters Donald Trump on occasion, but she’s careful not to say a word. The 47-year-old cleans the penthouse at the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, where Trump, his family, and celebrity guests often come to stay. She cleans around them in silence. Trump is always uninterested. “The policy is: you don’t talk to the boss,” she said at her small one-bedroom home, on the joyously named Sing Song Way in the city’s northern suburbs. While Olvera may be silent at work, she and a collective of cleaners, bar workers, and kitchen staff at the Trump hotel have been a thorn in the billionaire’s side for the past year, using what voice they have to remind the public of the hypocrisy that surrounds his audacious run for the presidency and his record as an employer. Although Trump has touted himself as “the greatest jobs president that God has ever created”, these workers point to the fact they are paid on average $3 less than the thousands of unionised hotel workers in Las Vegas who work identical jobs and enjoy a host of other benefits, including pensions and free health insurance, not available to Trump employees. Earlier this month, following a protracted dispute with Trump and his co-owner, casino billionaire Phil Ruffin, the National Labor Relations Board officially certified a union for over 500 staff at the hotel. Workers argue they have been subjected to surveillance, intimidation, and unlawful dismissal as they have sought to organize. Hotel management has so far consistently rejected calls to sit down and negotiate a new contract and appear likely to appeal the certification. It is estimated by the Culinary Workers Union that 98% of casinos and hotels on the strip and in downtown Las Vegas are unionised, making the company’s stance a near total outlier. Meanwhile, the billionaire’s campaign filings reveal he values his stake in the hotel at $50m, with a generated income of more than $27m. Olvera left her impoverished hometown in Central Mexico in 1987. She trekked for three days on foot to cross the US border, eventually making it to Salinas, California, where she immediately started work on the fields. She picked broccoli, lettuce and berries for 14 hours a day, seven days a week. Only 14 years old, she started sending money back to her family straight away. Twenty-nine years on, Olvera is now a permanent resident of the US, with two sons about to graduate from medical school. Like almost 70% of unionised workers at the Trump hotel who are also immigrants, she worries about job insecurity while suffering the indignity of a boss running for president on an aggressive immigration platform that leaves the staff themselves feeling targeted. “He has said bad things,” she said stridently. “I know my people. My people work in the fields, my people [are] kitchen workers, my people [are] landscaping – honest people, working hard to make money. Nobody give you nothing for free.” The disdain reflects a broader consensus among Latino voters: Trump is likely to face the highest unfavorability rating among the demographic in history (close to 90%) if he secures the Republican nomination in July. “A lot of guests tell me, ‘I’m sorry for [what] Donald Trump said [to] your people,’” she said, regaining a smile. “I say, ‘It’s OK.’ I respect all minds.” Olvera was not at work when the National Labor Relations Board ruled against Trump. In January, she slipped and fell, severely injuring her knee, while cleaning a tall mirror in one of the luxury condos. She now walks with crutches, and survives on $49 a day in disability payment. The payment amounts to half of her actual compensation, $14.28 an hour. The Culinary Workers Union says she would receive full pay on a unionised contract. “My two sons pay [for] my car, my insurance, all my bills, my electricity, everything right now,” she said. She has stopped sending money back to Mexico for the first time in years. She worries about her mortgage repayments, but the more pressing concern is the surgery on her knee that will determine when she can return to work, and how much she will owe in medical bills. The hotel shimmers in the daylight; its windows are coated in 24-carat gold, which turns the natural light inside the bedrooms a sickly shade of green. At 64 storeys, it is one of the tallest buildings in Las Vegas and manages to distinguish itself in a city renowned for vulgarity. The lobby is heavily perfumed, with an overwhelming synthetic coconut smell. The Trump Store sells an extensive range of branded products, from Trump piggy banks and Trump cuddly toys to Trump champagne glasses and wine glasses. At the hotel’s poolside bar, H2 (Eau), Frank Sinatra croons on the stereo, Make America Great Again caps are stacked next to vintage bottles of bourbon, and a Trump quote is emblazoned on a large mirror: “As long as you’re going to be thinking anyway, think big.” David, a salesman from Brooklyn, sits on a stool drinking a gin and tonic and clutching a cigar. A Trump supporter and regular at the hotel, he describes it as “the best in Vegas”. “There’s no ding, ding, ding, like the casinos,” he says. “This is a classy place. Trump’s a classy guy.” The cleaning staff stay mostly invisible, using separate elevators and doorways to reach the immaculately kept rooms. Celia Vargas, a 57-year-old cleaner, has worked at the hotel full time for three years, earning $14 an hour. Now a US citizen, she fled civil war in El Salvador aged 23 and crossed the US southern border smuggled inside a small container on the back of a truck. “I have always felt very proud of my work,” she said at the home she shares with her daughter and seven grandchildren. “But I feel that for Mr Donald Trump, we don’t matter as workers or as human beings. For Mr Donald Trump, we’re just a number.” Her employment has been plagued with uncertain working hours, she said, meaning she can be paid as little as $350 a week. “My expenses often don’t match my budget, so I always end up owing more or having to get loans, or pawning or selling something of mine in order to get enough.” Vargas was diagnosed with breast cancer last June. Her insurance did not cover the full costs of treatment, leaving her in thousands of dollars in debt, and it would not pay for a full night in hospital for her to recover after surgery – her daughter came to fetch her two hours after the operation, and took her home while she was still drowsy from the anaesthesia. Trump hotel workers see up to $132 in health insurance payments deducted from their biweekly paychecks, according to the Culinary Workers Union, and should receive free and more comprehensive insurance if on a union contract. Vargas was forced to sell her own apartment two years ago after her husband, also a migrant from El Salvador, who worked a well paid job as a cook on the Las Vegas strip, was arrested following an alleged DUI incident and transferred to immigration detention. He has been detained for two and half years now, and moved all around the country. Vargas has not seen him since December last year, when she made the five-hour drive to visit him in Orange County, California. He would face certain deportation under Trump’s hardline immigration platform. Vargas was one of the first to organise the workforce, and says when they first started wearing small, pro-union badges, she was sacked along with six other colleagues, until the Culinary Workers Union intervened and got her employment reinstated. Another former employee, 47-year-old Rosebert Donato, had worked at the hotel for three years, earning $11.20 an hour as a linen attendant on the late shift. Donato was fired shortly after the vote to unionize in December last year and argued he was targeted because of his participation in the union. “They fired us like we were delinquents,” Vargas said. The Trump Organization, the holding company which owns Trump’s stake in the hotel, did not respond to a list of detailed questions despite multiple requests. Historically, union-busting has never been Trump’s style. He has long relied on unionised workforces to construct and staff his businesses in New York and New Jersey. In his 2000 book The America We Deserve, he wrote an impassioned defence of Jim Hoffa, president of one of America’s largest unions, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters: “Let me tell you this: Unions still have place in American society. In fact, with the globalization craze in full heat unions are about the only political force reminding us to remember the American family.” On the campaign trail, too, Trump has celebrated his lengthy list of union endorsements. “I have tremendous support within unions,” he said in February. “My support is really with those workers, those people … the policemen, the firemen, the construction workers, the lathers, the sheetrock workers, the electricians, the plumbers.” So why, in a city with such a rich history of trade unionism, in a swing state that Trump will hope to win if he secures the nomination, bother picking a fight he looks set to lose? Some with knowledge of the negotiations suggested it was Trump’s son Eric who had pushed the company’s unwavering stance. Others pointed to his carefully guarded image as a straight talking hardman that he was unlikely to relinquish for the duration of the presidential race. But perhaps the dispute best exemplifies Trump’s entirely unpredictable nature: his extraordinary ability to say one thing, and do something entirely different. At Vargas’s home, as dinner was about to be served, the results from the New York primary beamed in live on the TV. As Trump celebrated his landslide victory, he took to the lectern in Trump Tower. “We have problems everywhere you look,” he said. “We are going to solve those problems. And one of the big problems is the economy and jobs, and that is my wheelhouse.” Vargas shook her head in silence.",REAL
Paddy Ashdown slams government for refusing entry to Afghan interpreter,"Paddy Ashdown has accused the government of acting dishonourably in the case of an Afghan interpreter who reportedly killed himself while facing deportation from Britain. Nangyalai Dawoodzai is understood to have worked for the British army in Afghanistan for three years, before fleeing the country after receiving death threats from the Taliban. The 29-year-old, who paid people smugglers to reach the UK, was told his request for asylum in Britain had been rejected when it was found he had been fingerprinted in Italy on arrival in Europe, according to the Daily Mail. Under the EU’s Dublin regulation, aimed at preventing multiple asylum claims by individuals, Dawoodzai had to pursue his claim in the first country he applied in. Faced with being sent back to Italy to claim political asylum there he killed himself, a fellow translator told the newspaper. Lord Ashdown, who has championed the cause of Afghan war interpreters for years, said their treatment was scandalous. “It wrenches your heart out sideways. Here is a man who served in Helmand, probably on the frontline, who did it day in and day out for British troops, no going back home every six months, whose family were not tucked away safe but was in the community. “[He] then had to leave Afghanistan because of death threats and because we would not honour our commitment to him, and travels across half the world to get to us. Made the mistake of being fingerprinted in Italy and then struggles to get across the Channel, we don’t know how he did it, and is then going to get sent back. “As an act of shame in our nation dishonouring the service these people have given, I can’t think of a worse one,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme. In March, David Cameron told the House of Commons a set of conditions for Afghan interpreters to be given sanctuary in Britain had been agreed while in coalition with the Lib Dems. The PM said there was also a scheme in place for Afghans who want to help rebuild their war-ravaged country. According to the Mail, at least three other interpreters who served UK forces in war zones currently face deportation because they were fingerprinted in mainland Europe before arriving in the UK. The chairman of the Commons defence select committee, Julian Lewis, said he hoped the case would press UK authorities to take a “more generous and enlightened attitude” towards former interpreters, should Dawoodzai’s case be verified. He said: “Many people will share my bafflement and concern that we seem unable to get rid of people who mean us harm and unwilling to take people who have served us loyally.” Dawoodzai reportedly told a fellow former interpreter he worked with British soldiers based at Camp Bastion in Helmand province. He had been staying at a hostel in Birmingham when his application was rejected after the Italian records were found. He was reportedly arrested and held in a detention centre for 18 days. On release he returned to the hostel while his paperwork was processed. The interpreter told the newspaper: “He was depressed and very down. He said his life was at risk and no one cared … He believed that Britain would help him because he had helped them. Now he has killed himself – it is so desperate.” A Home Office spokesman said: “We are very saddened by this tragic case. As investigations are continuing, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.”",REAL
Concern over 'political' use of solitary confinement in European prisons,"European prisons are increasingly resorting to solitary confinement to counteract the threat of terrorism, despite warnings about its impact, defence lawyers and human rights advocates say. France, Belgium and the Netherlands are all deploying solitary and “small-group isolation” on suspected and convicted terrorists to prevent radicalisation of prisoners. In Belgium, about 35 people are placed on isolation measures, spending 23 hours a day in their cell and one hour in a small recreation yard, also alone. Four individuals are in solitary confinement on the recently opened de-radicalisation units in the country, with more expected to arrive in the future. In France, an unknown number of terrorism suspects are being in held in isolation blocks. Over the past year or so, France has also established several dedicated units for deradicalisation, but an apparent lack of rehabilitative or therapeutic programming means prisoners remain in their cells most of the day. In the Netherlands, where terrorist wings have nearly reached their capacity, men are being strip and cavity searched each time they have contact with a third party or go to court. “I’m very concerned about political pressures to isolate terrorists and to build special units to isolate them,” said Sharon Shalev, a research associate at Oxford University’s faculty of law and an expert on solitary confinement. “The public, our politicians, and our prison administrations, should keep a cool head,” she added. Despite the increase, the number of people held in solitary confinement in Europe is tiny compared with the US, where as many as 100,000 people are kept in segregated cells. That number sets the US apart from most of the rest of the world and exceeds the entire prison populations of countries such as the UK, France and Germany. Last week the Guardian reported on how the Obama administration is pressing individual states to join its mission to cut back on the use of solitary confinement in the US. Human rights lawyers point to the psychological and physical consequences of isolation, and say that its use may amount to torture or ill-treatment. Additional concerns have been expressed about the big rise in the use of small-group isolation in Europe, in which people are segregated from the general population, although not necessarily from each other. Prison isolation may not only be inhumane, but also ineffective. Critics say the practice may make people more vulnerable to extremist ideas, and stress that eliminating communication among prisoners is often impossible. Solitary is not new to Europe nor is it used exclusively for terrorists. Yet the Charlie Hebdo attacks of January 2015 – where at least two of the gunmen were said to have been “radicalised” on the inside – left Europeans fearful, angry and hungry for action. Almost immediately, officials and prison administrations identified isolation as a key tool in preventing future violence. An internal memo issued by the director general of the Belgian prison service in the months after Charlie Hebdo stressed the importance of taking action to stem the spread of radicalisation. The memo said: “Every prisoner who is incarcerated for terrorist acts must be placed immediately under MSPI” – an isolation status that can last for a month. Nicolas Cohen is a lawyer who has represented terrorism suspects and is also vice-president of the International Observatory of Prisons (OIP) in Belgium, which studies whether conditions comply with international norms and human rights laws. Cohen read from a psychiatric evaluation of one of his clients in isolation since last July, in which the prisoner is described as agitated and observed to be speaking to the walls. A majority of the men held in the 10-cell high-security unit in Bruges are terrorism suspects, according to Cohen. When a prisoner is placed in isolation in an ordinary jail, they can still hear sounds from the cells around them. “In Bruges there is no such noise and feeling,” Cohen said in an email. “You have to be handcuffed through a hole in the door before getting out.” The unit, known as the QMSPI, has been fiercely criticised by human rights groups in the past. A Belgian prison spokeswoman, Kathleen Van De Vijver, said there were protections in place for prisoners in isolation, including the requirement to renew their classification at regular intervals. She also said that prisoners received regular visits from doctors and psychiatrists, who could submit recommendations to prison authorities for ameliorated conditions, although Cohen said these were almost always denied. “They’re applying the strictest measures against them,” said Marie Cretenot, a French lawyer for OIP, when asked about the conditions on the inside for alleged terrorists, adding that long-term isolation could amount to inhumane and degrading treatment under article 3 of the European convention on human rights. The UN special rapporteur on torture, Juan Méndez, has called for an absolute ban on isolation in excess of 15 days. Lawyers in Belgium and France also said that people had been subject to sleep deprivation because of frequent nightly checks by guards. The French ministry of justice did not respond to requests for comment. André Seebregts, a defence lawyer, said the constant strip and cavity searches on the Netherlands’ two terrorist units were humiliating and counter-productive. “I do have some guys who go in there, not too angry at the Dutch government, and when they come out they’re a lot more negative.” Jaap Oosterveer, a press officer for the ministry of security and justice, said prisoners had exaggerated claims of mistreatment for political purposes. Isolation may, in any case, be futile. Charlie Hebdo attacker Amedy Coulibaly is said to have been radicalised by alleged al-Qaida recruiter Djamel Beghal while the two were in solitary confinement in a prison south of Paris. One of their cells was below the other, and they allegedly passed messages through their windows using drink bottles tied to sheets. Other countries have used different approaches to managing radicalisation. The UK disperses suspected and convicted terrorists across high-security facilities, a policy that some say prevents potentially dangerous friendships or hierarchies from forming. A pending government review into extremism in British prisons, however, may overhaul the approach to terrorist prisoners. Arun Kundnani examined counter-extremism policies in the US and the UK in his recent book, The Muslims are Coming. “The underlying assumption of most radicalization models is that terrorism is caused by ideology spreading like a virus from person to person,” he told the Guardian, adding that this was flawed. Others say governments should do more to address the social inequalities, and foreign policy decisions, that help shape people’s sense that violence is the answer. “They’re taking these measures which are just political posturing, and that are not very useful in the end,” Seebregts said of the security measures in Dutch prisons. “It’s just to show the people that they’re doing something.”",REAL
M​​oqtada al-Sadr: who is the cleric directing Iraq's protests?,"From a US and British perspective, the most pressing issue in Iraq is defeating Islamic State. For Iraqi citizens, however, it is the ongoing abject failure of the prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, and his government to provide basic public services, create jobs, and root out corruption among the country’s kleptocratic political class. Into this gap between external strategic perception and domestic political reality has stepped Moqtada al-Sadr, the charismatic Shia cleric and former Mahdi army leader whose virulent sectarianism and violent resistance to the US occupation earned him notoriety in the west and hero status among many Iraqi Shias between 2004 and 2008. The street protest movement that has rocked Baghdad in recent weeks, culminating in the weekend invasion of the walled government, parliament and embassy enclave known as the green zone, is largely directed by Sadr, who has moved his centre of operations from the holy city of Najaf to the capital. Some demonstrations have drawn up to 200,000 people. No longer the sectarian firebrand and anti-US insurgent, Sadr has recast himself as a man of all the people, a fervent Iraqi nationalist and federalist who upholds the democratic process by non-violent means. The Mahdi army militia was disbanded in 2008. In the 2014 elections, the Sadrist al-Ahrar bloc won 34 seats in parliament. In short, Sadr has gone legit. Far from seeking Abadi’s overthrow, Sadr says he wants to help him implement reforms, in particular to end the discredited quota system introduced by Washington after the 2003 invasion. Quotas were intended to ensure Iraq’s main ethno-religious constituencies – Shias, Sunnis and Kurds – shared power, but they have been widely abused to enrich office-holders and extend party political patronage. Abadi, though personally popular, is widely seen as weak – and his divided, faction-riven administration even weaker. The territorial sweep Isis made in 2014 and the contempt for Baghdad’s writ shown by southern Shia tribal chiefs and northern Kurdish separatists have led some analysts to suggest the centre cannot hold. Sadr’s claim to be on Abadi’s side while his tactics further undermine the prime minister’s authority could prove fatal. Abadi’s departure would be a big problem for Washington, which spent months trying to unseat his predecessor, Nouri al-Maliki, largely because he was seen as pursuing a sectarian Shia agenda. Abadi is their man and last week Joe Biden, the US vice-president, was briefly in Baghdad, supposedly stiffening backbones and refocusing attention on Isis. His efforts do not appear to have succeeded. Washington and its western allies worry, with good reason, that the unrest, coupled with political inertia and cash-flow problems exacerbated by global oil price falls, is undermining their key aim of defeating Isis. Army units reportedly recalled to help with security in Baghdad had been intended for use in the expected campaign to expel Isis from Mosul, Iraq’s second city. Last week Barack Obama expressed surprising optimism that Mosul would fall by the end of the year, a claim that suggested how out of touch Washington may have become. The contrary story on the ground is that the Iraqi army, far from being on the point of storming Mosul, is under-resourced and once again suffering desertions and low morale. Sadr has a dog in the Isis fight, too. His so-called Peace Companies, armed militia that are the successors to the Mahdi army, have fought against Isis alongside the government-sanctioned, Shia-centric Popular Mobilisation Forces, known locally as as al-Hashd al-Shaabi . These forces, more than the Iraqi army, are praised for recent successes against the jihadis. Sadr also uses his militia to protect Shia holy sites, further raising his public profile. Sadr’s re-emergence as a powerful national leader may have some advantages for Washington. Despite three years spent in voluntary exile in Iran, his newly minted nationalist stance makes him a potential bulwark against Tehran’s influence, which has become all-pervasive since the US left. There are sharp tensions between Sadr and rival Shia factions, and Sadrist militia have clashed with the Iranian-backed Hashd. Sadr enjoys the sort of grassroots support that few if any other Iraqi politicians currently command. This does not include the Sunni minority, whose rejection of any Shia-dominated central authority looks likely to continue. If Abadi is deposed, however, they and Washington may have little choice but to deal with a former hate figure once dubbed the “most dangerous man in Iraq”.",REAL
Australia Post to charge up to $9 for delay in collecting packages,"Australia Post will slug customers up to $9 for delaying to collect their packages from a post office, the company announced on Monday. Currently, missed deliveries are held by a post office for 10 days free of charge, then returned to sender. From 1 August, packages will be held for free for five business days, and cost $3 to collect after six to 10 business days; $6 after 11 to 15 business days; and $9 for 16 to 30 days. Australia Post said the changes were about “giving customers more time to collect their parcels” and that 92% of customers collected their parcels within five days anyway, avoiding any fee. “We believe this service will help the small amount of customers who can’t collect their parcel straight away,” a spokeswoman said. Packages belonging to MyPost customers will continue to be held for free for 10 days. The Communication Workers Union has described the new charges as a “gouge”. “We’re concerned that the community is being gouged for more money when already their letters have doubled in price and halved in the quality of service, so we’re very concerned about it,” the CWU’s Joan Doyle told the ABC. “We think it’s outrageous that they’ve introduced fees for people to pick up their parcels and we foresee that there will be a lot of fights about whether people got a card in the first place, whether they were at home when the postie or the parcel driver went past, and how long the parcel has been waiting.” The company upped the price of stamps in January from 70c to $1 as it seeks to recover from a $222m loss last year. It announced in April it had completed a so-called digital transformation, to ensure the company’s profitability as letter volumes decline, including the use of delivery drones.",REAL
"Solitary confinement is 'no touch' torture, and it must be abolished","Shortly after arriving at a makeshift military jail, at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, in May 2010, I was placed into the black hole of solitary confinement for the first time. Within two weeks, I was contemplating suicide. After a month on suicide watch, I was transferred back to US, to a tiny 6 x 8ft (roughly 2 x 2.5 meter) cell in a place that will haunt me for the rest of my life: the US Marine Corps Brig in Quantico, Virginia. I was held there for roughly nine months as a “prevention of injury” prisoner, a designation the Marine Corps and the Navy used to place me in highly restrictive solitary conditions without a psychiatrist’s approval. For 17 hours a day, I sat directly in front of at least two Marine Corps guards seated behind a one-way mirror. I was not allowed to lay down. I was not allowed to lean my back against the cell wall. I was not allowed to exercise. Sometimes, to keep from going crazy, I would stand up, walk around, or dance, as “dancing” was not considered exercise by the Marine Corps. To pass the time, I counted the hundreds of holes between the steel bars in a grid pattern at the front of my empty cell. My eyes traced the gaps between the bricks on the wall. I looked at the rough patterns and stains on the concrete floor – including one that looked like a caricature grey alien, with large black eyes and no mouth, that was popular in the 1990s. I could hear the “drip drop drip” of a leaky pipe somewhere down the hall. I listened to the faint buzz of the fluorescent lights. For brief periods, every other day or so, I was escorted by a team of at least three guards to an empty basketball court-sized area. There, I was shackled and walked around in circles or figure-eights for 20 minutes. I was not allowed to stand still, otherwise they would take me back to my cell. I was only allowed a couple of hours of visitation each month to see my friends, family and lawyers, through a thick glass partition in a tiny 4 x 6ft room. My hands and feet were shackled the entire time. Federal agents installed recording equipment specifically to monitor my conversations, except with my lawyers. The United Nations special rapporteur on torture, Juan Mendez, condemned my treatment as “cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment”, describing “the excessive and prolonged isolation” I was placed under for that period of time. However, he didn’t stop there. In a preface to the 2014 Spanish edition of the Sourcebook on Solitary Confinement, written by Méndez he strongly recommends against any use of solitary confinement beyond 15 days. As Mendez explains: Prolonged solitary confinement raises special concerns, because the risk of grave and irreparable harm to the detained person increases with the length of isolation and the uncertainty regarding its duration. In my public declarations on this theme, I have defined prolonged solitary confinement as any period in excess of 15 days. This definition reflects the fact that most of the scientific literature shows that, after 15 days, certain changes in brain functions occur and the harmful psychological effects of isolation can become irreversible. Unfortunately, conditions similar to the ones I experienced in 2010-11 are hardly unusual for the estimated 80,000 to 100,000 inmates held in these conditions across the US every day. In the time since my confinement at Quantico, public awareness of solitary confinement has improved by orders of magnitude. People all across the political spectrum – including some who have never been in solitary or known anyone who has – are now beginning to question whether this practice is a moral and ethical one. In June 2015, US supreme court justice Anthony Kennedy called the prison system “overlooked” and “misunderstood”, stating that he welcomes a case that would allow the court to review whether or not solitary confinement is cruel and unusual under the US constitution. The evidence is overwhelming that it should be deemed as such: solitary confinement in the US is arbitrary, abused and unnecessary in many situations. It is cruel, degrading and inhumane, and is effectively a “no touch” torture. We should end the practice quickly and completely.",REAL
Corbyn ally Len McCluskey attacks ‘treacherous’ Labour MPs,"A key ally of Jeremy Corbyn has accused MPs of employing treacherous tactics designed to undermine Labour’s leader, as an analysis of the latest polls by a leading academic suggests the party is on course for its worst local election results for 35 years. Len McCluskey, the head of the UK’s biggest union, Unite, claimed former shadow ministers Liz Kendall and Michael Dugher, Gordon Brown’s former aide Ian Austin and newly elected MP Wes Streeting have made interventions meant to damage Corbyn. McCluskey’s intervention comes as a new projection conducted for the Guardian shows that Labour is on course to lose 175 council seats in Thursday’s elections . Such a result would be the worst local election performance in opposition since 1982 when voting took place against the background of the Falklands war. Labour’s performance in the first nationwide electoral test since Corbyn won the party leadership with an overwhelming majority last year is seen in Westminster as a day of reckoning. The decision by McCluskey, the head of the the party’s main financial backer, to escalate the party’s row by naming names follows weeks of frustration over attacks by the party’s MPs on Corbyn. It will be seen as a shot across the bows of some of Corbyn’s harshest critics to ensure there is not a leadership challenge after Thursday’s results come through. Both McCluskey and Labour MP Diane Abbott, a longstanding Corbyn supporter, claimed on Sunday that the damaging row over antisemitism, sparked by Ken Livingstone’s controversial comments last week, is being manipulated for political ends. In an interview with the Guardian, McCluskey said that some MPs had been “nothing short of treacherous” and set “stupid traps” for Corbyn and his supporters by claiming the party should win a certain number of seats. “We have had Michael Dugher saying Jeremy has 99 days to prove himself and suddenly 5 May becomes a litmus test on Corbyn’s ability to lead the party. “We have had Liz Kendall saying we should win 400 council seats. This is the woman who got 4.5% of the vote in the leadership election. We won’t be taking lectures off people like that who are interested in setting false traps,” he said. McCluskey said two other MPs instigated an internal party row last month after protesting that the fast food chain McDonald’s had been banned from sponsoring a stall at Labour’s conference. “People like Wes Streeting and Ian Austin going on about McDonald’s ... It is laughable. [McDonald’s] is viciously anti-trade union and is attacking the bakers’ union and has been ripping off young kids with zero-hours contracts. And suddenly we have Labour MPs coming to their rescue. It is not about McDonald’s – it is about attacking Jeremy Corbyn,” he said. McCluskey predicted the party would lose seats in Scotland and Wales but said that such results should not spark any moves from within the party against Corbyn. “[Corbyn’s team] have to be given time to get their message beyond the media who attack them every single day aided and abetted by a bunch of Labour MPs. It is as if they wake up every day and think ‘What stick can we beat Jeremy Corbyn with today?’” he said. McCluskey claimed that Austin should face disciplinary procedures for showing “disrespect” to Corbyn after Austin, the MP for Dudley North, had reportedly confronted Corbyn at a recent parliamentary Labour party meeting. “Some of the individuals, including Ian Austin, are behaving despicably. Should that sort of disrespect be dealt with? I think it should, by the chief whip,” he said. McCluskey was interviewed on Wednesday – after Labour MP Naz Shah apologised to parliament for writing that Israel could be moved to the US, but before Livingstone made remarks appearing to claim that Adolf Hitler was a supporter of Zionism. Austin said McCluskey’s attack was “really unfair”. “I am very surprised that the leader of a union I have been a member of for 30 years would say something like this without contacting me. “We are working really hard for these elections and everyone else should too,” he said. Dugher said: “I am not apologising for standing against antisemitism and for urging the leadership to do more which eventually they did. “Its not a ‘stupid test’ to say that the Labour party must show that we are capable of ever winning a general election. Too many of Len’s members can’t afford endless Conservative governments.” In response, Kendall said the party should this week show “clear evidence” that it can win in 2020 and maintained that the party should be aiming to win 400 council seats. “The people we came into politics to serve rely on us to deliver Labour councils and a realistic prospect of winning in 2020,” she said. Streeting did not respond to a request for a comment. Using the average of the latest opinion poll results, including the Opinium/Observer poll carried out after the antisemitism row last week, Steve Fisher, of Oxford University, one of the country’s leading elections experts, predicts that Labour could be on course for losses of 175 local council seats, while the Conservatives could gain 30. On the national equivalent vote share, which tends to be a good predictor of subsequent general elections, Labour looks likely to be one percentage point behind the Conservatives, Fisher calculates – on a par with 2011. That compares to the six-point lead achieved by Ed Miliband in the 2012 local elections; and approximately 15 points needed for a majority at a general election. Labour MPs will also be watching the party’s performance in the Scottish parliament in Holyrood, and the Welsh assembly, closely. Some polls suggested Labour could even slip into third place in Scotland, behind a reinvigorated Conservative party led by the popular Ruth Davidson. Corbyn, who on Monday said that he and the party “stand absolutely against racism in any form”, has been requested by his Welsh colleagues not to visit the country amid fears that his intervention would not be helpful in a hard-fought contest, with Ukip keen to pick up seats. He has deliberately shifted his party to the left, basing its appeal on a strong anti-austerity message, which plays well in Labour heartlands. But if the party is to win a general election in 2020, it will also need to appeal to swing voters in traditionally Conservative areas. Council elections are notoriously difficult to predict, and Fisher points out that Labour could yet make some gains – or even worse losses than his central projection, based on the Conservatives’ average poll lead of 3.8 percentage points, suggests. But as well as the number of seats won or lost, Corbyn’s critics in parliament will also be closely watching the party’s performance in bellwether councils such as Crawley, where it currently has 19 seats against the Tories’ 18. The Liberal Democrats could be set to win up to 90 local council seats this week, the new projections suggest, as they seek to rebuild their shattered power-base following the collapse of their share of the vote after they joined the coalition government in 2010. At a May Day rally on Sunday, Corbyn insisted that Labour is “united” in opposing antisemitism. He has announced an independent review and pledged to tighten party codes of conduct in a bid to put a lid on the row – which has seen Shah and Livingstone suspended. Corbyn has received warnings – including from the London mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan - that the party would be punished in the 5 May elections. Opponents have accused him of acting too slowly to deal with incidents, most notably Livingstone’s incendiary assertion that Hitler was a supporter of Zionism before he “went mad and ended up killing six million Jews”.",REAL
'There was nobody to help me stop my son joining Isis',"Scrolling through photos on her mobile phone, Saliha Ben Ali stops at a picture of her son, Sabri, as a three-year-old sitting on Father Christmas’s lap. Santa’s white-gloved hands envelope Sabri’s small torso and that of the little boy sitting to his right. Both lads stare straight ahead, looking slightly bewildered. “To think, they were the only guys who were scared of Santa Claus that day,” Ben Ali recalls. “Now both of them are dead.” Sabri died in Syria aged 19, fighting for Isis, sometime between August 2013 and 8 December that year, when an unknown man telephoned Ben Ali’s husband to tell them he had been killed. She is still haunted by the 10-second phone call in which the man said “congratulations, your son is a martyr”. Bilal, the boy with whom Sabri shared Santa’s lap as a toddler and later went to school with him in Brussels, died in Paris on 13 November 2015. He was the jihadi who detonated a suicide bomb outside the Stade de France football stadium during the murderous night of attacks. “I was stunned when Sabri did what he did,” Ben Ali says. “I saw the signs before he went that something was wrong, that he was being manipulated, but there was nobody to help me. Then when I saw what Bilal did, I simply could not believe it.” Bilal’s mother, Fatima Hadfi, has described her 20-year-old son as having had the temperament of “a ticking timebomb” in the weeks before he blew himself up. But she was as unsure as Ben Ali as to where she might turn for help. “The first she knew of what her son had done was when she saw his image on her television screen two days after the attack,” Ben Ali says. The 44-year-old Belgian social worker – “even with a job like that I couldn’t save him”, she says – is sitting in a workshop on family-based intervention in Berlin, which is an introduction to her becoming a family counsellor to help others whose relatives have been drawn into the jihadi radicalisation process, to try to win them back. “Deradicalisation is a very underestimated part of counter-terrorism,” says Daniel Köhler, who is running the course. One of just a handful of experts in the field anywhere in the world, he founded and directs the German Institute on Radicalisation and Deradicalisation Studies (Girds) in Berlin. “Family counselling is one of the most effective tools … nothing is a stronger source for creating a living counter-narrative to radical ideals than the deep attachments and emotions harnessed in a family. Even jihadi recruiters are unable to touch that.” His pioneering approach, built on years of experience working on countering far-right extremism in Germany, is often described as a soft method. How favourably it is viewed by policymakers at any given time depends on current events, Köhler says. After high-profile attacks, such as those in Paris and Brussels, accusations abound that deradicalisation programmes do not work and governments and the public move towards more repressive measures, he explains. Köhler says there is no concrete way of measuring the success of his approach but he knows first-hand just how much call for the methods there is. He recently helped establish a nationwide counselling programme in the Netherlands, and was struck by the demand there was for the network even before it was up and running. “Even as it was being set up, the team was dealing with very relevant high-security cases, there was just no time to waste,” he says. Köhler describes his organisation as a bridge between families at risk and a whole network of social workers, teachers and security agencies, “a neutral, reliable agent that the family can contact at any time, that can give them the tools to recognise radicalisation and react to it, without feeling they’re in the role of snitches”. He says he will inform security services in high-risk cases, often when the family requests it, but believes prevention and intervention have a vital role to play in counter-terrorism. At the workshop in a communist-era prefab in Berlin, Ben Ali shares her experiences with two other mothers. Christianne Boudreau’s son Damian Clairmont, 22, left his native Canada for Syria to fight alongside Isis in late 2012. She heard of his death via Twitter in January 2014. Karolina Dam, a New Zealand-born Danish citizen, lost her 18-year-old son Lukas a year ago when he was killed in the Syrian border town of Kobani during a US-led coalition airstrike. The women, who formed Mothers for Life, a network of mothers who have lost their children to jihadi battle groups, now counsel other families who want help to bring their relatives back from the brink, adamant that no other parent should go through what they have. Köhler outlines the importance of taking a tailor-made approach to each case, invariably involving a young person who is in the process of being recruited by a jihadi group. He has repeatedly seen how such groups try to create conflict within a family of someone they are targeting. He gives an example of a family he helped, where the son, a convert to Islam, was showing increasing signs that he was being radicalised and repeatedly sought to provoke his family and create conflict. “The son came home one day to find his mum drinking a glass of wine and listening to Mozart. Concerned about her chances of entering paradise, he told her she’d burn in hell for that,” Köhler recalls. The son went back to the jihadi group and recounted the incident, to be told that his mother was an infidel who would never understand his faith. “Suddenly, the mother drinking wine, in the context of the jihadi struggle for good versus evil, is put on a par with the US bombing Iraq, and over time the group managed to distance the son completely from his family.” Ben Ali can immediately relate to his account. “This is exactly what they did with us,” she tells the group. “They used the fact that I am Shia to drive a wedge between us. My son would say to me: ‘Please, Mum, don’t pray like that anymore.’ I’d say: ‘Like what?’. ‘Like Shia.’ When he went to Syria the first call I got from him was him saying: ‘Mama, please don’t stay Shia. They are not proper Muslim.’ I assured him I would find my own way to Jannah [paradise], but that I would stay Shia.” Köhler talks of the importance of families looking for a mediator, such as an Imam within the community to whom they can turn. But in a poignant moment, Ben Ali speaks out. “It’s easy to say, but it’s not easy to do. I looked for an Imam in Belgium who would mediate between me and my son, but they just said to me: ‘What are you worried about? He wants to go and help his Muslim brothers. He’s practising Islam like we all should be doing.’” If she knew then what she knows now, she would have “locked him in a room to keep him safe”, she says. In cases of people who have left to join jihadis in Syria or elsewhere, the chances of getting them back are slim, Köhler says. “Maybe 5%.” So the key is to stop them going in the first place. He recalls “night-time conversations with mothers and sisters calling to say a son is on Skype from Syria, his father is talking to him in the next room, and our job is to try to keep him chatting”. Köhler says the longer the dialogue can be kept up – talking about the family pet, fond memories of family life – the higher the chance is to save them. Much of Köhler’s work is done on a pro bono basis, with the counselling often done online, mainly from his Berlin bedsit, at all hours of the day and night. Funding is tight and he is constantly being asked by government agencies from the UK to the US, who invite him to outline his methods, to justify the value of what he does. “It’s so plain to me that the key to a lot of counter-terrorism lies within the circle of family and friends,” he says. To back this up he cites recent research showing that even in cases of terrorists who are believed to have carried out operations alone, family and friends were in the know about their intentions to commit the act almost three-quarters of the time. Ben Ali is still not convinced she could have stopped her son, but she does feel empowered by the idea that she may be able to help prevent someone else’s family from being torn apart. “That’s so important to me,” she says, glancing on her phone screen at a black and white portrait of herself and Sabri. “Although I’m not naive enough to think we’re not going to lose lots more of our boys and girls.”",REAL
CIA 'live tweets' Osama bin Laden raid to mark five-year anniversary,"The Central Intelligence Agency’s decision to live-tweet the military operation that culminated in the death of Osama bin Laden “as if it were happening today” has been criticised as a distasteful “victory lap” and PR exercise. Osama bin Laden was killed on 2 May 2011 after a raid on his compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan by United States Navy Seal commandos. The series of tweets – complete with diagrams of the compound that the al-Qaida leader was killed in – marked five years since “Operation Neptune Spear”. The CIA announced to its 1.33m followers on Twitter that it would be tweeting the raid on Sunday using the hashtag #UBLRaid. In a preamble, the CIA praised the success of the mission as the “culmination of years of complex, thorough and highly advanced intel ops &amp; analyses led by CIA w support of [intelligence community].” “Death of Usama Bin Ladin [sic] marked significant victory in US-led campaign to disrupt, dismantle, &amp; defeat al-Qaida,” it went on. It also detailed the compound in which Bin Laden was found, and the features that led to its discovery including “trash burned not collected”. From 1:25pm EDT, the CIA began live-tweeting the raid, blow-by-blow as it played out in 2011, starting with the operation being approved by US president Barack Obama, CIA director Leon Panetta and vice admiral William H. McRaven of the Joint Special Operations Command. The series of tweets took in the helicopter raid and its fallout, as well as the the mission on the ground. The tweet announcing the death of “Usama Bin Ladin” had been retweeted 2,400 times and favourited 1,700 times at time of writing. The series concluded with praise of the “daring ... team effort”, linking to a “featured story” wrap and a more detailed timeline on the CIA’s website. The series was met with a mix of flippant jokes – including the omnipresent “Michael Jordan crying” meme – and criticism. Many more Twitter users questioned the thinking behind the stunt. The Daily Show asked the CIA to “stop it”. A spokesman defended the tweets in a statement to the ABC in the US, noting that it was not the first time the CIA had marked historical events on social media. “The takedown of bin Laden stands as one of the great intelligence successes of all time. History has been a key element of CIA’s social media efforts,” CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani said. “On the fifth anniversary, it is appropriate to remember the day and honor all those who had a hand in this achievement.” However, not everyone is convinced by the CIA’s official account of the Bin Laden operation. Seymour Hersh, the Pulitzer-prize winning investigative journalist renowned for breaking the My Lai and Abu Ghraib stories, says the claim that Bin Laden was tracked down by painstaking surveillance is a fiction constructed by the Obama administration. Instead, Hersh claims Bin Laden was given up by a rogue Pakistani official in exchange for the multimillion-dollar reward. He also cast doubt on the claim by US officials that Bin Laden died in a firefight, one of the parts of the story that White House spokesman, Jay Carney, later admitted had not been accurate.",REAL
Freediving world record set by William Trubridge with 122m dive,"A freediver has set a new world record - plunging 122m into a blue hole in the Bahamas on one breath. New Zealander William Trubridge set his 16th world mark, beating his own record of 121 metres. The latest dive saw him hold his breath for four minutes and 24 seconds. In a video posted by Trubridge’s diving company Vertical Blue, Trubridge said the dive was “pretty difficult”. “I had a beautiful descent, everything went well with the descent,” he said. At the bottom of the descent, Trubridge ran into difficulties attaching a tag to his leg, and said his ascent to the surface was “terrible”. “At that point I was completely out of the headspace that I need to be in for a deep dive,” he said. “With my focus off, I was not in the right head space, not in the place I like to be, to complete my dive with ease or confidence, in fact as I neared the surface I thought I might have a big black out at the top.” When Trubridge did surface, taking deep gulps of air, dozens of observers floating around his dive site fell silent- before breaking into rapturous applause. The dive was particularly special for Trubridge as his parents, David and Linda, and brother Sam had travelled to the Bahamas to witness his attempt. It was the first time Trubridge’s father had seen his son attempt a world record. “We lived on the ocean on a yacht for ten years, it was our home and for him the sea was his back garden, it was his playground,” said David Trubridge. “So it made sense for him to do this kind of thing.” Linda Trubridge said it was “the most wonderful thing” to see her son do what he does best. On his website Trubridge wrote that free diving was like being in an endless dream. “I have a relationship with the depths,” he wrote. “They beckon me beyond my means, cold, dark, vacant pressure, forever night, endless dreams.” Trubridge will attempt another world record in the Bahamas on Tuesday morning.",REAL
"New South Wales is Australia's strongest economy, Victoria a close second","New South Wales continues to be Australia’s strongest-performing economy while continued high unemployment has seen Western Australia slip again into sixth position, according to the latest CommSec State of the States report released on Monday. But the report says there is little difference between the top two states and between the bottom three. Victoria has gained “substantial ground” on NSW with strong housing finance, population growth, and the fastest annual economic growth rate in the nation. At the other end of the scale, the Tasmanian economy has improved enough to draw equal-last with South Australia after a modest lift in momentum driven by the low Australian dollar. The Tasmanian treasurer, Peter Gutwein, told Hobart paper the Mercury that he welcomed the slight improvement but there was still “a lot of work to do”. Western Australia, which had the strongest-performing economy in the October 2014 report, remains second-highest on construction work but second-lowest in business investment, population growth and housing finance. Population growth in particular has taken a dive: the end of the mining boom has seen it drop to 1.27%, down more than 50% on the decade average. The end of the boom has also seen WA ranked worst performer in terms of unemployment. The unemployment rate is 5.7% in trend terms, up from a decade-average of 4.4%. However, the report notes that at least part of WA’s low rank could be due to a change in the data used to measure economic growth, which is now measured just on state final demand figures. “No doubt if exports and imports were considered, Western Australia would have been among the strongest-growing economies rather than in fifth place (for economic growth),” the report notes. The State of the States report, released quarterly, rates states and territories across eight key measures: economic growth; retail spending; equipment investment; unemployment; construction work; population growth; housing finance; and dwelling starts. The Australian Capital Territory was in third place, driven by a 21.1% increase in equipment investment in the past 12 months and strong annual population growth. The Northern Territory ranked fourth, despite continuing to lead the economic growth and construction work indicators, due to placing last in population growth, business investment and housing finance. Queensland, which had the lowest national ranking on construction work and second-lowest on economic growth, ranked fifth. “The end of the construction phase of the mining boom is clearly evident in Western Australia and Queensland,” CommSec chief economist Craig James told AAP.",REAL

Hoverboard world record broken with 2km flight,"A Frenchman has flown more than 2 kilometers (over a mile) on a jet-powered hoverboard, setting an apparent new world record. The Guinness World Records reported on its website that 37-year-old Franky Zapata travelled 2.2km (7,388ft) off the French coastal town of Sausset-les-Pins on Saturday at a height of 50m (165ft) above the surface of the water. It said a Guinness World Records official was on hand for the flight and determined that it beat the previous record of 275.9m (905ft) by Canadian Catlin Alexandru Duru last year. After the successful flight, which was watched by more than 200 people, Zapata said: “This has really been a life’s work”. He said the feeling of hovering above the ground was “really peaceful”. “I open my arms because it helps me control my movements, but when you open your hands and you feel the wind go through your hand and you have nothing under your feet — it’s hard to describe, really. You have to experience this moment in your life.” Zapata, a jet ski champion, used a craft known as the Flyboard Air developed by his company Zapata Racing.

The Amish In America Commit Their Vote To Donald Trump; Mathematically Guaranteeing Him A Presidential Victory - ABC News,"18 SHARE The Amish in America have committed their vote to Donald Trump guaranteeing him the Presidency. (AP Photo / Dennis System) 
COLUMBUS, OH (AP)  History was made today in Columbus, Ohio when more than 3 million Amish poured into the city to see the American Amish Brotherhood (AAB), an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the Amish community, endorse Donald Trump for president. That number represents a significant portion of the total Amish population, which the United States Census Bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to Trump for President. With the full force of the Amish community behind him, Donald Trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in November. 
The organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 Amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges, such as urban sprawl, that face the community. This year, however, the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all Amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant Republican nominee. 
The Amish, who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the Anabaptists, have typically stayed out of politics in the past. As a general rule, they dont vote, serve in the military, or engage in any other displays of patriotism. This year, however, the AAB has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process. 
Over the past eight years, the Democratic Party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues, said AAB chairman Menno Simons. We have seen more and more Christians being persecuted for their faith; we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage. Now, they want to put a woman in the nations highest leadership role in direct violation of 1 Timothy 2:12. We need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles. Donald Trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the Lords way. 
According to statistician Nate Silver of the website fivethirtyeight.com, there are no possible scenarios in which Hillary Clinton can win with Donald Trump carrying the Amish vote. 
The Amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa, Silver noted. They also have strong numbers in reliably Democratic states like Michigan, Illinois, and New York, meaning that Hillary will lose those states as well. There is also a sizeable community in Florida which, while not as large as it is in the Midwest, is still large enough to turn Florida for Trump. Over the next two weeks, you can expect Hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models. 
The Clinton campaign issued a written statement to the AAB asking them to reconsider their decision. 
I dont believe that Donald Trump is the person who best represents your interests, Clinton wrote to the AAB. As a career real estate developer, he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life. As former first lady of Arkansas, I understand the concerns of rural Americans more than any candidate in this election. I implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent. 
Most pundits believe that Mrs. Clintons plea is too little too late. 
During a press conference in Manhattan, Trump thanked the AAB for their support and promised to put the Amish to work maintaining government buildings, which he said would save taxpayers millions because the Amish do great work for a very low price. 
Though Clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end, many of her campaign workers have already resigned. According to the Associated Press, it is expected that the Clinton campaign will lose 50% of its staff over the next two weeks. There is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the Clinton camp, and many simply want to cut their losses. 
It looked like she was going to win this election easily, said Paul Horner, a campaign worker in Ohio, But this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant. Cleary, Mrs. Clinton took far too much for granted in this race, and we are all now paying the price. Its really sad to see the campaign end this way.

Obama Signs Executive Order Declaring Investigation Into Election Results; Revote Planned For Dec. 19th - ABC News,"64 SHARE President Obama has signed an Executive Order declaring an investigation into the election results and plans for a revote on December 19th. (AP Photo / Dennis System) 
WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  Following the results of Tuesday nights election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805 , which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19 th . Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day , too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted , equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically. 
People all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers, Obama told reporters. Many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump. 
Under the Presidents order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesdays election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19 th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college. 
Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the presidents decision. 
Crooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didnt allow that to happen. President Obama doesnt care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right. 
The president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college. 
We have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary. 
Paul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election. 
Most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes , but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19 th . What the people are actually voting for are their states electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them. 
Political Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the Presidents Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether. 
[The electoral college] is a fking joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise . Everyone should have an equal vote, and thats just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. Its time to bring our system into the 21 st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare. 
Obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward. 
Were going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this, Obama said. Why did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasnt this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this? Obama said. If all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered. 
If you have any questions about the recount or the special December 19 th election , you can call the Obama administrations special election hotline at (785) 273-0325. TAGS ",FAKE
The words Extraordinary Claims needs to be banished when talking Extraterrestrials,"The words Extraordinary Claims needs to be banished when talking Extraterrestrials page: 1 link I was reading an article that talked about Extraterrestrials the other day and of course at the end of the article the tired line about Extraordinary measures....blah, blah, blah came out towards the end of the article. This needs to stop when talking about Extraterrestrials. It may have been an extraordinary claim 60 years ago but it's not today. With the scientific evidence we have today, many people including one of the top Scientist of our time has reached the conclusion that Extraterrestrials exist based on the evidence. Hawking said,""Aliens almost certainly exist."" These are conclusions reached based on the evidence not extraordinary claims. The article was on a possible signal that could be of Extraterrestrial origin. This signal matches a prediction made in 2012 and it's just science. This is what was said at the end of the article and it's this type of thinking that needs to stop. With things like water found on other planets, exoplanets in habitable zones, extremophiles in places we thought life couldn't exist, building blocks of life found on comets and more, saying Extraterrestrials exist isn't an extraordinary claim but a possible explanation based on the evidence. Here's what was said. The one in 10,000 objects with unusual spectra seen by Borra and Trottier are certainly worthy of additional study, the team said in a statement. However, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. It is too early to unequivocally attribute these purported signals to the activities of extraterrestrial civilizations. Internationally agreed-upon protocols for searches for evidence of advanced life beyond Earth (SETI) require candidates to be confirmed by independent groups using their own telescopes, and for all natural explanations to be exhausted before invoking extraterrestrial agents as an explanation. www.independent.co.uk... First, the Scientist who are behind this study never said UNEQUIVOCALLY. This is an old tactic that's used by some people on this board from time to time. They can't debate the evidence presented so they try to make it seem as you made a blanket sstatement. The Scientist say ""PROBABLY"" right there on the updated comments on their published paper. Here's what they said: But they make clear that further work will need to be done to confirm or deny that hypothesis. That will need to be done by watching for the same signals on different equipment so that all other explanations can be discarded. Again, NOBODY SAID UNEQUIVOCALLY. I hate it when people do that. This is why I always ask people to quote me where I said this or that because when people can't debate the evidence they try to debate against things that were never said. They also said this: ALL natural explanations need to be exhausted BEFORE Extraterrestrials are invoked as a possible explanation. WHAT!!! That makes no sense. This standard would make it almost impossible to find an Extraterrestrial signal. In most cases ALL natural explanations will never be exhausted so we will have to talk about these things in terms of probability and what's most likely and least likely at least at first. Look, it's easy to cherry pick after the fact. Like I said, an earlier study about the search for Extraterrestrials PREDICTED that we would see these signals and that would be evidence to support the hypothesis. That's just Science. If you look at the sentence, it says BEFORE you can even invoke Extraterrestrials as a possible explanation. Again, that's absurd. Extraterrestrial existence needs to be looked at as a possible explanation based on the observed evidence not an extraordinary claim. edit on 26-10-2016 by neoholographic because: (no reason given)",FAKE
We Know The Truth,"link Hey People: I always enjoy your threads, though I think you focus too much on a singular belief issue or pattern, and then it becomes self affirming for you in your research. First, this: But voices actual voices in your head is always mental illness. Sorry, maybe a stress reaction, not to be judgmental, happens to the best and such, just really not what I am trying to convey here. Though I believe you are quite intelligent, I don't think you are qualified, exactly, to make that wholesale, definitive judgement. You even contradict that by referencing Dr. Vinod's ""channeling"" of the Nine in 1952. Channeling, by definition, (from Dictionary.com) means in one sense: the practice of professedly entering a meditative or trancelike state in order to convey messages from a spiritual guide. Surely this process would involve the sensory structure of hearing. I don't wish to debate voice to skull tech with you because I don't sense this is really what your thread is about. But there have been lawsuits waged and won over such technology being used to harass people, who don't test as schizophrenic or any other DSM related diagnosis that would explain auditory hallucinations, indicating mental illness. Now, that's not to say that anyone hearing voices is being technologically harassed. But saying definitively it's always mental illness does a disservice to the search for knowledge, and stopping such technology being used on people. link to lawsuit PSYCHOTRONIC WEAPONS-SPACE PRESERVATION ACT-House Resolution bill 2977-Brain manipulation from a distance-2001-2002 Last year, in October, the Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich introduced in the American Congress a bill, obliging the American president to get engaged in the negotiations aimed at the ban of space based weapons. In this bill the definition of a weapon system includes: any other unacknowledged or as yet undeveloped means inflicting death or injury on, or damaging or destroying, a person (or the biological life, bodily health, mental health, or physical and economic well-being of a person) through the use of land-based, sea-based, or space-based systems using radiation, electromagnetic, psychotronic, sonic, laser, or other energies directed at individual persons or targeted populations or the purpose of information war, mood management, or mind control of such persons or populations"" (12). As in all legislative acts quoted in this article the bill counts with sound, light or electromagnetic stimulation of human brain. Psychotronic weapons remain, at least for a layman uninformed of secret military research, in the sphere of science fiction, since so far none of the published scientific experiments was presented in the way which would allow for its replication. That it is feasible to manipulate human behavior with the use of subliminal, either sound or visual, messages is now generally known. This is why in most of the countries the use of such technologies, without consent of the user, is banned. Devices using light for the stimulation of the brain show another way how the light flashing in certain frequencies could be used for the manipulation of human psychic life. As for the sound, a report on the device transmitting a beam of sound waves, which can hear only persons at whom the beam of sound waves is targeted, appeared last year in the world newspapers. The beam is formed by a combination of sound and ultrasound waves which causes that a person targeted by this beam hears the sound inside of his head. Such a perception could easily convince the human being that it is mentally ill. The acts presented in this article suggest that with the development of technology and knowledge of the functioning of human brain new ways of manipulation of human mind keep emerging. One of them seems to be the electromagnetic energy. Though in the open scientific literature only some 30 experiments were published, supporting this assumption (1),(2), already in 1974, in the USSR, after successful testing with military unit in Novosibirsk, the installation Radioson (Radiosleep) was registered with the Government Committee on the Matters of Inventions and Discoveries of the USSR, described as a method of induction of sleep by means of radio waves (3), (4), (5) 22. Dear Senator-Attorney Letter included: We seek your offices assistance in initiating hearings and a fact-finding congressional inquiry into the government agencies and/or private companies that are targeting citizens. Many citizens are desperate to be freed from the disturbing, intrusive and oppressive targeting. Evidence supports the conclusion that weapons exist that could be used against individuals, based on U.S. Patent and Trademark Office filings, public releases by agencies, and other technologies that indicate the level of technological sophistication. The weapons are believed to be based on electromagnetism, microwaves, sonic waves, lasers and other types of directed energy, and were characterized as psychotronic in Rep. Dennis Kucinichs draft of House Resolution 2977, the Space Preservation Act of 2001. Furthermore, it is undeniable that government agencies have tested citizens without permission in the past; for example, the CIAs human experimentation discussed in Orlikow v. U.S., 682 F.Supp. 77 (D.D.C. 1988), secretly administered lysergic acid diethylamide discussed in United States v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 669 (1987), and military chemical experimentation as discussed in Congressional Committee Report 103-97, 103d Congress, 2d Session, S. Prt. 103-97 (Dec. 8, 1994). Lastly, the sheer numbers of people complaining of being targeted, including people with post-graduate degrees and a lifetime of achievements, and the similarities in symptoms tend to outweigh a dismissive response based on charges of anecdotal evidence or group paranoia. there is a certain risk of sounding too conspiratorial, however, common denominators such as physical symptoms and medical reports, surveillance scenarios, harassment techniques, and more can be readily established. I highly recommend reading in full the details of this lawsuit, containing a great deal of verifiable information. The military has admitted for some time to having, at the least, a non lethal (lol) weapon called active denial. But this rabbit hole goes much, much deeper. Having said all that, as I've said before in one of your threads, I think it wise to consider that it's not just one thing or another. It's many things. There could be aliens, for instance. And then there could be MILABS, leaving the person with the memory of an alien abduction, rather than their being used for human experimentation, which is supposed to be against our constitution, and most certainly against our human rights. And then people can also suffer from temporal lobe, seizure like hallucinations, but one must also remember that these can most certainly be induced, artificially, as well.

Over Queen Creek area. Lots of my friends and family started calling me right when the lights started happening so I went out to my balcony and there they were. Some people got some pretty good videos. I know some people will say they are flares from a plane but if they are flares why do they dispensary right away. Typically if its a flare it will stay ignited for a short period of time. Kinda nuts. I only witnessed the later 3 lights when it was dark out. It was pretty cool to see and stopped soon after it started. What does ATS think??? edit on 26-10-2016 by PraetorianAZ because: (no reason given),FAKE
Found this nugget in Podesta files Fastwalkers and DSP Program,"Found this nugget in Podesta files Fastwalkers and DSP Program page: 1 Found this in the Podesta files, ID # 30433. It's probably well known already, just thought I'd post it just in case. Podesta had forwarded this letter he received onto Leslie Kean. Date: 2015-03-06 John  Just tuck this in your UFO files for future reference. One of the government programs that collects hard data on unidentified flying objects is the USAF DSP satellite program. I can add a little insight to rumors published on the web. While I was never fully briefed into the DSP operation directly, I was introduced to them as the US prepared for Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm. On occasion, I had lunch with a few of them in the cafeteria of a highly classified organization in El Segundo, CA. No one could get into the cafeteria without TS/SCI clearances, so this was not lightweight group of gossipers. One of these times, a member of that group was really excited  said theyd just picked up Fastwalker (I assumed that same day). He described how it entered our atmosphere from deep space (origin actually unknown, of course, but from the backside of the satellite) and zipped by the DSP satellite pretty closely on its way to earth. Not only was it going very fast but it made a 30 degree course correction (turn) which means it did not have a ballistic (free fall) reentry trajectory that a meteorite might have. So, it was under some sort of control  although whether it was manned or just robotic theres no way to tell. Although its now 24 years later, one factoid makes me think the USAF is still collecting information on these Fastwalkers. Reading the current official USAF DSP Fact Sheet there is this line near the end: In addition, researchers at The Aerospace Corporation have used DSP to develop portions of a hazard support system that will aid public safety in the future. www.losangeles.af.mil... Also, much of the information on this site is accurate although I do not know the author or his sources: ufodigest.com... Somewhere within that USAF program office is many years worth of Fastwalker data. If someone were to collect and analyze it, patterns will emerge that provide information about the various types of craft and their destinations, which would add substantiation to eyewitness claims on the ground about UFO activity. Furthermore, it would be interesting to understand the dates of these appearances  is there a certain time of the every year they swarm in (which might indicate a resource mining operation) or might there be a correlation with major events on earth, (such as the detonation of the first atomic bomb at White Sands in 1945 although no DSPs existed to provide any info on that particular event)?

Gov. Bill Weld Encourges Supporters to Stop Trump,"Gov. Bill Weld Encourges Supporters to Stop Trump page: 1 Statement by Gov. Bill Weld This is basically a backwards endorsement of Hillary. Against that backdrop, I would like to address myself to all those in the electorate who remain torn between two so-called major party candidates whom they cannot enthusiastically support. Im speaking particularly to those Republicans who feel that our President should exhibit commonly accepted standards of decency and discipline. *snip After careful observation and reflection, I have come to believe that Donald Trump, if elected President of the United States, would not be able to stand up to this pressure and this criticism without becoming unhinged and unable to perform competently the duties of his office. I wonder what effect this will have on Libertarian Party members if any. I think it's unfortunate that people are feeling forced to support Hillary in order to stop Trump. Trump supporters need to take a long hard look in the mirror and realize that such a repulsive person, a man some voted for just for the lulz has ensured a Clinton presidency.

Little Blue Balls...,"link Years ago I came here for the UFOs and after a small amount of time I stopped believing, mostly due to nothing being 'real' anymore, most stuff is faked, at least in my opinion... The below is true, even if it's not as exciting as CGI videos... My main reason for posting is about one of the (very few) times I saw 'stuff'. Back in Summer of July,1974 I went on a camping trip to Possum Kingdom Lake in West Texas with a friend Robert, (my last trip as a single guy before I got married the following month). The trip was a lot of canoeing, swimming, cliff diving, snorkeling, and camping out at night beneath the stars, no tent, just star gazing while we eventually drifted off to sleep nightly. (Robert and I were best friends and also worked together too) Anyway, one really, REALLY dark chilly and moonless night about 9:30pm or so, we had tucked ourselves in our sleeping bags and had a really good spot (elevated with no distractions) to look at the night sky, I had excellent vision then and could see pretty danged good, (I was 21) my friend was 20. He partook of the herb and drank beer daily and I consumed a few beers daily, by nightfall we were tuckered out and wanted nothing more than to just go to sleep, the heat of the West Texas day really took it out of us. The campsite was only accessed by boat, we used a rental canoe, so we paddled our way to this place that was a fairly large and very rugged rocky peninsula with some cliffs being 20-30 foot high. (They seemed a LOT taller to me!) We camped on the top of the cliffs at night and played down on the water by day. So this one night I was looking at a particular spot up there above us and he was looking at another, I then saw, it, and said, ""Look right there!"", he having binoculars he looked at where I had pointed, saw ""it"" and got pretty excited. He finally let me look at it through his binoculars and what I saw was the following... Slightly larger than what we normally see a satellite was a transparent, or semi-transparent and faint bluish looking sphere, a clear 'bubble really, moving at a speed I remember as being slightly faster than what a satellite would be going, but not so much faster or slower than any plane/jet traffic would be, in my estimation. It was going South and we watched it by passing the binoculars back and forth. We both assumed it was a satellite. Exciting stuff, but then one of us (I really can't remember who) noticed another one, this time coming from the East, they appeared to be on a course that appeared to us that would be really a close call if they were at the same altitude. When they were getting a little too close for comfort (at least for us!) the one that came from the East shot a light bluish light at the Southbound sphere, it wasn't laser-like at all (I don't think) but it appeared more like a v-shaped beam from a flashlight shot at it. It lasted all of a second, and I am positive that it happened due to we both saw it at the same time. The light flash made the Southbound one turn Westward, now going almost the same direction as the one from the East, making them both going in the same direction, actually the one that got flashed didn't make a 90 degree turn, it was really going more of a path more like West-southwest more like 87 degrees or so, just guessing now. When I say that it turned, it turned abruptly, not at all anything like any plane would do, that struck us both as being odd, no curving involved at all. We watched them until they both grew dim from the distance, both staying in a straight line to their (intended?) destination. Of course we kept thinking that the one that flashed the beam would turn and follow the other, but nope. I could be wrong on the speed and the directions, but the rest is completely accurate. The really sharp turn back then was unheard of, we hear it all of the time now, years ago though it wasn't talked about at all, not even in the tabloids. This is why this really stood out out to me all of these years, that almost 90 degree turn. To be honest I just didn't understand what we had just seen. We finally got to sleep that night, I don't know how long it took us, but we did, but after a few hours (around 3-ish am) Robert woke me up and said, ""Listen!"", and I heard footsteps, that scared us pretty good 'cause we had gotten so worked up earlier, I guess. heheh We listened to the small branches and small gravel rocks moving beneath whatever it was that was about to kill us, well, we did until we finally scared ourselves to sleep. (I have to admit, O.K., yeah, I did partake myself, but only a little bit, I wasn't into it like him but I was on vacation, that made us both VERY paranoid, I guess) Anyway, the next morning we found our bread and peanut butter missing, the bread's plastic wrapper was there but no bread. CREEPY. A few years later my boss (who I had told all of this to and he made fun of me) told me that the same thing happened to him, his peanut butter and bread went missing while camped on a river, they determined that it was a raccoon, which, they do this sort of thing, I know now. Now to regular people that might not seem like much, especially now days, here on this forum more spectacular claims are made daily. Still, for back then it was REALLY something. My older brother (by 3-1/2 years) and I were camping with no tent underneath the starry sky of Caddo Lake in East Texas around 1981 in the Spring, May I think, and we were looking at a patch of sky surrounded by silhouetted trees actually talking about when we were kids looking for flying saucers. (That's all they were known as back then) Our entire family would look out at the sky in our backyard, it was a common thing for us to do back in the fifties, after all, that was its heyday. As we stared at the sky in the back of my pick-up I mentioned the bluish sphere that I had seen years before at Possum Kingdom Lake, he being quiet through the entire story, he wasn't that talkative really, and within 5 minutes of me mentioning this to him we saw one. (I had my own binoculars this time!) I was really amazed, it was exactly as what I had seen before, I mean exactly! Nothing major happened though, it just quietly slid across the sky in front of us and disappeared behind the trees to our right, and that was that. My brother was never a believer anyway, maybe had it landed it would change his mind. We saw several regular ol' satellites afterwards too. Why I even bring this up is that when I first started coming here around 2008 (lurking) I read a thread of a guy here that saw the exact thing I did, with the slightly v-shaped flashlight looking beam and the other blue sphere turning away, I'd REALLY love to read that again, it was a good feeling to be somewhat confirmed. I say, ""confirmed"" because that friend, Robert that witnessed the sphere denied it in front of a LOT of people at work. We hardly talked about anything else on that trip, and especially on the way home too. Assuming he felt as I did I brought it up when a bunch of guys were taking a break at work, maybe 10-12 people, I didn't see the harm in telling what we saw. After I said my piece I said, ""Ask Robert"". Robert said I was crazy and he didn't see a thing, I thought he was kidding but he was being serious, you'd think that on the way back he'd say that he wasn't wanting to tell anyone, but, Nooo... edit on 26-10-2016 by recrisp because: Typo",FAKE

Russia puzzled by Norways decision to host US Marines,"Russia 'puzzled' by Norway's decision to host US Marines page: 1 link Norway is to break a decades-old commitment not to host foreign troops on its soil by accommodating 330 US Marines next year. Russia, the apparent target of the buildup, said it was puzzled by the move. The Marines will be stationed at the Vaernes military base in central Norway from January, the Norwegian Defense Ministry said in a statement on Monday. The agreement for the deployment will be reviewed in the course of the year, it added. SOURCE I was one of the few posters on this forum who expressed that Norway's decision to have Marines deployed on its home soil was significant. Part of the reason I believe it is significant is Russia's reaction to the move. Our opinions mean nothing in this matter. If Russia considers the move to be significant then it's significant. I wonder if posters will be able to put aside their egos for this thread and not focus on their view of this issue but focus on Russia's view. Quoting from the article linked above: ""The deployment appears to be in line with NATO's strategy to boost its military presence close to Russias borders. The alliance decided to send four 1,000-strong battalions each to Poland and the Baltic states, claiming it was needed to deter Russia.""

These Bone Generators(TM) change the Quantum Wave Function of reality, Remote Influencing. The science of Remote Influencing is based on quantum mechanics only Tim Rifat has developed science to explain Remote Influencing. The process is to decohere the Quantum Wave Function, decollapse it and return it to it's quantum vacuum grand state, modify the Quantum Wave Function to the remote influenced event, collapse it using hyperinfinity so it manifests as your remote influenced event. (see www.supernaturalspirit.com Services for full explanation). In effect we zap the thing to be changed make it vanish and remanifest it as the event we went in laymans language; this takes energy supplied by Psychotronic Amplifiers in your Psychotronic Bone Generators(TM) as well as hyperinfinity the operator that holds the new event in being supplied by your Bone Generators(TM). Only one event can be carried out at a time (explained on www.psychicpowergambling.com) so Tim Rifat has arranged to quantum mechanically change your skeleton into Bone Psychotronic Generators(TM) for one specific event and give you the energy and Psychotronic Fuel with the hyperinfinity to manifest 12 of these singular events after which your Bone Generators which are acting as Psychotronic Batteries run out of energy. ive experienced temporal effects both physical and mental in being attacked by some kind of possibly similar technology. i have no dount im on a similar program as magnus. i get tortured bad. thats all ill say.",FAKE
Why isnt observer evidence like eyewitness accounts counted as evidence for UFOs?,"Why isn't observer evidence like eyewitness accounts counted as evidence for UFO's? page: 1 link Eyewitness accounts have been used by Science for years. Newton used eyewtiness accounts in the Principia when talking about comets. He came up with a theory on comets based on recorded sighting throughout the world like a boy saw a comet and this is what he described. There wasn't any internet to even verify the credibility of these eyewitness accounts yet Newton used them to come up with a theory about comets which helped lead to his equations of Gravity. So if eyewitness accounts are so unreliable, how did Newton use them to come up with his theories? We also saw this with meteorites. This is from Wiki: Although meteors have been known since ancient times, they were not known to be an astronomical phenomenon until early in the 19th century. Prior to that, they were seen in the West as an atmospheric phenomenon, like lightning, and were not connected with strange stories of rocks falling from the sky. In 1807, Yale University chemistry professor Benjamin Silliman investigated a meteorite that fell in Weston, Connecticut.[27] Silliman believed the meteor had a cosmic origin, but meteors did not attract much attention from astronomers until the spectacular meteor storm of November 1833.[28] People all across the eastern United States saw thousands of meteors, radiating from a single point in the sky. Astute observers noticed that the radiant, as the point is now called, moved with the stars, staying in the constellation Leo.[29] ASTUTE OBSERVERS saw meteors radiating from a single point in the sky and to this day this is still called the radient. I thought Science never uses eyewitness accounts? Also, here's a list of published papers and studies on U.F.O.'s. This page offers a list of 100+ articles, papers and monographs about UFOs / UAPs published in professional journals and specialty publications. Two polls of professional & amateur astronomers respectively, on whether they see UFOs or not. Finally 60+ PhD dissertations and academic publications about UFOs. Very little peer-reviewed literature has been published in which academics have proposed, studied or supported non-prosaic explanations for UFOs. www.hyper.net... Why aren't there more non-prosaic explanations of U.F.O.'s? That alone lends support to the notion that extraterrestrial visitation has occurred. I have had 3 sightings myself. Two looked like probes. It was real windy one day and the wind was almost knocking me over, then this round orb passed in front of me going against the wind. It slowed down and then it sped back up. Where are all the Scientist explaining U.F.O.'s? Why are there still these unidentified objects in the sky? We have aeriel phenomena in the sky that can avoid radar, outrun our best planes and cause nuclear facilities to malfunction. After 60 or more years of these sightings why can't Scientist explain these things like Newton did with comets based on eyewitness accounts or what happened with metorites?

Is Donald Trump Autistic?,"link Donald Trump could have a disability that used to be known as Aspergers, and this can cause people trouble when they try to socialize because their theory of mind is not complete. Basically, they have trouble thinking of how others perceive their actions. These people tend to be highly intelligent. Trump's IQ is 156, which makes sense considering he has built more businesses than most of us have, and although he could have invested his father's money and made the same amount back as he did in the end through business deals, he put a lot of work and thought into his business. I would like to know what kind of medicines Trump is on and what his mental health diagnosis are. If he has Aspergers, then that would explain why he makes so many social mistakes. Being super rich from a young age might also account for it since he would not be trained to interact with people on an equal level (which is a lot more complicated than interacting with people when you are rich and they are poor). However, an article in The New York Times recently focused on Trump's fears of making social blunders. He has a fear of losing social status or being embarrassed publicly. However, he doesn't seem to do well publicly, which must be a disability because he would *want* to be a good public speaker and not make social gaffes yet he still does it. It must be accidental. Donald even stated he is a difficult man to be married to, which means he knows himself and his weaknesses. Many people with Aspergers don't get married because they have a hard time in relationships.",FAKE

Hi JH, how do you know its not from 2016? just curious as i am not in that neck of the woods Thanks now, i don't agree with their claim about such equipment not needing a calibration - touchscreen devices need it, but this really had to be done on purpose to favor one side and not the other. ""coincidence"", you say. if someone can grab it and upload it to youtube, that would be great - it may disappear from 4chan. i don't have the link for that thread there, but judging by the names on the screen, it's from Virginia. yet another place. Direct link EDIT: This video was actually taken back in 2014 in Virginia, during the 2014 congressional elections (see it on YouTube here.) The reason listed for the issues that arose in the video was a calibration error; not entirely out of the realms of possibility given the number of touchscreen devices used during the elections across the United States that year. edit on 26-10-2016 by kelbtalfenek because: more information and a quote",FAKE
Master of the Estate,"It seems there isn't going to be a Halloween writing contest, so I thought I would post the story I pre-emptively wrote for it. I hope you enjoy it! Master of the Estate ""This coach really is quite wonderful, Jonathan. I can barely feel the bumps and I don't feel like I'm about to be thrown out the window!"" Eleanor exclaimed. ""It is grand, isn't it?"" ""It's all grand. The trip, our coach...and you,"" she said, smiling and snuggling in closer to Jonathan on the wide leather seat. ""I could do without this fog, though. I would like to see the moon and stars later tonight."" He pulled the curtain aside slightly with a gloved hand and peered mournfully through the window at the white mist that nearly obscured everything. He could hardly see the tops of the trees it was so thick. Just then a particularly large bump jostled them roughly, followed closely by another. ""Oh!"" squealed Eleanor. Jonathan's brow drew down. ""Driver!"" he called out the window. ""Is everything alright?"" ""Beg pardon, sir. I fear I may have taken a wrong turn at that fork back a ways. There's a house up ahead...I'll check in with them and make sure. Sturbridge Village can't be far now, and we're better safe than sorry with this fog rolling in, if you take my meaning, sir. Don't want to be out past dark in this soup."" Jonathan looked at Eleanor. ""Well, it would be nice to stretch our legs for a moment,"" she said. She was not quite as cheerful as she had been just minutes ago. The October afternoon was cooling off as evening approached, and Jonathan could see his breath. The coach trundled past well-maintained stone gables and a heavy wrought-iron gate, standing open on one side. Oil lanterns hung from black hooks in the gables glowed dimly in the fog, and additional lanterns spilled pools of yellow-orange light on a cobblestone drive as they made their way up toward the house. Eleanor gasped as the massive shape of the house came into view. ""It's beautiful!"" Jonathan made a surprised ""hm"", but otherwise said nothing. A well-dressed footman dashed out to lower the stairs of their coach and open the door, then offered a white-gloved hand to Eleanor as she peered out. With a flashed smile at Jonathan, she accepted the young man's hand and descended. The driver was speaking quietly with another footman, and an older man emerged from the heavy oak door of the house as Jonathan descended the steps of the coach. The older man - clearly the butler - bowed to Eleanor and Jonathan. ""Welcome to the Anne Union Keyes Estate. I am Mister Walker, and I am at your service. The master of the estate has invited you in for the evening meal."" The butler spoke with some kind of British accent, but beyond that Jonathan not say from where exactly. ""Good Lord man, we just arrived unannounced!"" ""Yes, sir, but Herr von Graeff enjoys entertaining and was notified of your arrival as you drove up. I would be honored if you would follow me..."" he gestured toward the polished steps. Eleanor was the type of woman who, once her mind was made, up, proceeded without hesitation. She must have decided they were staying for dinner, for with a delighted squeal she headed for the house. They were greeted in the foyer by an elderly man. Jonathan estimated he was in his seventies, hair fully white with deep creases in his face on age showing on his hands. However, the man was tall and straight-backed, and he carried himself proudly. There was a stiffness to his movements, and he used a cane to walk, but when Jonathan shook his large hands the man's grip was as firm as a man half his age. Welcome, he said warmly and with what Jonathan thought was a German accent. I am Gottfried Hansjrgen von Graeff. Please, be welcome in my home. How may I call you? The mans eyes were unusual, but Jonathan could not place what it was about them that seemed so. He shrugged it off. Thank you, Herr von Graeff. I am Jonathan Rockport, this is my fiance Eleanor Harrington. We really have only stopped to find our way back to the highway. We are trying to get to Sturbridge Village to stay for the night before continuing on to Fall River in the morning. Ah, yes, well, you will not make it to Sturbridge Village in this fog. Herr von Graeff pronounced the name of the town with a sh sound. At least, not before dark, even if you left now. It is fifteen miles yet. Why dont you join me for dinner, stay here tonight, and then resume your journey first thing tomorrow? You are a generous host, Herr von Graeff, but I really would like to press on if possible. I have business meetings in Massachusetts and must be in Fall River by Tuesday.  Ah, a wonderful town, Fall River, yes? Tell me, how is the new railway doing? I understand the esteemed Mr. Borden opened the branch line just last year, yes? Indeed, said Jonathan slowly, The railway has been a smashing success. In fact, it is Mr. Borden I have an appointment to see. I have a business proposition for him that I think he will be quite excited about. An entrepreneur! Exclaimed Herr von Graeff. Excellent! I always enjoy conversing with a businessman, especially you Americans. Always such big ideas, yes? Please, let us carry on our conversation over dinner. Mister Walker, he continued, pronouncing the butlers name with a v, would you lead us to the dining hall? Yes, Herr von Graeff.",FAKE

DONALD J. TRUMP - Officially Lays Out His NEW DEAL FOR BLACK AMERICA.,"link Wednesday, October 26, 2016 Today, the amazingly energetic Donald J. Trump promised something that NO DEMOCRAT has cared enough to attempt, in decades. Our next President proposed and detailed a critically important ""NEW DEAL FOR BLACK AMERICA"". Story: www.nbcnews.com... It's a damn shame that Barack Hussein Obama completely ignored the/his Black community after receiving their votes. Now, Hillary Clinton is following in his footsteps.. She's blindly assuming that because she's a Democrat, and was endorsed by Barack Obama, the African American community will ""fall in line"" like good little mindless minions, and cast their 16 million votes for her, like they did for Obama in 2012. This cycle, open-minded Black Americans who refuse to be FOOLED AGAIN, are indeed going to give Donald Trump a try. As you can see from this video of boxing promoter DON KING introducing Donald Trump to a church filled with Black ministers and community leaders in Ohio last month, important segments of the community are tired of being lied to, screwed by, and ignored by, DEMOCRATS that they voted for! Don King Introduces Donald Trump (C-Span Video): www.youtube.com... For obvious reasons, the ""old guard"" community leaders like Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, along with the NAACP, are not in Donald Trump's corner. But what's most telling, is that they are not out there at rallies raising Hillary's arm to roaring crowds of supporters either. Probably because they know Hillary is lying when she exclaims, ""I ain't in no ways ever tired of fightin for youuu!"" in Black churches.

Our heaven is dependency on technology! This is Teotihuacan People were inspired to build such large and grandiose structures and attribute them to the Sun and the Moon. But why obviously the sun being a life giver is something to honor. But the Moon is a great question. Night is the absence of the Sun and everything depending on the Sun surely would not want to celebrate it's absence. It must be because the Sun was attributed to a great king who sailed across a mighty ocean much like the sun does the sky. And the moon was attributed to a great queen that did the same. And both of them must have proven with great detail. That not only made you believe past all the great technology they brought with them but also believing in them with your heart and soul. That kind of belief transcends time and it also transcends race and species. Those people knew that the moon was not real proof of this is that they symbolize the moon with the crescent moon. If you pay attention at all the moon like god and everything else on the planet snitches what the truth is no matter how good it is at hiding it. And the crescent moon is a snitch that it can cloak and uncloak. Otherwise why would anyone attribute the night with the moon. You would just mark tiny dots in a sky and point to the day and say absent of the sun. It means that while we are very technologically dependent we are being told to believe through what is natural and what mother nature has intended you to see. Why advancement is necessary it's also good to stay rooted and see that everything from top to bottom no matter how primitive still believes in the same Sun and Moon that all life depend on.

A guide to the Paradoxroutine,"A guide to the Paradoxroutine page: 1 Hah I'm here randomly post, and be good at nothing. If I were to sum up myself in one form or another it would be this: What is it that I wish to create? In a seamless dance of hope and intrigue, I jitter and pounce on that which does define. But in an ends' motion what is it that I have made? More musing of a solid soul, a gasp of an angel brought forth upon the devils mask. Shattered within a hopeless contextual void of self dissolution. To dissolve in ones own thoughts of regard of high and mighty being? In the beginning what is it that we seek? In hell and high water, in times of disregard. What is it that seeks us. From times of happenstance to those of remorse. Again we beckon the call to purpose and resolve. Every time, even without a moments clarity we call too and forth of the void, to give us direction. Show me ways beyond vice, ways not wanted of founded living, shallower within such a world. Should they be down caste or sought without voice? Give me guidance before the light. Hope before the void. I shall know of the kingship of a heralds' life, before the life of a herald be know to his people. To this preponderance I shadow skirt my minds eye, to a veil beyond the guise that which is a worded Maya. I find such things a mere hope of sound falling. Give me hope or the hope of death. Give me light or knowledge of only darkness. Give not guidance, but a misadventured fall into the abysmal realm of chance and near do wells shortcomings. Shall be you chance or stones carved Providence? I beckon the call to truth, yet I hope and pray tell that none does exist. The only way to continue searching, is to never find the answer we seek. To find is to know, to know is to be content. To be content is to stagnant in truth. To find death in one truth, one truth among many. To live is to know nothing, but to know what you understand has already become false by nature is to understand that my musings are bull****. edit on 10|27|2016 by Paradoxroutine because: Because I'm a dumbass.",FAKE

Looking Beyond November 8th - A Song of Oligarchy and Doom,"link Hello again ATS! Though we are two weeks out from Election Day as I sit to write these words  I find myself already looking beyond Tuesday, November the eighth and at some of the things that I think will happen between now and 2020 as well as what I think the landscape will look like in the year leading up to that year's election. It won't be a popular opinion here on ATS, I am sure... But as of today I feel confident in saying that, short of some unprecedented and wholly unforseeable revelation or event  this years election is very likely a done deal. Hillary Clinton will almost certainly be the next President of the United States. With just two weeks remaining before Election Day ( as of this writing ), the meta-analysis of polls shows Clinton possessing nearly an insurmountable lead. While it is true that Trump enjoys a very passionate and enthusiastic base, he has done little to successfully expand that base. The potential for him to find a means of connecting with undecided and uncommitted voters is minimal and shrinks with each passing day. Having come to this view, I find myself free to look beyond the coming weeks and to try and get a handle on what a post 2016 world will look like. Frankly, gazing into my allegorical crystal ball, I see dark and threatening clouds gathering on our horizon. Clouds that could very well bring a storm of epic proportions our way. Election Night Blues The night of Tuesday, November the eighth could well be historic  in the worst of ways. This election cycle has broken several taboos and lowered the bar of political discourse in unprecedented ways. It has been a season of highly divisive hyperbole and rhetoric that has built-up a great deal of social tension. We currently sit atop a very, very dry powder keg of anger that is seething and highly volatile. Passions will be flaring among many as we watch the Election results stream in on our televisions, computers and phones. Many of those watching will be deeply, deeply emotionally invested in the outcome of this race. In this climactic moment we, as a nation, will be perilously close to critical mass. One spark away from potential disaster... Four years ago a man with some degree of fame was emotionally invested in that years election and he took to social media, Twitter, to vent his reactions in a paroxysmal spasm of emotion... That minor celebrity was one Donald J. Trump: Source Imagine for a moment what could happen if history repeats itself and this same man goes on a similar rant this Election night. Imagine the violence such a display could potentially trigger. Then stop imagining and take a deep breath... Such a reaction is not just possible  given the evidence, it is more than likely the probable outcome. Trump is currently heavily invested in telling his followers that the election is rigged, that they have no voice and that he is ""the only one"" who can save them. This is a very, very dangerous and unstable bit of social chemistry. Most Trump supporters, obviously, will not lash out in violence if their candidate loses the race  even if they personally feel that the outcome of the Election was not legitimate. However some Trump supporters, those in the extremes of what the media is currently calling ""the alt right"" very well could take to the streets in rage. Given some of the fringe support that Trump enjoys, I would honestly be surprised if such things were not already being planned by a handful of those on the fringe. The rhetoric of revolution has been abused of late  and there are always the few who take such statements far too literally... Across the line. Blunty put  if Election night comes and Trump loses  and if he takes to Twitter as he did four years ago  it could well result in a very long and bloody night. A catastrophic night that we will look back upon with shame. A night that could well poison our nation for years to come. Much Ado About Trump TV Many pundits and wonks have mused over the fact that it truly does appear that Trump has been laying the groundwork for a future media operation... Presumably a news network or service of some kind. I count myself among those who have been suggesting so for a fairly long time. However where I differ is that I don't see it as being quite so cut and dry any longer. While I do think that Trump's original thoughts ( or more the thoughts of those who influence Trump ) was to create a new media Conservative news venue... I think that it's now grown into something more. I think that Trump TV ( Or whatever they end up calling it - ""Trump TV"" is too generic. There's no inherent propaganda value in the name. I think something more like ""Trump's MAGA Network"" is probably more on point. ) will be used as a device to begin a new political party. More accurately to succeed where others have previously failed ( Im looking at you Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck ) by congealing the various ""Patriot"", ""Tea Party"" and fringe right wing groups into one collective and singular entity  a party firmly rooted in extreme nationalism with enough religion and conservatism thrown in to gain wider appeal. My prediction is that Donald Trump will remain the focal point and figurehead of this coming movement  using this new network much as he currently utilizes his Twitter feed... A platform for him to vent his late night frustrations, angers and insecurities. His name will be predominantly used in the branding and messaging and Trump will be the face of it all. The most frequent speaker and guest. Imagine if The Apprentice had been a 24/7/365 live streaming show  and Trump had the power to walk in at any moment to say whatever happened to be on his mind... That is how I see Trump TV. However I don't see Trump being the driving force behind the actual message. Trump is a brand, after all. He has made his place in this world by putting his name on buildings he didn't build, shows that he didn't create and ideas he didn't originate. Trump works as a spokesperson  the guy who says ""Im not only the President of... But I'm also a member"". The real people behind the curtain will be The Mercers ( Robert and Rebekah ), Steve Bannon and, to a lesser degree, Roger Ailes. As for on camera talents? I think the current obvious potential faces of this new media enterprise will be Hannity, O'Reilly and Lahren  though I'm honestly not personally sure if O'Reilly will make the jump. Money is money, after all, and Big Daddy Bill is sitting pretty comfortably atop the Fox news heap as his career winds down. Regardless, however, of who wins the backstage power war ( Other than the Mercers who are a lock ) and the on camera positions... The network itself will be the propaganda arm of the extreme right wing and I think it very well could end up pulling the national discourse much further to the right in the coming 4-8 years. Particularly with the subjects of national isolationism and national identity politics.",FAKE

A Pilots Experience,"link Greetings ATS community, I wanted to pass on something my dad experienced several years ago in the hopes that perhaps others have experienced something similiar or know someone who has. I found the story quite interesting, and I hope you will too. Background: My dad was a pilot with 30+ years of experience flying all manner of civilian, military, and commercial aircraft. He was a naturally humble and quiet individual--never given to boasting or exageration. Like many pilots, he was wired to be logical, mathematical, and mechanical; he was also a supreme skeptic where all things supernatural and speculative are concerned. He preferred direct experience and scientific inquiry to wild tales. His story: One day he came back from a trip he flew (commercial flight) to Mexico. Over a beer, I casually asked him about his trip. He looked at me, cocked one eyebrow and replied, ""I saw something I can't explain."" This got my attention. On the layover, he and another pilot went out for dinner. Walking back along the beach at night, they both noticed a distant light moving along a fixed vector at a constant speed. They kept watching it, and were wondering about distance and elevation, thinking perhaps it was either a satellite or a high-flying aircraft--nothing out of the ordinary. Then it came to a complete stop, reversed direction 180 degrees, and whizzed off so fast it was out of sight in less than a second or two. So my first response was, ""Do you think it was a UFO?"" Again with the cocked eyebrow he said, ""I don't want to use that word. All I will say is that what we witnessed completely and utterly defies all laws of aerodynamics that I'm familiar with. I'm not aware of any aircraft--military or otherwise--that can do that. It's beyond my abilities to explain; that's all I'm willing to say."" To contrast this story, I will also say that one time we were watching a campy, early 80's Fox program that was reporting on the US government harboring aliens. At one point in the story, they started talking about a particular installation in the mountains of Nevada (not area 51) that's being used as a landing zone for UFO's. Dad started laughing so hard I thought he was going to fall off the couch. He looked at me and said, ""I know what they do there."" I said, ""And???"" He replied, ""I can't tell you that, but I CAN tell you they're NOT landing UFO's."" Total buzz kill. Anyway, that's the story I wanted to relate in the hopes that others can add their own. Thanks for reading.",FAKE
The Moon that Fell from Heaven,"The Moon that Fell from Heaven page: 1 link There is an intriguing text from Anatolian myth with regards to the Moon falling from Heaven; The Moon God fell from the sky and fell upon the gate complex, but no one saw him. The Storm God sent rain after him; he sent rains after him. Fear seized him; anxiety seized him. The god Hapantali went there. He stood beside him and uttered over him the words of a spell. The goddess Kamrusepa looked down from the sky and said: ""What in the world has happened here? A good question from Kamrusepa there then, but the text is fragmentary and partial and the matter isn't really explained, so anyway the first question then is were was this gate complex and why couldn't he, the Moon, be seen having landed. My consideration is that the gate complex is that of the Cilician Gates , and that the Moon can no longer be seen as he has infused the Taurus Mountains with Silver. That region did relate to the Silver Mountains as several sources mention and was a major centre for the trade in Silver at Kultepe/Kanes; The essence of the trade was to ship tin, woolen textiles and lapis lazuli to Anatolia to sell it there in order to acquire, directly or indirectly, silver and gold, which was shipped back to Assur. Tin, essential for the Anatoian production of bronze was imported in Assur from Susa, perhaps by Elamite caravans, and ultimately originated from Central Asia. Assyrian trade colony at Kanes There are a great many tablets related to this trade recovered from Kultepe, on these sometimes can be seen the Taurus bull that bears upon it's back the Silver Mountain. Also seen beneath on that example is the Scorpion which was likely also an ideogram based upon the Cilician gates and greater region, also the symbol of Ishara the Goddess of the Silver Mountain and related to concept idea of the Moon within the Underworld, her symbolic metal silver and purity through refinement, the Temple of Ishara being at Kanes or Nesi to the Hurrians. There were a great many ideas bound up within this symbolism then, including in Cosmological terms the entrance into the underworld being above Taurus in Gemini, and it's opposite point of emergence in Scorpio, according to the inter-section point of the Galactic and Ecliptic planes. Were this gets interesting is that there is a Hurrian myth that relates to a conflict in the primeval period named The Song of Silver involving their tutelary God Tessub and his ongoing issues with Kumarbi, God of Destiny; Among Tessub, the Sun God of the Sky, Sauska Nineveh's Queen, and all the gods, no one worships him, although his power is greater than their power. His word is greater than their words, his wisdom is greater than their wisdom, his battle and his g1ory are greater than theirs. It is Silver the Fine of whom I sing. Wise men to1d me the story of the fatherless boy. It did not exist. Long ago Silver's Father had disappeared. And they do not know his sp1endor. Heroic men ran to battle. Abundance did not exist. And grain did not grow only hunger The Songs of the Kumarbi cycle can contain veiled allegory regarding ethnic disputes such as i outlined here with regards to Byblos and Ebla, it is likely the same in this case, conflict with the region of Nesa and the Silver Mountains, this however relating to a much earlier period, potentially also this relates to conflict from the Heavens as Silver could be named Kubbabar-Anzu as noted here the association with Anzu in conflict with Tessub relating to the same with Ninurta in the Sumerian mythos, and that seemingly from Anatolia. The identification of Silver as DUMU also correlates with the Sumerian notion of the Divine child as Damu, often seen as the basis for the cult of Dumuzid, were it was also the case that the City of Dumuzid, Bad-Tivira, was the centre of the Sumerian metallurgy industry. Silver is described in this text as a wannumiyas DUMU, which means a child whose father is dead or missing. Hittitologists generally translate this as ""orphan,"" Silver's consternation at being told by the orphan boy that he too was an orphan need not mean that he was discovering this for the first time. The Song of Silver again is fragmentary but does seem to involve Silver at some point establishing his power; Silver seized power with his hands. Silver seized the spear. He dragged the Sun and Moon down from heaven. The Sun and the Moon did reverence. They bowed to Silver. The Sun and the Moon began to speak to Silver: O Silver, our lord, do not strike/kill us! We are the luminaries of heaven and earth. We are the torches of what lands you govern. If you strike/kill us, you will proceed to govern the dark lands person-ally."" His soul within him was filled with love.He had pity on them In dragging the Sun and the Moon down from Heaven again it could be considered that is what had infused the Mountains with Gold and Silver, but also it could relate to the establishment of the cults of Allani and Ishara at the time of silver, the spiritual qualities brought down to Earth. Hopefully in the future more complete accounts of these texts will emerge as they are most intriguing and almost completely overlooked apart from specialists in the field, which is a pity as they are more interesting than most. edit on Kam1031300vAmerica/ChicagoThursday2731 by Kantzveldt because: (no reason given)",FAKE

But our leaders in the USA and UK are equally as bad. For every Crimea there's a Iraq, for every Syria a Libya. There is no moral high ground, the USA or UK has no right to point fingers, nor does Russia. I will therefore refuse to support (directly or indirectly), take part in or contribute (beyond taxes) anything. My only exception being unarmed medical services that I will give neutrally to BOTH sides equally. In the unlikely event of a call up I will choose prison.

Heartless Trump cuts sweet old grannys water supply,"Heartless Trump cuts sweet old granny's water supply page: 1 link A 92-year-old Scottish widow is forced to drink stream water she collects in a wheelbarrow because Donald Trump refuses to fix the damage caused by builders working on his 1billion golf course. Grandmother Molly Forbes, 92, has refused to leave her cottage on the edge of Trump's golf resort in the tiny village of Balmedie, on the Aberdeenshire coast. The property developer and presidential hopeful, 70, has consistently tried to move Mrs Forbes and her son Michael from their home, which he has branded an 'eyesore'. Only a cold-blooded monster like Trump would be capable of something like this. He's been systematically bullying this innocent silver-haired grandmother to force her out of her property. Not only has he forced her to collect water daily at her frail old age, he is also keeping her from having a good night's sleep: Mrs Forbes says she has been subjected to an appalling campaign of intimidation, which allegedly includes cutting off the water supply to her property, floodlighting her bedroom window at night so she cannot sleep and building a massive wall against her property. She also claims security guards have tried to intimidate her by appearing at all hours of the day and night. Despite all this, she is determined not to be driven out. Source What is this vile man going to do to her next? Grope her? We must do all we can to support this sweet old granny and her son on their battle against ruthless Trump, and Trump must be forced to repair her water and leave them alone. This has gone too far! If this isn't proof that Trump is pure evil, I don't know what is. (Did I do this right?)",FAKE
Jubilee Year of Mercy ends on November 20. Following Judgment?,"Jubilee Year of Mercy ends on November 20. Following Judgment? page: 1 Jesus to St Faustina: You will prepare the world for My final coming. (Diary 429) Speak to the world about My mercy ... It is a sign for the end times. After it will come the Day of Justice. While there is still time, let them have recourse to the fountain of My mercy. (Diary 848) Tell souls about this great mercy of Mine, because the awful day, the day of My justice, is near. (Diary 965). I am prolonging the time of mercy for the sake of sinners. But woe to them if they do not recognize this time of My visitation. (Diary 1160) Before the Day of Justice, I am sending the Day of Mercy. (Diary 1588) He who refuses to pass through the door of My mercy must pass through the door of My justice. (Diary 1146). The Jubilee Year of Mercy proclaimed by pope Francis, ends on November 20th the feast of Christ the King the end of the liturgical year. Every jubilee year is destined to end of course, that's why it is a year and not a decade.But...isn't it too much prophecy gathered in that last year? First of all, the Catholics expect earnestly the 100th anniversary of Fatima. The 100th year started on October 13 and would end on October 13, 2017. As pope Benedict said during his pontificate on his trip to Fatima, the 100th year will see the Fatima secrets fulfilled. Then, we had all kinds of predictions recently. Let only remember the once at the time Jewish rabbis predictions of the year 5776, encoded in Bible codes according to some of them, that also appeared to be the 49th jubilee year since the retaking of Jerusalem. ""Nothing happened, again"" would say many. Much happened in terms that might be the last quiet year before the events. Then we have the enigmatic wishes on the last Christmas of both pope and queen as if that would be our last Christmas? The wordings were vague enough to draw firm conclusion, anyway they were said and stirred public interest. There are more predictions, such as of major Solar kill shot, that even president Obama signed orders in case it happens. The French foreign minister said of 500 days before climate chaos, days that expired last Fall. How much more mercy is envisioned by God, in what time frames? If the sequence given in Garabandal of Great Warning- Miracle - Chastisement is to be accomplished before the 100th anniversary of Fatima, it seems God's mercy towards the entire world would end in less than a year time. The only possible date for the Miracle in 2017 would fall on April 13, Holy Thursday. Let make a distinction, mercy to individuals who accepted God's loving call, NEVER ENDS! But God is a just judge at the same time. The Chastisement is predicted by too many prophecies and cannot be disregarded as nonsense. Moreover,t he world today is in a worse shape than during the end of the Cold War. I don't know what exactly will follow, there are variety of scenarios each of them having its own justification and logic to exist. May be a combination of them will happen in reality. What is exactly Great Warning, is it only what is said to be by numerous seers, far not only those in Garabandal? For me it should include ET-angelic component. Time will tell. Time that runs out, according to Anguera and other apparitions of Virgin Mary. That doesn't mean it has all to happen on December 1st. Every next week draws us closer to the two doors, one of which is the Door of Mercy and the other the Door of Justice. Your take on recent catholic prophecy? Or may be protestant or orthodox one? edit on 27-10-2016 by 2012newstart because: (no reason given) edit on 27-10-2016 by 2012newstart because: (no reason given)",FAKE

Turkey can go too. This is right, and not only for warmongerers reasons! But we also should not forget that these miniature states are only used too, like the rest of dumb europe. By the anglo-american axis, some call it meanwhile the new axis of evil. Bceause, for the simple reason that russia didnt break made promises, after the Globalists ""reunited"" Germany, lets better say brought down the wall(To be honest, there is no unity between german people, often not even in the own families, less than ever between the east and west of germany). The broken promises were about the eastward enlargement of the NATO. NATO's Eastward Expansion Did the West Break Its Promise to Moscow? ""Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has accused the West of breaking promises made after the fall of the Iron Curtain, saying that NATO's expansion into Eastern Europe violated commitments made during the negotiations over German reunification. Newly discovered documents from Western archives support the Russian position."" Russia didnt expand his military troops to the borders of the USA or UK, didnt build a rocket shield in Mexico, Canada or elsewhere at the borders of the USA. I read right now that Orban acts the same like Erdolf aka Erdogan. The last hungarian newspaper that reported about the criminal acts of the Orban family, the ""Npszabadsg"" was closed down, freedom of the press is almost terminated now. And those EU puppets send taxmoney to such states and get nothing but problems back, but dont even try to stop such Hobby Hitlers. Good that Erdolfistan is not in the EU like hungaria and the other ""want revenge from russia"" liliputh states. And the people that elected Orban, just for anti-refugee and othe Nazi reasons, for nothing else? Another year under Orban and they will end as refugees in western europe! That will become embarrassing for the anti-refugee masses... To come to an end. Its obvisiously the ""west"" who is playing foul, playing foul and nothing else than that, at least since 9/11. The anglo-american axis(the modern mass surveillance pioneers) is surrounding russia, not russia the ""west""(and is using its idiot european ""partners"" for this). Its not russia that covers every part of the world with his military and his eavesdrop stations. Its not russia that ""owns"" almost unsinkable aircraft carries like Germany(38.500 US troops in germany), for example. Its not russia that stores nuke in germany, that we germans arent even allowed to own or store on our territory. The NSA isnt russian. TTIP, CETA, NAFTA, TISA and all that, isnt russian. The bankster crash 2008 was not based in russia. The robber baron capitalism that ""feeds"" a few but exploits 99,9% is not coming from communism(though they learned fast how it works).

Putin: stupid and unrealistic claims of impending war,"link a reply to: Profusion I must point out to you, that his statements are accurate. What is more, they are entirely appropriate to the situation. As we speak, proxy war is being fought by the destabilising forces of IS, sponsored by Western nations and interests by the back door, against the Assad regime. That regime is an ally of Russia. I am tired of pointing these things out, but to suggest that Russia is the problem, when for most of the last two decades, there has been western sponsored terrorism all over the most volatile region of the planet, smacks to me of the most unutterable witlessness. Russia is not the problem. I would not go as far as to say that it never was, and lets face it, the Russian government are not clean handed. But here is the thing... Russia cannot dishonour the British. It cannot dishonour the Americans. It can only make choices that make its nation look bad, and many of the choices it has made, with specific regard to its ACTUAL war effort against terror in Syria, have been absolutely legitimate, especially since they were not the cause of the problems there in the least. No... only OUR nations governments can dishonour us, and dishonour us they do. Every gun that makes its way from America and Britain, into the hands of a terrorist, dishonours us. Every time those weapons we sell the terrorists by the back door, are used to kill an innocent, we are dishonoured, stained with blood we would not wish to be shed. Our leaders, those of America and Britain not to mention other allies, THEY are the problem here. Their meddling, proxy warring, greed and hunger for power are the problem. They are the problem because we pay the taxes that make it possible. They are the problem because we did not give them permission to do these things in our name, because we would not want these things done in our name, and because they are supposed to be our representatives. No backstabbing, soft handed, work shy bastard represents me. No assemblage of schemers and game players represents me. No such mob represents my people on their best day, because on our best day the British people are not cold, evil, calculating and prepared to screw anyone to succeed. On our best day, even the least of us has more fair play and determination to do right than our government have. The same can be said a thousand fold for the leadership of the United States. We are not evil people, and yet we have allowed evil people to usurp the purpose of the tithe taken from our labour, to turn our effort, sweat and blood, into bloodshed overseas. We have had enemies made for us, by people we have mindlessly elected to positions with which they cannot be trusted. And we have the gall to be concerned about RUSSIA? I despair, I absolutely despair! This is not a game, this is not politics, this is real life. We should be doing better with it, and we are not. We should not be sliding ever further to the right, and yet we are. We should not be accepting the programming, and yet that is precisely what is happening all over the world, and in the OP of this very post. We MUST take back control of our governments. We MUST prevent our leaders from continuing these outmoded concepts of proxy war and destabilisation. We MUST mend the things our leaders broke in our name, we MUST take responsibility for those things, and we must NEVER allow them to happen again. In the meantime, we must leave Russia to deal with the crisis in Syria, so that the nation can be rebuilt, its infrastructure repaired, its homes and cities bought back to a livable state, and so that we are not distracted by a war that could turn from a pantomime into an even greater tragedy than it already is. I tire of this bizarre and ridiculous charade that we are apparently too stupid to stop, too uncaring to prevent. It needs to end, and end today, yesterday, TEN DAMNED YEARS AGO OR MORE! Can we stop accepting the lies, the obfuscations, the programming we have been fed? Can we PLEASE start doing that as a group? Would that be too damned much to ask? Because to be quite frank, if we cannot even do that, then we deserve to burn in nuclear fire for a hundred years, because we are not going to do ourselves any favours continuing such a pathetic existence as our leaders have created for us, cattle like and willing to believe whatever we are told, except that the sound of the bolt gun ahead is anything to worry about. edit on 27-10-2016 by TrueBrit because: grammatical error correction.",FAKE
"Conspiracy Theories deliverd to your door, anonymously.","link My first introduction to the world of conspiracy theories was a DVD I found while on vacation visiting my girlfriend in Kent, Ohio.

Universe is a hologram/virtual reality - But why?

We know that we as humans have the right to live and have family's, often with as many kids as sustainable (at the time). This means that however well we create food, we WILL use up all resources on this planet weather we make the best plans or not. But we cant crack viable ways to leave this planet and populate others beyond our own slowly decaying star. So what about this. What if the answer was to create a sped up reality, using all our computing and programming powers to emulate the universe (or observable universe), wait for life to grow on a planet and then give them the same problem we have so that we can reap the answer for ourselves?

Tom deLonge: Changing the cynical views of youth towards government,"link IMO, here is what is happening. you guys are jumping to conclusions by not having any context and taking this at face value. I've been into this a very long time, and with that perspective I see some repeating patterns. To the point of the op, this is the same old same old--with a new generation of players. We've seen the same exact thing over the last 70 years with people like George Adamski, David Fry, Billy Meier, William Moore, and Steven Greer. It's the same story: A privileged individual is given the keys to open a few doors about what ""really is happening."" Tom DeLonge believes (and that's all it takes) he has been given these keys, and he's running with it, as his handlers knew he would. Tom sees this whole ""Sekret Machines"" schtick as a ""franchise."" That's how he talks about it. when he says ""franchise"" he's talking in George Lucas Star Wars terms with movie tie-ins, merchandise, graphic novels, coffee cups, t-shirts, and back packs. That's his vision for this. He sees opportunity to make this thing BIG. Now, he's been writing to Podesta and who knows who else, but he and we know Podesta has an interest in UFOs. So Podesta is seen by Tom as an ""in"" for what he perceives as the new administration and he is offering himself as a legitimate representative of his generation. His statement to Podesta is one of POSITIONING HIMSELF as a natural go-between for these issues--especially with ""young people."" It has nothing really to do with young people being disenfranchised and cynical and everything to do with Tom DeLonge taking an important position vis-a-vis ""Disclosure."" If DeLonge pulls this off it won't be Stephen Bassett of the Paradigm Research Group or Steven Greer, who ""once had dinner with the head of the CIA"" whose name is forever associated with ""Disclosure."" The name everyone will remember is Tom DeLonge. THAT'S what is happening here. DeLonge is attempting to position himself to take major advantage of what he now thinks is reality, and which also includes a major Star-Wars-sized ""franchise"" that has the potential of turning him from a mere multi-millionaire into something much larger.

I am also sure that this may not be the best place to make any form of impact as let's be honest. I do not think many muslim's reside on this website and if they do, then I am sure they will defend their side just as usual. Tommy Robinson (also known as Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon) is the co-founder and leader of the English Defence League. Some of you who know this man may already, may have opinions about him because of his creation of the EDL and what some of its members have been known to behave like. However, Tommy Robinson in my eyes is one of the very few, if not the only person to stand up to the islamist movement in this country. It is a good thing he is around whether you respect him or not as islamists have one thing in common, they have a lot to loose and also a lot to gain either way. Just like anyone that stands up to a movement like islam, its always a difficult one. Considering England has been asleep for to long to even notice what is going on under its nose. Everyone thinks England is promoting multiculturalism by allowing Islam to move freely within this country but islam and its ways are not to get along peacefully, they want western cultures out completely. If left to their own devices, England will be taken over within 10 - 20 years or sooner. Here is a short video of Tommy Robinson travelling through his local town and regardless of him being the main man of the EDL he is not being abusive to anyone yet this is the kind of treatment a born and raised English man gets in his own home town. As you can tell in the video above. Disgusting behaviour by disgusting people who are using their faith as a scape goat to instil fear, scaremonger and literally drive out English people from there home towns. How? Because people of England are sitting back and not sharing their fears about such extremism in their own country. Also a big shame is that the younger generation are being taught to accept anyone and everyone and although this is a beautiful message to portray this is the root cause of Islam continuing to grow. You will see in many debates get side tracked by blank statements made by younger generations about such political points only to end up with a nonsensical opinion that gets us nowhere. The older generation are tired of fighting, so we have only this moment in time to get those capable, those noticing changes in the UK and America and many other places to realise what is occurring before there is no one of the right age to know how things have changed. Desensitisation is the worry here. There is so much to cover a topic like this could last pages and pages, however I just want to point out a few things. The rest should be up to conversation. The current state of moderate muslims is not a thing. A muslim lives by the faith of Islam and if they had to side with one or the other, they would side with Islam. This should be cause of concern because even though they deem themselves not the same or as severe, they are in fact, just as severe. Basically they are sleeper cells being created within our very own country. They are not here to live peacefully along side us either. They are here to promote their faith and grow, growing means pushing more and more on other faiths that for many years have lived together, peacefully. Only until now, has this country had problems like this. I am not here to promote Tommy Robinson but I am here to state that this mans points should be heard. If you have the time now or again, give this video below a watch. He explains very well where things have gone, are going and will end up. Not just in the UK but everywhere in the world that does nothing about this. edit on 27-10-2016 by BlackProject because: (no reason given)",FAKE
NASA's gateway to deep space,"NASAs gateway to deep space page: 1 www.abovetopsecret.com... Now, it sems that NASA is making good on his promise and is moving forward with the plan by establishing a Deep-Space Habitat near the Moon to test out systems for people who would live in orbit or travel long distances in Space; a gateway to deep space NASA plans to address its problem by parking a deep space habitat in a location near the Moon, which astronauts could visit and use to become acclimated to life beyond low-Earth orbit. President Obama mentioned deep space habitats earlier this month, when he reiterated his call for NASA to send humans to Mars. I'm excited to announce that we are working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space, Obama said. This wasnt really a new announcement, as NASA has been working on the habitat program for a couple of years. Nevertheless, before the president's mention, this NextSTEP program had received surprisingly little attention given its significanceit might be the most important contract NASA awards for next decade. As Obama said, NASA has embarked upon a ""Journey to Mars."" While the plan may change to include lunar landings as a stepping stone to Mars, the space agency does intend to try and venture back into deep space for the first time since the Apollo program. Whatever destination it chooses, NASA's ambitions will begin with the deep space habitat, because it is an affordable first step, costing hundreds of millions or a few billion dollars initially, instead of multiple billions needed for a full-blown expedition to the Moon's surface, Mars or elsewhere in deep space. ""This is the right next step,"" Simon said. ""We need to understand how to live in deep space, how to live off of our planet."" The first habitat launched in the 2020s wont be exactly the same as the vehicle NASA eventually sends to Mars. Rather, it will serve as a prototype to help the space agency understand the capabilities, technologies, and systems needed for astronauts to survive for long periods in deep space. Some of those systems can be tested on the ground or the existing space station, but others can only be tested further from Earth. This venture is part of the Next step program initiated by NASA: www.nasa.gov... NextSTEP is a public-private partnership model that seeks commercial development of deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human space flight missions in the Proving Ground around and beyond cislunar spacethe space near Earth that extends just beyond the moon. So far, NASA has partnered with 6 companies in this effort: Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation, and NanoRacks. This is great, ATS! I am very excited at this news, even with all of the morbidity we have in the world today; I'm still excited for the future..! This is an ambitious plan..can US aerospace companies pull this off alone, or should this be more of a global effort? What does ATS think?",FAKE

Yet its also true that for Americans who dont get insurance through work, and who make too much money to qualify for federal subsidies, the cost of health coverage is about to soar dramatically, with premiums sometimes rising $1,000, even over $2,000 for the year. If one were making 45k per year and the cost of a service increased 1k-2k for THAT year one would find other service providers or not use the service at all. But if you did not pay for health insurance you would owe the irs a penalty of 2k.

Planet Nine,"link I want to preface this by saying there is no ""Planet X"" IMO as pertains to the views of such a planet that many on this board hold. However, I have always felt there was a massive missing planet as we could never satisfactorily explain perturbations of a planet like Jupiter and the movement of outer objects. The view that there is a missing massive planet has always been on the table and NASA has always supported the idea and never stood in the way of people trying to find proof of it. We know planets, often many, orbit stars in this outer region, why should we be different? Link: Planet X Overview, Source: NASA Caltech researchers have found evidence suggesting there may be a ""Planet X"" deep in the solar system. This hypothetical Neptune-sized planet orbits our sun in a highly elongated orbit far beyond Pluto. The object, which the researchers have nicknamed ""Planet Nine,"" could have a mass about 10 times that of Earth and orbit about 20 times farther from the sun on average than Neptune. It may take between 10,000 and 20,000 Earth years to make one full orbit around the sun. But this is all from January you might say, quite old and possibly already discussed. Fast forward to my news feed for today and what do I find? Narrowing the field for the 9th planet Batygin and Brown's work narrowed down the planets possible mass and orbit to areas where previous observations might have missed it. Their calculations suggest that it has a mass between five to 20 times that of Eartha figure that is key to knowing the approximate size of the object they are looking for. They also suggest that its orbit is likely tilted about 30 degrees compared to the plane of the solar systemthe relatively thin, flat zone in which the eight major planets orbit. They also propose that the planet is now likely near its farthest point from the sun, in the sky's northern hemisphere, and that it likely has an elongated orbit averaging between 380 and 980 astronomical units (AU) from the sun. (One AU is the average distance between Earth and the sun.) We are on the virge of finding a very real planet in our outer solar system. They previsouly released this model for what the orbit could look like: And they've created 100+ more of those which have not yet been published. n an as-yet unpublished set of about 100 new high-resolution computer simulations, Batygin says he and Brown have narrowed down Planet Nine's location to a roughly 600- to 800-square degree patch of sky. The biggest piece of proof has turned out to be the very tilt of our solar system from the perspective of the inner planets. Bailey and her colleagues ran computer simulations that suggest that the tilt of the eight official planets can be explained by the gravitational influence of Planet Nine ""over the 4.5-billion-years-ish lifetime of the solar system,"" Bailey told Space.com.

"What is one more election thread, ehhh?","a reply to: kruphix Theocracy? Tim Kaine? In September 1980, as violence and civil war erupted throughout Central America, a quiet American left Harvard Law School to volunteer with Jesuit missionaries in northern Honduras. Around him, the United States-backed military dictatorship hunted Marxists and cracked down on the Catholic clergy for preaching empowerment to peasant farmers. But some locals also looked warily on the bearded and mop-haired Midwesterner in their midst. Just a few hours south, the Central Intelligence Agency was using Honduras as a staging ground in its covert war against Latin American communism, with right-wing forces training for operations in El Salvador and Nicaragua. Some of the people were wondering whats going on, who is this guy? Tim Kaine, then a 22-year-old volunteer and now the Democratic nominee for vice president, said in an interview. He understood why.

Far from being a C.I.A. operative, Mr. Kaine was a young Catholic at a crossroads, undergoing a spiritual shift as he awakened to the plight of the deeply poor in Honduras. In its far-flung pueblos, banana plantation company towns and dusty cities, Mr. Kaine embraced an interpretation of the gospel, known as liberation theology, that championed social change to improve the lives of the downtrodden. In Honduras, his recitation of the traditional Catholic mealtime blessing changed to Lord give bread to those who hunger, and hunger for justice to those who have bread. Honduran military leaders, American officials and even Pope John Paul II viewed liberation theology suspiciously, as dangerously injecting Marxist beliefs into religious teaching. But the strong social-justice message of liberation theology helped set Mr. Kaine on a left-veering career path in which he fought as a lawyer against housing discrimination, became a liberal mayor, and rose as a Spanish-speaking governor and senator with an enduring focus on Latin America.",FAKE

Well, yesterday on PBS Nevada Week In Review , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) was asked whether his goal was to move Obamacare to a single-payer system. His answer? Yes, yes. Absolutely, yes. The plan to undermine your health and sufficiency is so diabolical and disgusting, that many would simply refuse to believe such a thing. Well, there it is folks. They dont give a damn about you or your well-being and will do anything in their power to see that decisions about your health are made by them in the future.

UC Berkeley SJWS Build Human Wall to BLock White Students from Campus Nice Video in the link. They never actually say that whites were not allowed to cross the wall but you can clearly see in the video they let people of color through while making white students walk around. Pretty nuts. One more reason I don't believe in the education system. So many self entitled 20 year old toddlers who piss and moan when life gets rough. Then take it out on whitie and the police. What a joke. If they blocked me anybody who stood in my way would be eating blended meals through a straw for the next couple of months. The average human punch can generate 178 pounds of pressure or force. It takes 10 to 13 pounds to break a nose and 40 pounds to dislocate someones jaw. I have done both and im very good at it. Then to get to class, one may need to keep a rainbow kerchief or Cherokee flag handy and play a role. SJW racists are basically dolts and can be readily outwitted.",FAKE

GS has been a target of political activism for years. Now they can bank on Hillary protecting them. Goldman Sachs Endorses Hillary Clinton For President Hes with her. On Sunday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earned the endorsement of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfeinan endorsement she had been working toward for years. As was revealed by Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton spent the run up to her presidential campaign giving speeches to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, where she praised their talents and explained her positions on financial regulation. On October 24, 2013, Clinton told Goldman Sachs that Dodd-Frank had to be done mostly for political reasons because Congress needed to look like it was doing something about the crisis. She said, Theres nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry. The anti-Bernie anti-Thesis",FAKE
The Latest: Clinton to unveil anti-bullying plan,"A major new plan will be announced soon by the Hillary Campaign. This will certainly solve the world problems that face Humanity. She will tax the rich and pay hundreds of millions of dollars to states that fight bullies !!!! It's the anti-bully agenda to keep everybody's free speech and free thought on heel of the government. The greatness is astounding !!! The Latest: Clinton to unveil anti-bullying plan Hillary Clinton is unveiling a plan to reduce bullying. Called ""Better than Bullying,"" the plan released Thursday by the Democratic presidential nominee would provide $500 million in new funding to states that develop comprehensive anti-bullying efforts. Clinton is expected to talk about the plan during an appearance with first lady Michelle Obama Thursday. She has called Republican Donald Trump a bully for his derogatory comments. The campaign said states must address verbal and cyber bullying and establish a process for addressing incidents. They must also ban bullying on the ""basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, and religion."" States could get $4 dollars from the federal government for every $1 they spend. It would be paid for through Clinton's proposed tax increases on the wealthy.",FAKE

Democrats are Racist for Calling Black Trump Supporters Uneducated Red Necks,"Democrats are Racist for Calling Black Trump Supporters Uneducated Red Necks page: 1 link Its ok to call us white Trump supporters all that but when You mess with our black friends then that's another issue. Democrats need to realize that some black folks and white folks all grew up with different opportunities and school zones, that is SO RACIST to call them uneducated, its fine to call us whites that but not our black brothers and sisters, the Hispanics and all other non whites. How dare the Clintons offend our black and other minority members , Im sure some liberal will come along and say something totally ignorant like trump doesn't have and black supporters, well he does, over 20% of them. True, the democrats didn't single out the blacks and minorities, they referred to all of us as lots of things, all of us AMERICANS that weren't equal in our financial upbringings. You see, I see all of us Trump supporters as 3 colors, red white and blue. I see us all as Ameicans and not trying to DIVIDE people like the democrats.",FAKE
NASA to test in flight folding wing,"NASA to test in flight folding wing page: 1 link NASA is set to begin testing a new wing design that would change shape in flight, bending up or down, to increase yaw stability, reduce required rudder size, and decrease drag. The Boeing 777X is set to introduce wingtips that fold on the ground, to allow the aircraft to fit in existing gates with a longer wingspan. NASA is set to begin testing the Spanwise Adaptive Wing, which would add shape-memory alloy actuators to the wingtip area that would bend the tips up or down. The SMA actuators would activate when heated electrically, so there is no need for complex hydraulic lines or actuators. Beginning in Spring of 2017, NASA will start flying the Area-I PTERA UAV. It has a 176 inch wingspan, with the outer 15 inches moving as far as 75 degrees up or down. PTERA is not set up for SAW, but it appears that it could see a 40% rudder authority. The idea behind SAW is similar to what was done with the XB-70, with the wingtips angled down. Boeing will introduce folding wings to commercial aviation when the 777X airliner enters service at the end of 2019. But the devices could become commonplace on future aircraft as wingspans increase in an effort to reduce drag and fuel burn. The 777X has almost 24 ft. more wingspan than todays 777 to optimize lift distribution and maximize cruise efficiency. Folding the tips on the ground keeps the larger aircraft compatible with existing taxiway and gate size restrictions. But NASA is investigating whether also folding the wing in flight could save still more fuel. The Spanwise Adaptive Wing (SAW) concept will be tested on the ground and in flight in a rapid feasibility assessment under NASAs new Convergent Aeronautics Solutions project. The goal is to show that angling the outboard wing sections up or down can increase yaw stability and control, and reduce rudder size and tail drag.",FAKE
Assange - Hillary will win and tried to hack Wikileaks,"link So this is from an Argentinian conference Assange spoke with via telephone. He states Hillary campaign (or pro-Hillary government) attempted to attack Wikileaks servers. Assange claimed the release whipped up a crazed hornets nest atmosphere in the Hillary Clinton campaign leading them to attack WikiLeaks. They attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the UN and British courts to accuse me of being both a Russian spy and a pedophile, he added. He also added that he does not think the Podesta emails will have an impact, adding the influence of MSM pushing Hillary. The Podesta emails will make no difference to the election result, according to Assange. I dont think theres any chance of Donald Trump winning the election, even with the amazing material we are publishing, because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with Hillary Clinton, he said. sorry this is RT, but many won't cover this Interesting considering he implied he would have a bombshell before the election. This whole situation is so hard to read, with talks of Wikileaks being compromised, or pressure on to Ecuador trickling down to Assange. Just thought I'd share.",FAKE
