      "bodyText": "A landmark case pitting the Great Barrier Reef against Adani\u2019s proposed Carmichael coalmine begins in the federal court on Tuesday. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) is arguing that environment minister Greg Hunt unlawfully approved the mine in central Queensland, which would be the largest in Australia. They will argue the emissions released when the coal from the mine is burned will put the world heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef at risk by exacerbating climate change. The case begins in Brisbane amid the worst bleaching event the Great Barrier Reef has ever experienced, with 93% of the reefs seeing damage \u2013 something directly caused by climate change. Scientists warned last week that the bleaching event was made 175 times more likely because of climate change, and the conditions that caused it would be commonplace in less than 20 years, putting the continued existence of the reef in doubt. When the minister approves a project under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act, he must act consistently with Australia\u2019s obligations under the world heritage convention. That requires Australia do everything it can to protect the \u201coutstanding universal values\u201d of world heritage areas, including the Great Barrier Reef. \u201cIf the Carmichael mine is allowed to proceed its coal will produce 128.4m tonnes of CO2 per year at peak production, contributing to the world\u2019s climate problem,\u201d said ACF\u2019s chief executive Kelly O\u2019Shanassy out the front of the court in Queensland. Environmental approvals of mines usually consider the emissions caused in the production of the coal \u2013 from the fuel burned by trucks and the electricity used by the equipment. But in the past they have not considered the impact of the greenhouse gasses released when the coal itself is burned. The ACF\u2019s case will test the section of the federal environment law that requires the minister to act consistently with Australia\u2019s obligations under the world heritage convention. If successful, the case will have ramifications beyond the Carmichael mine or even the Great Barrier Reef. It could have implications for any fossil fuel development, and require the minister to consider the effect of the burned fuel on any world heritage area \u2013 like the forests in Tasmania, for example. \u201cThis is the first case of its kind to be heard in Australia,\u201d said O\u2019Shanassy. \u201cThe court will be asked to examine a section of Australia\u2019s national environment law that has never before been tested in court. If this case is successful it will strengthen climate change considerations and world heritage protection in Australian law.\u201d The hearing at the federal court in Brisbane is expected to go for two days. Hunt and Adani will be represented.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "1) Eden Hazard makes true on his promise What a cruel way for Tottenham to concede the title. The pubs across Leicester will not have cared but, of all players, it had to be Eden Hazard who sealed it. Mauricio Pochettino put his hand to his face as Hazard curled in the equaliser with eight minutes remaining, a brilliant finish to hand Leicester their first league title despite being 5,000-1 shots with the bookmakers at the beginning of the season. Hazard scored twice against Bournemouth last week \u2013 his first goals since May last season \u2013 and said along with Cesc F\u00e0bregas after that match that he would like nothing more than to end Tottenham\u2019s title hopes. He did not start here but came on for Pedro at half-time and did very little until curling a shot precisely past Hugo Lloris in the closing stages. A decisive impact to crush Tottenham hearts. 2) Will clubs face retrospective action? This was a tempestuous and ill-tempered match and both clubs could be punished by the Football Association in the days to come. There were two brawls of major significance, the first coming at the end of the first half when Pochettino decided to intervene in an attempt to stop Danny Rose and Willian coming to blows. That resulted in a m\u00eal\u00e9e but there was further controversy to come at the final whistle. With Chelsea having shattered Spurs\u2019 title hopes, tension was high. As the players walked towards the tunnel there was more pushing and shoving, with both coaches in the thick of it and F\u00e0bregas ushered towards the dressing rooms. Guus Hiddink said afterwards that most of the insults were in Spanish, while Pochettino refused to criticise his players for their conduct. However, both Spurs and Chelsea could face FA charges of failing to control their players. 3) Did Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 poke Diego Costa\u2019s eye? When Pochettino decided to jump in and separate Danny Rose and Willian shortly before half-time, all hell seemed to break loose for a few moments as tensions rose rapidly inside Stamford Bridge. Blue and white shirts came running towards the dugouts from all areas of the pitch and, amid the chaos of players and coaching staff jostling and shouting, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Costa were involved in an altercation. One moment that was caught by the TV cameras but not seemingly seen by the officials was Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s hand thrust into the face of Costa. It looked like an attempt at an eye poke from the Belgian and an incident that could potentially result in retrospective disciplinary action for the Belgian. With Dele Alli already out until the end of the season following his punch against West Bromwich Albion\u2019s Claudio Yacob, losing Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 to suspension would be another major blow for Tottenham. 4) Harry Kane performance not enough Amid all the deserved recognition for Leicester City\u2019s stunning individual performances this season, Harry Kane\u2019s remarkable campaign has not been celebrated as it might. Kane was named in the PFA Team of the Year but, with Riyad Mahrez winning the PFA Player of the Year award and Jamie Vardy the football writers\u2019 equivalent, the Tottenham forward has missed out on the top gongs. In another year Kane could have swept the board and there has not been a season quite like this from an English centre-forward in recent memory. Here he scored his 25th Premier League goal of the season with an exquisitely timed run and composed finish in the first half, but it was not enough. He bullied John Terry and Gary Cahill at times but could not quite lead his side to victory. 5) Officials have their hands full This was always going to be a frenetic match played at a high-octane pace and, for the referee, Mark Clattenburg, and his assistants, one that required a sharp eye with the world watching. Clattenburg was certainly lenient early on and it was remarkable that the first booking came in the 27th minute. A further 11 followed, nine in all for Spurs, which is a Premier League record for a single team. Clattenburg decided not to sanction Pochettino for stepping on to the pitch and it is pertinent to wonder whether he could have done anything differently, or perhaps the stakes were so high and the animosity between the clubs such that this was always going to be a fiery match. One key, correct decision was assistant Jake Collins\u2019 to rule Harry Kane onside for the opening goal.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mauricio Pochettino refused to criticise his Tottenham players despite his side receiving nine bookings in the 2-2 draw with Chelsea and with both clubs facing potential retrospective conduct sanctions from the Football Association. Spurs\u2019 title hopes were abruptly ended following a tempestuous match in which 12 players were booked by the referee, Mark Clattenburg. Tottenham\u2019s nine yellow cards is a Premier League record for a single match on a night when ferocious and reckless challenges were frequent. Shortly before half-time Pochettino stepped in between Danny Rose and Willian, resulting in a mass m\u00eal\u00e9e by the touchline. During the chaos Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 appeared to poke the eye of Chelsea\u2019s Diego Costa and the Belgian may face retrospective action if the officials did not see the incident. At the final whistle there was an even bigger brawl by the tunnel between almost every player, both managers and a significant number of both backroom staffs. Both clubs could be charged with failing to control their players. Pochettino, though, did not criticise his side despite their approach. The Argentinian said: \u201cIt was a derby, we were fighting to win the title and Chelsea were fighting to try and win. We were all involved. When you play for the title and play a big team like Chelsea, they want to win. It was normal emotion, fighting on the pitch is not a good example, for both teams. \u201cIn football we want to win and sometimes situations like tonight happen. I think there is nothing to say, nothing to blame, how they [Chelsea] take the game shows big respect for us. That makes us feel proud. \u201cOur players are disappointed and sad, we need to feel that for the future. We are the youngest squad in the Premier League and to be in this position is fantastic. Now we need to focus to keep our place and finish second.\u201d Asked if Tottenham\u2019s players had crossed the line, Pochettino added: \u201cMaybe yes but we need to see the video. On the touchline is hard to observe the situations.\u201d The Chelsea manager, Guus Hiddink, revealed there were some scratches on Costa\u2019s face and said most of the insults being thrown were in Spanish, with Cesc F\u00e0bregas involved. \u201cOf course it was a very emotional and hectic game,\u201d said Hiddink. \u201cAt the end highly emotional, there was a bit of verbal animosity and I tried to come in between and protect a bit and go into the locker room. We shuffled a bit on the benches. \u201cI took F\u00e0bregas, I tried to get him down [the tunnel], because there were some words in Spanish and I understand Spanish. Threatening a bit. There became more people involved and we shuffled around. \u201cThere was a lot at stake for them, and for us prestige at stake. An emotional game between two big clubs. I had to come in between a lot of people today. It normally happens a lot in the Latin world. Steve [Holland, the Chelsea coach] got very emotional. We are not the most beautiful boys, let\u2019s be honest. It\u2019s a fight and there\u2019s frustration, losing the championship. It\u2019s difficult.\u201d",

In this astonishing season, now embellished with its 5,000-1 champions, how Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 made it all the way to stoppage time before he was booked might be the greatest miracle of all. In the dying moments of the first half, after Danny Rose slid in late on Willian in front of the Spurs dug-out, players and coaches from both sides came together in a m\u00eal\u00e9e that distracted the officials sufficiently for the Belgian to push his nails into one of Diego Costa\u2019s eyes and down his face and emerge unnoticed and unpunished. Costa is used to winning trophies and being unpleasantly aggressive to others; here it was he who was bullied, and then he helped present a trophy to someone else. Earlier Kyle Walker had pushed Pedro to the floor and then kicked him, gently but deliberately, in the shin. And so it continued. \u00c9rik Lamela, booked early in the first half for a two-footed foul on Cesc F\u00e0bregas, later appeared to tread on the Spaniard\u2019s hand. Of Tottenham\u2019s outfield players, by the end only Toby Alderweireld had not been booked and it would be a surprise if Dele Alli, retrospectively banned from this and Tottenham\u2019s remaining two top-flight fixtures after punching a player in their previous game, did not have company on the sidelines as Spurs\u2019 season peters out \u2013 potentially quite a lot of company. Guus Hiddink spoke afterwards about how these bad-tempered occasions \u201chappen a lot in the Latin world\u201d, alluding perhaps to Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham\u2019s Argentinian manager, who twice entered the pitch to get involved in the bad-tempered action, at one stage had to be separated from Steve Holland, Chelsea\u2019s assistant first-team coach, and was at the centre of the post-match brawl, which began when Hiddink attempted to chaperone F\u00e0bregas past him and down the tunnel (the Dutchman, who speaks Spanish, said later that his player was being threatened in the language). Pochettino has fashioned a young and vibrant team and minutes after the game\u2019s end spoke calmly and genially to the media, but he showed here that the spirit of Antonio Rattin, famously, furiously sent off in a World Cup quarter-final 50 years ago and eight miles away, lives within him. \u201cIt\u2019s football,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are men, they are men and we need to show we are strong.\u201d The irony is that it was supposed to be Chelsea who were motivated by spite. There was little for them to play for but professional pride \u2013 which has not always been evident in their performances this season \u2013 and a refusal to cede the title they won a year ago to local rivals. It proved motivation enough, with Eden Hazard, whose assertion that \u201cwe don\u2019t want Tottenham to win the league, if we can beat them it will be good\u201d, represented the apotheosis of the pre-match trolling, coming off the bench wonderfully to complete their comeback from a two-goal half-time deficit. There was a moment before kick-off, as a giant \u201cPride of London\u201d banner was carried across the Shed End by Chelsea\u2019s fans, when it was tempting to wonder if they would continue passing it around the stadium until it reached the other end. Failing that, perhaps they could be tempted to stuff it into a large bag and hide it in a cupboard for the foreseeable future. There is, after all, a shelf in the club\u2019s trophy cabinet that has just become available. But within this performance Chelsea\u2019s players showed that perhaps they share with their fans a desire to wrest back the status they have so emphatically and humiliatingly lost this season. Of course, there were always three teams in this marriage. As Asmir Begovic prepared to take the free-kick, deep on Chelsea\u2019s left-wing, that followed Walker\u2019s first, early foul on Pedro, a fan in the front row immediately behind him held up a placard that read, \u201cLet\u2019s do it for Ranieri\u201d.

    "webTitle": "Universal credit reduced to cost-cutting exercise by Treasury, say experts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The future of the government\u2019s biggest public sector reform programme, universal credit, rests \u201con a knife edge\u201d because Treasury cuts have reduced it to an exercise in cost-cutting, potentially leaving millions of working families worse off, experts have warned. The original aim of universal credit (UC) \u2013 to encourage people to work more hours by letting them keep more of their low wage top-ups as their income rises \u2013 has been watered down so much that it risks failing to achieve its original purpose, according to the Resolution thinktank. Resolution, which is chaired by the former Conservative MP Lord Willetts, urged ministers to \u201creclaim\u201d the troubled policy from the Treasury by correcting its serious design flaws and improving its generosity to claimants. \u201cThe suspicion is that UC has shifted from becoming a vehicle of genuine reform designed to improve jobs and and earnings prospects for lower income workers to a simple exercise in cost-cutting. Any shift must be reversed,\u201d it said in analysis published on Tuesday. It said the majority of low-paid working families would be \u201cdetrimentally affected\u201d by Treasury changes to UC, even when other government policies such as the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, cuts to income tax, and extra free childcare for three and four-year-olds are factored in. On current projections, Resolution estimates that the 1.2 million families who are in receipt of tax credits will no longer be entitled to any help under UC, leaving them \u00a341 a week worse off, while a further 1.3 million will qualify for UC, but will be an average of \u00a346 a week worse off. About 2 million families will be \u00a334 a week better off. The report says: \u201cAny ambition for supporting and rewarding work and progression looks very hard to achieve under the revised proposals. Indeed, even the welcome progress made over the last 15 years under the tax credit system is at risk of being dismantled.\u201d The warning comes as the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) claimed it was on course to deliver its commitment to \u201crevolutionise welfare\u201d through UC. It announced it had reached the \u201chistoric milestone\u201d of making UC available to single claimants in every UK jobcentre and was preparing a phased rollout to all claimants, including families with children. The rollout of the so-called \u201cfull service\u201d across the UK will start this month for all new claimants in jobcentres in Newcastle upon Tyne, Lowestoft, Rugby, Bath, and Bridgewater, and will take more than two years to complete. The gradual shift of all existing tax credit and benefit claimants on to universal credit is not expected to be finalised until 2021. Stephen Crabb, the work and pensions secretary, said: \u201cUC is transforming welfare and is central to our vision for our society where people of all backgrounds can earn a decent wage and provide for their families, with claimants moving into work faster and earning more than under the old system. Our focus now is on continuing its expansion to all claimants.\u201d However, Resolution said Treasury reductions to work allowances in UC announced by the chancellor, George Osborne, a year ago meant that any gains originally envisaged by UC may now be outweighed by the likely pain and effort of implementing it. The work allowance changes are forecast to bring the exchequer \u00a33bn a year in savings by 2021. The first impact of these will be felt in the next couple of weeks by tens of thousands of working families already on UC who were told in April they would lose up to \u00a3200 a month as a result. The thinktank also warned that in-work conditionality, whereby low-paid working UC claimants would be expected to prove to DWP officials they were seeking to earn more by working longer hours or taking a second job, as a condition of receiving the benefit, would be controversial. Last month the Guardian revealed a full-time bar worker was fined \u00a3220 after she missed a jobcentre appointment to go on a family holiday. The fate of UC, which is several years behind its original schedule after delays caused by management failings and IT design problems, has been the subject of speculation since its champion, the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, resigned in March after years of clashes with the Treasury. Just over 200,000 people claim UC, instead of the 4 million anticipated at this point back in 2014. However, his successor\u2019s early pronouncements suggest the DWP for now remains committed to the scheme, which bundles six current benefits into a single payment, and will, if it stays on schedule, account for \u00a353bn of social security spending by 2021. Owen Smith, the shadow work and pension secretary, said: \u201cThis report confirms the devastating impact of Tory cuts to universal credit that will leave 2.5 million working families over \u00a32,100 a year worse off. This will completely undermine the work incentives that were supposed to be at the heart of universal credit.\u201d Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: \u201cUniversal credit looked good on the drawing board but round after round of big Treasury cuts have reduced its ability to help people get better off through earnings. \u201cFor all the claims for its revolutionising powers, the cuts to universal credit will actually hit working families\u2019 budgets as hard as the now abandoned tax credit cuts would have. The cuts have weakened work incentives and reduced the gains from work for these families.\u201d",

Any shift must be reversed,\u201d it said in analysis published on Tuesday.</p> <p>It said the majority of low-paid working families would be \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/14/dwp-punishing-low-paid-full-time-workers-under-new-benefits-rule\">detrimentally affected</a>\u201d by Treasury changes to UC, even when other government policies such as the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/01/the-national-living-wage-and-what-it-means\">national living wage</a>\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/16/budget-2016-osbornes-giveaways-mask-56bn-black-hole\">cuts to income tax</a>, and extra <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jun/01/childcare-free-nurseries-challenge-david-cameron-pledge-double\">free childcare for three and four-year-olds</a> are factored in. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2016/apr/22/universal-credit-tough-love-for-low-paid-workers\">Universal credit: tough love for low-paid workers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On current projections, Resolution estimates that the 1.2 million families who are in receipt of tax credits will no longer be entitled to any help under UC, leaving them \u00a341 a week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/10/universal-credit-cuts-to-lose-low-income-families-up-to-200-a-month\">worse off</a>, while a further 1.3 million will qualify for UC, but will be an average of \u00a346 a week worse off. About 2 million families will be \u00a334 a week better off.</p> <p>The report says: \u201cAny ambition for supporting and rewarding work and progression looks very hard to achieve under the revised proposals. Indeed, even the welcome progress made over the last 15 years under the tax credit system is at risk of being dismantled.\u201d</p> <p>The warning comes as the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) claimed it was on course to deliver its commitment to \u201crevolutionise welfare\u201d through UC. It announced it had reached the \u201chistoric milestone\u201d of making UC available to single claimants in every UK jobcentre and was preparing a phased rollout to all claimants, including families with children. </p> <p>The rollout of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/499726/transition-rollout-schedule-phase-1-to-2-2016.pdf\">so-called \u201cfull service\u201d</a> across the UK will start this month for all new claimants in jobcentres in Newcastle upon Tyne, Lowestoft, Rugby, Bath, and Bridgewater, and will take more than two years to complete. The gradual shift of all existing tax credit and benefit claimants on to universal credit is not expected to be finalised until 2021.</p> <p>Stephen Crabb, the work and pensions secretary, said: \u201cUC is transforming welfare and is central to our vision for our society where people of all backgrounds can earn a decent wage and provide for their families, with claimants moving into work faster and earning more than under the old system. Our focus now is on continuing its expansion to all claimants.\u201d</p> <p>However, Resolution said Treasury <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/25/so-osborne-scrapped-tax-credit-cuts-but-what-of-universal-credit\">reductions to work allowances</a> in UC announced by the chancellor, George Osborne, a year ago meant that any gains originally envisaged by UC may now be outweighed by the likely pain and effort of implementing it. The work allowance changes are forecast to bring the exchequer \u00a33bn a year in savings by 2021.</p> <p>The first impact of these will be felt in the next couple of weeks by tens of thousands of working families already on UC who were told in April they would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/10/universal-credit-cuts-to-lose-low-income-families-up-to-200-a-month\">lose up to \u00a3200 a month</a> as a result. </p> <p>The thinktank also warned that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2016/apr/22/universal-credit-tough-love-for-low-paid-workers\">in-work conditionality</a>, whereby low-paid working UC claimants would be expected to prove to DWP officials they were seeking to earn more by working longer hours or taking a second job, as a condition of receiving the benefit, would be controversial. Last month the Guardian revealed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/14/dwp-punishing-low-paid-full-time-workers-under-new-benefits-rule\">a full-time bar worker was fined \u00a3220</a> after she missed a jobcentre appointment to go on a family holiday.</p> <p>The fate of UC, which is several years behind its original schedule after delays caused by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/19/universal-credit-failings-pac-accuses-dwp\">management failings</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/05/universal-credit-iain-duncan-smith\">IT design problems</a>, has been the subject of speculation since its champion, the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/20/how-the-iain-duncan-smith-resignation-crisis-unfolded\">resigned in March</a> after years of clashes with the Treasury. Just over 200,000 people claim UC, instead of the 4 million anticipated at this point back in 2014. </p> <p>However, his successor\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/12/stephen-crabb-relentless-focus-improving-life-chances-welfare-universal-credit\">early pronouncements</a> suggest the DWP for now remains committed to the scheme, which bundles six current benefits into a single payment, and will, if it stays on schedule, account for \u00a353bn of social security spending by 2021.</p> <p>Owen Smith, the shadow work and pension secretary, said: \u201cThis report confirms the devastating impact of Tory cuts to universal credit that will leave 2.5 million working families over \u00a32,100 a year worse off. This will completely undermine the work incentives that were supposed to be at the heart of universal credit.\u201d</p> <p>Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: \u201cUniversal credit looked good on the drawing board but round after round of big Treasury cuts have reduced its ability to help people get better off through earnings. </p> <p>\u201cFor all the claims for its revolutionising powers, the cuts to universal credit will actually hit working families\u2019 budgets as hard as the now abandoned tax credit cuts would have. The cuts have weakened work incentives and reduced the gains from work for these families.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Worries about the EU referendum in June, rising labour costs and China\u2019s slowdown have knocked UK business confidence to a four-year low, according to a report that will fan fears the economy is losing momentum. A poll of 1,000 chartered accountants by their professional body, the ICAEW, echoed other recent surveys pointing to fragile consumer and business confidence as the referendum approaches. The poll also noted a slowdown in domestic sales and nervousness about hiring new staff. The main reading on the ICAEW/Grant Thornton UK business confidence monitor dropped to 0.8 from 11.4 in the previous quarter and was the lowest since early 2012 when economic growth was grinding to a halt. The report pointed to several factors weighing on sentiment and predicted economic growth will slow further in the coming months. The latest official data showed GDP growth had already dipped to 0.4% in the first quarter from 0.6% in the final three months of 2015. \u201cBusiness confidence is fragile and there is an absence of resilience in the UK economy at the moment. A combination of factors has led to this negativity and includes the EU referendum, slowing domestic sales, Chinese growth slackening and the recent budget,\u201d said the ICAEW chief executive, Michael Izza. \u201cBusinesses cannot plan with confidence and this applies regardless of sector, ownership or size of company. Weakening growth will also mean lower tax receipts for the chancellor, making it even harder for him to meet his deficit goal.\u201d The group said the latest drop in confidence suggested GDP will expand just 0.3% in the second April-to-June quarter. That chimes with a recent Bank of England prediction that growth will likely falter as companies defer spending decisions until after the 23 June referendum, which polls suggest will be close run. The survey of chartered accountants found companies\u2019 export sales had improved thanks to a weaker pound, which makes UK goods cheaper for overseas buyers. But it said sales growth in the UK had \u201cslowed significantly\u201d. It highlighted new costs for employers from the recently introduced national living wage and auto-enrolment rules on pensions. The poll found skill shortages were less of a problem for businesses than 12 months ago but that employment was expected to slow this year. Salaries were predicted to rise by 2% over the next year. There were further signs of pay pressures in separate figures showing salaries listed in job adverts had flatlined in March. The jobs search website Adzuna said political uncertainty appeared to be making employers more cautious as it reported that the average advertised salary was \u00a333,815 in March, unchanged from February and down 2% on a year earlier. Adzuna\u2019s jobs market report, which is based on all online job adverts in the UK, found that in all regions, except Northern Ireland, advertised salaries fell year-on-year in March. \u201cIt\u2019s a time of turbulence for the jobs market. Unemployment is climbing and political uncertainty could well be impacting hiring plans,\u201d said Adzuna\u2019s co-founder, Doug Monro. \u201cIn particular, recent reports indicate hiring permanent staff may be being put on pause until after the EU referendum as employers turn to temporary workers to fill gaps.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Leaving the EU could put \u00a3250bn of British trade at risk, former chancellor of the exchequer Alistair Darling has claimed, saying negotiating new free-trade deals with key export markets could take an average of six years. Britain exports \u00a3637bn worth of goods and services to other EU member states and more than 50 countries with which the EU has free trade agreements (FTAs), according to analysis for Britain Stronger in Europe, the official campaign to keep Britain in the EU at the 23 June referendum. Switching to less preferential World Trade Organisation rules \u2013 the stopgap arrangement Brexit campaigners suggest would be in place while talks on new trade deals get under way \u2013 could jeopardise more than a third of that trade, or \u00a3250bn, as tariffs on British exports increased, the campaign claimed. \u201cThose wanting to leave the EU want to pull Britain out of the single market, which would mean introducing tariffs and barriers to our trade and putting billions of vital trade at risk,\u201d Darling said. \u201cThere is no trading arrangement outside the EU that gives us the free trade we rely on today. Leaving would put jobs, low prices and financial security at risk.\u201d Looking at all the FTAs negotiated by the EU since 1974, the average time taken to reach a deal was six years, the campaign found, underlining the challenge facing Britain if it sought to put in place new deals after leaving the EU. The deal with Albania \u2013 which has been cited by some in Vote Leave as an indication of the kind of relationship Britain might hope to achieve \u2013 took six years to negotiate; Israel\u2019s took eight years and Macedonia\u2019s almost five. The former chancellor is the latest in a series of politicians and economists, including Barack Obama, lined up by the remain campaign to encourage voters to reject the risks of ditching EU membership. However, Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott accused the remain campaign of underestimating the UK\u2019s ability to make its way in the world. \u201cBritain Stronger in Europe can\u2019t even be consistent or honest in their campaign to do down the British economy. Their underlying belief appears to be that Britain \u2013 the world\u2019s fifth largest economy and a nation with a great history of trading across the globe \u2013 would be an economic backwater if it wasn\u2019t for Brussels taking control of our trade deals. That\u2019s absurd.\u201d While the remain camp continues to focus primarily on the economic risks of Brexit, former EU commissioner Peter Mandelson accused leave campaigners of playing on fears about immigration, as they struggled to win over swing voters. Writing in the Guardian, Mandelson accused the justice secretary, Michael Gove, the chair of the Leave campaign, of \u201cputting truth to one side\u201d for an article he wrote in Saturday\u2019s Daily Mail warning of the risks of uncontrolled immigration, and the likelihood that Turkey will join the EU. Mandelson said Vote Leave began the campaign determined to stick to the safer ground of the economy and leave migration to Nigel Farage, whose Ukip party has its own Leave campaign, Grassroots Out. But he claimed that as Vote Leave has struggled to win the argument, and the remain camp has edged ahead in the polls, they have decided to switch their tactics. \u201cFrom Johnson questioning President Obama\u2019s \u2018part-Kenyan ancestry\u2019 to EU immigrants being blamed for the problems in everything from British schools to our health service to our prisons, every recent Vote Leave intervention has had immigration at its heart,\u201d Mandelson said.",

      "bodyText": "Though the early skirmishes of a campaign will not determine the result, the battle lines of the EU referendum contest are being firmly established. Those campaigning to get Britain out of the EU are gradually being forced to abandon a strategy based on economic argument in favour of Nigel Farage\u2019s long preferred dog-whistle tactics. This is now developing into a contest between the economy and immigration. But for a while, it did not look like the campaign would be fought along such predictable lines. Unlike Farage\u2019s provisional wing, the official wing of the leave campaign initially shied away from pandering to xenophobia and using anti-immigration rhetoric to galvanise support. After all, Boris Johnson used to talk of the \u201cmassive\u201d benefits of immigration and once backed an amnesty for illegal immigrants, and has repeatedly called for Turkey to join the EU, something that is not going to happen any time soon. Johnson is not alone. According to colleagues, Michael Gove used to take a decidedly emollient position on immigration in cabinet discussions against Theresa May\u2019s harder line. Dominic Cummings, the campaign director, used to say that their side \u201cdoes not need to focus on immigration\u201d. Gisela Stuart, Labour\u2019s lonely Vote Leave chair, has previously described migration as a \u201cforce for good\u201d and believes Ukip feeds \u201cdiscontent, despair and division\u201d in its attitudes towards foreigners. Stuart must have winced then, when she opened Saturday\u2019s Daily Mail to see Gove\u2019s sinister piece on EU expansion that had the justice secretary\u2019s name on it but could have been penned by Farage himself. In a disturbing echo of Ukip\u2019s last party political broadcast, which told numerous untruths about Turkey, Gove asserted that 77 million Turkish Muslim citizens would soon be using the NHS, and Albanian criminals were about to flood Britain. From Johnson questioning President Obama\u2019s \u201cpart-Kenyan ancestry\u201d to EU migrants being blamed for the problems in everything from British schools to our health service to our prisons, every recent Vote Leave intervention has had immigration at its heart. Should we be disappointed by this change in tone? Yes. Should we be worried? No. As Vote Leave spokesman Robert Oxley once perceptively said: \u201cThe one thing you know is that people care more about their jobs than they do about migration.\u201d Swallowing the nasty Ukip strategy wholesale may energise the rightwing base of the leave campaign but I cannot see it being enough to persuade more than half of the voting public to take a leap in the dark in quitting the EU. People want to know what will happen to their jobs, their pay packets and their weekly shopping bill more than they want to hear abusive rhetoric and nationalistic myths. Why the change in strategy then? Because what little economic credibility leave campaigners had was shredded by George Osborne and Obama in the space of a week. First the Treasury showed that quitting the EU\u2019s single market would take 6% out of our GDP and leave a \u00a336bn black hole in our public finances. Leave campaigners had no answer to the Treasury\u2019s finding that Brexit would cost every household an average of \u00a34,300 a year. Obama then stepped in to make it clear that, once out of the EU, the rest of the world did not offer salvation. Even America, he said, Britain\u2019s special friend, would put us at the back of the queue in future trade priorities. The leave campaigners knew they could not afford to cede the economy entirely and so rustled up a motley crew of economists to fly in the face of all credible international and domestic economic analysis and suggest we would actually be better off outside the EU. In doing so, they embraced the Treasury\u2019s worst-case scenario of moving to trade based on simple World Trade Organisation rules, which would increase the per-household loss from Brexit to an eye-watering \u00a35,200 a year. Leave\u2019s economic case is dissolving. It has forced Johnson, Stuart and Gove to pretend they were secret Kippers all along. By throwing in the towel on economics and putting the end of free movement before Britain\u2019s future prosperity, they are endorsing Ukip\u2019s sugar-daddy, Arron Banks, in accepting that the huge economic cost of doing so is \u201ca price worth paying\u201d. When tested with the public, almost no undecided or wavering voters agree. Does this mean the remain campaign is home and dry? Absolutely not. It must not tire in spelling out Britain\u2019s trade gains and job benefits from being in Europe\u2019s single market. People in Britain \u2013 and elsewhere in Europe, for that matter \u2013 are rightly concerned about current levels of migration and the impact these have on our way of life and on public services. That\u2019s why the arrangements negotiated by David Cameron to make welfare entitlements for EU nationals more conditional in Britain are being viewed enviously by other member state governments. But it is not the only thing the public worry about. I believe that British people want an immigration system that is fair and managed. They don\u2019t want anyone taking us for a ride, but people who come here to work hard, pay their taxes and support our public services (like the 120,000 EU nationals working in our health and social care system) should be welcomed. I also believe the public value even more highly an economy that is growing, creating jobs and keeping prices low. On the remain side, we must strain every sinew to persuade people that inside the EU they can have both economic prosperity and managed migration. Whereas, outside, we would be swapping economic security for Farage and Vote Leave\u2019s vision of Britain: closed, inward-looking, intolerant and anti-foreigner. That\u2019s the difference between patriotism \u2013 love of your own country \u2013 and nationalism: hatred of other people\u2019s countries. Over the course of the campaign, I hope that the British public will see through the narrow, divisive arguments peddled by the leave campaign. Polling evidence suggests that, if we get our arguments across effectively, economics will trump immigration as the deciding consideration for most voters. That\u2019s why the remain campaign, at this stage in the race, is in a better place than those who would have us leave.",

    "webTitle": "Sir David Attenborough warns against playing 'fast and loose' with BBC", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir David Attenborough has warned the government not to play \u201cfast and loose\u201d with the BBC, which he described as \u201cone of the most precious things we have\u201d. The acclaimed natural history broadcaster said last year\u2019s funding deal in which the BBC took on the \u00a3700m-plus cost of free licence fees for the over-75s was \u201cterrible\u201d. Attenborough spoke out ahead of his 90th birthday on Sunday 8 May \u2013 to be marked by a special season of programmes across the BBC \u2013 and days before the government is expected to publish its white paper on the future of the corporation. Over the weekend, the government was forced to deny reports that it was seeking to influence BBC scheduling so that popular shows such as Strictly Come Dancing would not be screened at the same time as big programmes on rival channels. The shadow culture secretary, Maria Eagle, said: \u201cJohn Whittingdale [the culture secretary] is behaving as if he were running the BBC \u2013 he is not. This kind of meddling in day-to-day scheduling decisions would be a completely unacceptable interference in the independence of the BBC.\u201d Attenborough told the Guardian: \u201cThere is plenty that viewers can do. Politicians don\u2019t wish to be the people who are branded as getting rid of the BBC. They know that the BBC holds a very precious place in a large proportion of voters\u2019 minds and they can\u2019t play fast and loose with it as they would wish. \u201cWhen I saw what the [funding] deal was I thought, that\u2019s terrible, that\u2019s a distortion. What the BBC will say, and I daresay they are right, is the alternative was something worse.\u201d He added: \u201cThe basic principle of public service broadcasting is profoundly important. If we lose that we really lose a very valuable thing, you are throwing away one of the most precious things that we have.\u201d The BBC negotiated a number of conditions in last year\u2019s pre-budget deal, including an inflation-linked rise in the licence fee, but doubts remain over its future funding, with its size and scale far from certain. Attenborough has previously warned that the BBC was in \u201creal danger\u201d from cuts and online rivals such as Netflix. \u201cOf course the BBC has got to change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole [of broadcasting] has changed beyond recognition. When I joined the BBC it was like a civil service, a monopoly, and there\u2019s no comparison to what it is now.\u201d Reports of his impending retirement have once again proved premature, with Attenborough recently returned from a ballooning trip 11,000 feet above the Alps to film for a sequel to his landmark 2006 series Planet Earth. He said the new series would be \u201clargely technologically led in that we can do things that we couldn\u2019t before, in terms of the size and sensitivity of cameras, drones, all that sort of stuff. \u201cYou go for what is new, what more have we discovered, and what exciting species are there that we haven\u2019t seen before. It\u2019s a good series, I think.\u201d It will also reflect the issue of climate change, he added. In a recent Guardian interview Attenborough said he didn\u2019t have a \u201crosy view of life, of the future\u201d. \u201cNo I don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, in fact the world, things aren\u2019t getting better particularly, are they? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you give up hope or that there aren\u2019t all kinds of personal salvations that might come your way, but the planet as a whole is getting overrun by us and for the natural world it\u2019s not doing as well as it might have done.\u201d Attenborough is a prominent supporter of an Apollo-style research programme to harness energy from the sun and make renewable energy cheaper than fossil fuels. \u201cIf we could put a man on the moon in 10 years you mean to say we can\u2019t solve the problem of getting one 500th part of the energy from the sun? It\u2019s really a tiny technological problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re proposing a route map in which you look at where the congestions are, as it were, and getting international organisations to look and say, \u2018I\u2019ll tackle this, you tackle that\u2019, and within 10 years we\u2019ll be able to produce the whole thing and bingo.\u201d The BBC\u2019s Attenborough season includes a special 60-minute programme, Attenborough at 90, on his birthday, four documentaries spanning his career and one of his first programmes, Zoo Quest, shown in colour for the first time. Zoo Quest features extraordinary footage including Attenborough chasing an anteater and wrestling, shirtless, with a baby crocodile. \u201cThey said do your best, dear boy, and we\u2019ll see you at Christmas,\u201d Attenborough remembered of the series which began in 1954; the first six shows made for a budget of \u00a31,000. More than 60 years later he is still making programmes, with his latest, Life that Glows, about the magical light made by glow worms, fire flies and luminous plankton, to be broadcast on BBC2 on 9 May. On the prospect of turning 90, Attenborough said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe it, really. The only conclusion you can have is that by God, you are lucky. \u201cWhen you think, I have relatives and friends who are 90 and they can\u2019t remember what day it is and they can\u2019t walk \u2013 this is not Christian virtue, just luck.\u201d Attenborough at 90 is on BBC1 at 7pm on 8 May",

This kind of meddling in day-to-day scheduling decisions would be a completely unacceptable interference in the independence of the BBC.\u201d</p> <p>Attenborough told the Guardian: \u201cThere is plenty that viewers can do. Politicians don\u2019t wish to be the people who are branded as getting rid of the BBC. They know that the BBC holds a very precious place in a large proportion of voters\u2019 minds and they can\u2019t play fast and loose with it as they would wish.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I saw what the [funding] deal was I thought, that\u2019s terrible, that\u2019s a distortion. What the BBC will say, and I daresay they are right, is the alternative was something worse.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe basic principle of public service broadcasting is profoundly important. If we lose that we really lose a very valuable thing, you are throwing away one of the most precious things that we have.\u201d</p> <p>The BBC negotiated a number of conditions in last year\u2019s pre-budget deal, including an inflation-linked rise in the licence fee, but doubts remain over its future funding, with its size and scale far from certain.</p> <p>Attenborough has previously warned that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/05/david-attenborough-says-bbc-in-real-danger-in-face-of-cuts-and-online-rivals\">BBC was in \u201creal danger\u201d</a> from cuts and online rivals such as Netflix. </p> <p>\u201cOf course the BBC has got to change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole [of broadcasting] has changed beyond recognition. When I joined the BBC it was like a civil service, a monopoly, and there\u2019s no comparison to what it is now.\u201d</p> <p>Reports of his impending retirement have once again proved premature, with Attenborough recently returned from a ballooning trip 11,000 feet above the Alps to film for a sequel to his landmark 2006 series Planet Earth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCEarth/status/720321458421911552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">David Attenborough at 11,000 feet over the Alps in a hot air balloon <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlanetEarthII?src=hash\">#PlanetEarthII</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeGunton\">@MikeGunton</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EarthOnLocation?src=hash\">#EarthOnLocation</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/JtUm20FOLG\">pic.twitter.com/JtUm20FOLG</a></p>&mdash; BBC Earth (@BBCEarth) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCEarth/status/720321458421911552\">April 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>He said the new series would be \u201clargely technologically led in that we can do things that we couldn\u2019t before, in terms of the size and sensitivity of cameras, drones, all that sort of stuff.</p> <p>\u201cYou go for what is new, what more have we discovered, and what exciting species are there that we haven\u2019t seen before.

      "bodyText": "Pop band Years &amp; Years, street artist Banksy and the TV adaptation of Wolf Hall have been announced as nominations for the 2016 South Bank Sky Arts awards, which are celebrating their 20th anniversary this year. The awards are unique in focusing on the arts in their entirety and are due to take place in London on 5 June. Other nominations include an embroidery of the Magna Carta by artist Cornelia Parker, Northern Ballet\u2019s 1984 and the Almeida theatre\u2019s politically charged contemporary production of Aeschylus\u2019s Oresteia. There are 10 categories, including dance, opera, comedy, TV drama, literature, classical music, pop, film, visual art and theatre, along with the Times breakthrough award, which recognises up-and-coming talent and an outstanding achievement award. The South Bank Sky Arts awards originated in 1996 in association with the South Bank Show, and Melvyn Bragg has served as editor and host since their inception. In a statement, Bragg said the awards are a snapshot of a unique moment in British cultural history. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s when 30 nominees in 10 categories meet to celebrate the best work being done by artists in this country across a wide range of ages and backgrounds. There are world-class performances, the awards of scholarships to new artists on top of the awards to the winners, judged by an independent panel, all resulting in a 90-minute programme that gives us a rich picture of where we are now in an area of achievement in which at the moment Britain can claim to be in a dominating position.\u201d Phil Edgar-Jones, director of Sky Arts, said the awards \u201cbring together probably the most inspiring room full of creative people it\u2019s possible to assemble\u201d. Twenty years ago, in the inaugural awards, classic sitcom Father Ted won the comedy award, while performances from David Suchet and Diana Rigg in Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? secured a win in the theatre category and Matthew Bourne\u2019s retelling of Swan Lake won in the dance category. Through the years, other winners have included Seamus Heaney, Amy Winehouse, Alan Bennett, Gilbert and George, Grayson Perry, FKA Twigs, Rachel Whiteread, Antony Gormley, Florence + the Machine, Kate Bush, Ted Hughes and Hilary Mantel. Winners of multiple South Bank Sky Arts awards in their individual categories include artist Anish Kapoor, director Shane Meadows, band Arctic Monkeys, director Sam Mendes, author Ian McEwan and playwright Michael Frayn. Frayn also went on to win the outstanding achievement award in 2012. Other outstanding achievement award winners over the years include Peter Hall, Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, Helen Mirren, Richard Attenborough, JK Rowling, the Who, Judi Dench, Julie Walters, Tracey Emin and last year\u2019s winner, Sylvie Guillem. The awards will be shown on Sky Arts on 8 June. A full list of this year\u2019s nominations is below.

      "bodyText": "Claudio Ranieri made an emotional phone call to Guus Hiddink to thank Chelsea for handing Leicester City the title after a tumultuous night when the Italian\u2019s name was sung loud at Stamford Bridge. Ranieri, who managed Chelsea before Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was first appointed manager in 2004, telephoned Hiddink after flying back from Italy where he had been lunching with his 96-year-old mother. Tempers flared at the final whistle as Tottenham and Chelsea players and staff became embroiled in a mass brawl by the tunnel but after Eden Hazard\u2019s equaliser Ranieri\u2019s name was sung by the delighted Chelsea fans who were desperate to end Spurs\u2019 title hopes. Hiddink said: \u201cJust after the final whistle, a few minutes after the judo, I got a call from Ranieri. He thanked us especially for what we did in the second half and I congratulated him for being champions. They deserved it, it may be a bit of a shock for the established clubs that they did so well. They didn\u2019t implode, there was no tension when they started smelling the title. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any tears because it was not a Facetime conversation but his voice was trembling a bit. He said five times thanks. His emotion was going up.\u201d Hiddink, who will be replaced by Antonio Conte in the summer, did not start Eden Hazard despite the Belgian\u2019s two goals at Bournemouth last week but Hazard came on at half-time and made the decisive impact late on with a curled equaliser to send the title to the east Midlands. Hazard and Cesc F\u00e0bregas had spoken after the Bournemouth victory of their desire to end Tottenham\u2019s title ambitions here and Hiddink praised the Belgian\u2019s impact. \u201cEden has had a difficult season, a lot of injuries coming back, a lot of setbacks, he had a lot of frustrations,\u201d said the Dutch coach. \u201cHe played 90 minutes in Bournemouth in a less intense game. My plan was then for him to be of use in this game. It was more wise to bring him later on in the game and have him at full speed. He did very well, you saw there what he is capable of.\u201d It is a first Premier League title for both Ranieri and Leicester City, who were 5,000-1 shots to win the division at the beginning of the season. Despite the tempestuous nature of this finale in west London, both Hiddink and the Tottenham manager, Mauricio Pochettino, said Leicester were deserved title winners. Pochettino said: \u201cFirst of all I want to congratulate Leicester, Ranieri, the players and the staff and of course the supporters. They had a great season, they deserve the title. I\u2019m disappointed because we fought to be in the race. We\u2019re disappointed but at the same time I\u2019m proud of my players, the season was fantastic and we will still fight for second place. \u201cI want to congratulate Claudio and the Leicester players, it was a massive, amazing season for them. They deserve it, this is sure. We need to be stronger next season and try to be in the race for the title.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Mark Selby, whose only success this season had been to win the minor Gdynia Open event in Poland, won a second trophy here evening \u2013 the Betfred World Championship 2016. In beating Ding Junhui 18-14 \u2013 a repeat of his score against Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan in the final two years ago \u2013 he became only the sixth multiple world champion in Crucible history, joining Stephen Hendry (7), Steve Davis (6), O\u2019Sullivan (5), John Higgins (4) and Mark Williams (2). And of the players mentioned he most closely resembles Higgins, for the excellence of his match play and all-round skills, and the ability to win crucial matches with his B game. Selby, a Leicester City supporter who won his title only a few minutes after his football team had been confirmed as champions, has been on his B game throughout this championship and he was able to lift himself only occasionally in his largely tactical, safety-based victory. But it was still good enough to beat Ding, who ultimately had to be content with becoming the first Asian player to reach the final. Selby went into the second day of the final leading 10-7. Ding was the perkier, more confident player at the start and won the first two frames. But the opening session was shared 4-4. When Selby won the first two frames of the final session to go 16-11 up it looked all over. But then Ding won three in a row, the last with a break of 103, to make it 16-14. But that was to be Ding\u2019s last success. Selby won the scrappy next frame before taking the title with a break of 74. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic. It was very special to win it two years ago but I felt under a lot more pressure now than I did then. I don\u2019t know which is the bigger shock, me winning this or Leicester City winning the Premier League. I\u2019m so proud of Claudio and the boys. We\u2019re only a small place. \u201cIt was a tough final and with the amount of pressure Ding is under, from China alone, but to play like that \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine how he could do that. \u201cIn the first to 18 a 6-0 lead is not a huge one, especially against someone like Ding. He played fantastically earlier today and I had to just hang on to him. I\u2019m just over the moon. I saved my best performance for the final and I only had two good sessions in the tournament. Luckily my \u2018B\u2019 game is pretty good.\u201d Rob Walker, snooker\u2019s wonderfully energetic and comic MC, who appears to have walked straight off the pages of the Pickwick Papers, has nicknames for all the players. Some work well, others less so. But when Walker introduces Selby as \u201cThe Jester from Leicester\u201d it is as if his humour has taken a decidedly ironic turn. Steve Davis was closer to the mark when, referring to Selby\u2019s Sunday evening vigil, he described him as \u201cthe night porter from hell\u201d. Selby is also, according to his old mentor Willie Thorne, \u201cthe most dedicated snooker player I have ever seen\u201d. There is a rare determination about him, which is hardy surprising in view of the fact his mother walked out of the family home when he was only eight. He and his brother were brought up unaided by their father, who died when Mark was 16. The influence of Ding\u2019s father was hardly any less relevant. When he was eight years old he took \u201cLittle Ding\u201d with him to a local snooker hall and, when his father went to the toilet, he returned to find his baby-faced son had taken over his cue and won the match for him. While another memorable final was being played out, the World Snooker chairman, Barry Hearn, celebrated a \u201cboom time for the sport\u201d, announcing a two-year extension to the sport\u2019s contract with the BBC, which will run until 2019, while announcing the world championship will remain in Sheffield until 2027. Hearn said: \u201cThe BBC have gone the extra mile for us. They have had their licence fee frozen by HM Government. It\u2019s cut their arms off, in terms of competing with the pay broadcasters, but compete they did. \u201cThe BBC are struggling financially. But they have really got behind snooker. We have had 20 extra hours of additional coverage this year. That\u2019s good because it shows that once they have bought something they really make the most of it, instead of hiding it in the schedules. Now I can\u2019t wait to see the numbers coming in from China.\u201d It was another memorable final \u2013 particularly when the form of these players this season is considered. Ding, ranked 17, had to qualify for this championship.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Politicians who run for president are used to scorn, mockery and a healthy skepticism from the American people. But few have been heckled by a 12-year-old, questioned about their Canadian birth, or had their spouse field questions about their resemblance to a serial killer. All in one day. Ted Cruz suffered all this and more on Monday in Indiana, a state where he desperately needs to do well if he wants to preserve any hope of winning the Republican nomination for president. Simple arithmetic eliminated Cruz from an outright victory two weeks ago, but he has clung to the possibility that he could deny Donald Trump the 1,237 delegates a candidate needs to win the primary election. Indiana and California are the two largest states that could tilt the race in favor of a contested convention, in which Cruz would have a chance of beating Trump. But Cruz, called \u201cLucifer in the flesh\u201d by one of his former colleagues in Congress last week, found little more love in Indiana than in Washington. The trouble started with a 12-year-old in La Porte, Indiana. At a rally there, a boy shouted \u201cYou suck!\u201d and \u201cShut up!\u201d during Cruz\u2019s stump speech, thwarting the senator\u2019s attempts to turn the pubescent heckler into a talking point. \u201cYou know, one of the things that hopefully someone has told you is that children should speak with respect,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cImagine what a different world it would be if someone had told Donald Trump that, years ago.\u201d Eventually he gave up, saying: \u201cIn my household, when a child behaves that way they get a spanking.\u201d Police escorted the boy away, shouts of \u201cshut up\u201d continuing. Later, Cruz was confronted near his campaign bus by supporters of his rival, who gleefully shouted \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted!\u201d at the senator from a few feet away, using Trump\u2019s preferred nickname for Cruz. Trump has bestowed pet names on each of his rivals \u2013 \u201cLittle Marco\u201d Rubio, \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d Clinton and \u201cComrade\u201d Bernie Sanders, for instance \u2013 and has reminded his fans repeatedly that Ted Cruz was recently a dual Canadian American citizen. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out tomorrow,\u201d the Trump supporter said. \u201cIndiana don\u2019t want you.\u201d The Princeton alumnus and champion debater tried to engage. \u201cThe question everyone here should ask ... \u201d \u201cAre you Canadian?\u201d the voter asked, to titters from the crowd. Then: \u201cWhere\u2019s your Goldman Sachs jacket?\u201d an allusion to the employer of Cruz\u2019s wife. Always a lawyer \u2013 and one who has argued successfully before the supreme court \u2013 Cruz tried a different tack: an appeal to civility. \u201cIf I were Donald Trump, I wouldn\u2019t have come over to talk to you,\u201d he said. \u201cSir, America is a better country ... \u201d \u201cWithout you!\u201d \u201cThank you for those kind sentiments,\u201d he said. \u201cI respect your right to speak but I\u2019m also going to say in America we are a nation that is better than anger and insults and cursing and rage. And I believe the people in Indiana have common sense and good judgement and want real solu \u2013 \u201d \u201cWoo! Vote Trump! Woo!\u201d the voter screamed, followed by others in the crowd. Cruz spun on his heels and walked away. Cruz\u2019s allies did not have much a better day. His wife, Heidi, was asked by Yahoo News to comment on a string of jokes at this weekend\u2019s White House correspondents dinner, made at her husband\u2019s expense. On Saturday, the comedian Larry Wilmore invoked an internet meme that pretends the senator is the Zodiac Killer, the enigmatic and never-captured murderer who puzzled authorities with coded notes and claimed to have killed several people in the late 1960s and early 70s. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been married to him for 15 years and I know pretty well who he is, so it doesn\u2019t bother me at all. There\u2019s a lot of garbage out there,\u201d Heidi Cruz said. Elsewhere, Cruz\u2019s would-be running mate, Carly Fiorina, slipped off a stage at a rally as Cruz obliviously continued to shake supporters\u2019 hands. Trump later commented: \u201cCruz didn\u2019t do anything; even I would have helped her ... That was a weird deal.\u201d There was no report of any injury, but internet comedians quickly seized on her literal pratfall, as well as a strange, fumbling hand clasp she attempted with Cruz. Nor could the Cruz campaign find any comfort in the polls. Averages show Cruz tanking: down 14 points to Trump, while John Kasich hovers around 11%, without enough support to make up for Cruz\u2019s deficit even if all of Kasich\u2019s voters suddenly defected to the Texan. Trump needs about 45% of the remaining delegates in order to reach 1,237, CBS estimates \u2013 a viable possibility, considering his good chances in California, the state with the most delegates. But Cruz insisted that even without Indiana, he \u201cabsolutely\u201d had a path to the nomination, defying the cries of Trump supporters to \u201cdo the math\u201d. Nor do Americans in general seem to be taking a liking to Cruz, even though a recent Washington Post-ABC poll shows that 67% of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of Trump. Fifty-three per cent of Americans dislike Cruz. A March poll found that 52% of Americans have unfavorable opinions of Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee.

      "bodyText": "The self-immolation of a second asylum seeker on Nauru and the expected closure of the Manus Island detention centre could force the major parties to rethink their ban on letting those refugees settle in Australia, political journalist George Megalogenis has said. Speaking on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program on Monday night, Megalogenis said Papua New Guinea\u2019s decision to close Manus Island detention centre after its supreme court ruled it illegal, coupled with recent tragedies on Nauru, had made the issue difficult to ignore. \u201cManus Island is clearly not functional at the moment but the government thinks: \u2018If we bring them onshore we\u2019ve lost a debate and we\u2019ll lose the election\u2019,\u201d Megalogenis said. \u201cMalcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten would rather talk about anything else. They don\u2019t want to see boats coming in the middle of an election campaign.\u201d But Megalogenis said reports of the growing mental health crisis in Australia\u2019s offshore detention centres could force either the Coalition or Labor to act. A 21-year-old Somalian woman set herself alight in Nauru detention centre on Monday, three days after an Iranian refugee, a 23-year-old man named Omid, died from burns sustained when he set himself alight on Nauru on Wednesday. The woman, named Hodan, was taken to Nauru hospital with severe burns on Monday night. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how many boats come or don\u2019t, if one person a week is setting themselves alight in an election campaign, sooner or later is going to target our consciousness that we\u2019re holding hostage hundreds of people because we can\u2019t sort this out,\u201d he said. \u201cI think in the long run the world, when it pays attention to Australia, wants to see a good citizen \u2026 and when we start playing other games, trying to be the nastiest country in the region \u2013 out Trump-ing Trump before Trump had even been invented in terms of asylum seeker policy \u2013 I think it\u2019s only a matter of time before our luck runs out.\u201d Megalogenis made the comment in response to a question from Lauren Malanos, who asked why Malcolm Turnbull had refused New Zealand\u2019s offer to take the Manus Island detainees. \u201cPeople do not seek asylum because a people smuggler convinced them through effective marketing \u2026 When can we stop purposefully denying existing refugees their futures simply to use them as a deterrent and help them, as is every developed country\u2019s duty?\u201d Malanos said. The panel included Megalogenis; Australian Financial Review political editor Laura Tingle; American writer and journalist James Fallows; the NSW assistant minister for health, Pru Goward; and Iain Walker, the executive director of the newDemocracy Foundation. Fallows, a national correspondent with the Atlantic, said Australia\u2019s approach to asylum seekers had damaged its international reputation. \u201cAustralia does not look good at the moment with this policy, on either side of the debate, but no-one looks good [on the refugee issue] right now,\u201d he said. Goward, asked whether she thought Australia should accept New Zealand\u2019s offer to take the Manus refugees, said it was \u201cnot an issue, I have to say, I have followed very closely\u201d and that she had \u201cno opinion\u201d. Turnbull is expected to call an election this week after the budget is handed down on Tuesday. Tingle said the resulting race would be between a man who believed himself born to be prime minister, but was not very good at politics, and a \u201cstreet fighter\u201d in Bill Shorten. \u201cThis campaign will either see him [Turnbull] turn into a PM who can lead, who can communicate, because it will just snap into place, or he\u2019s going to spontaneously combust like the drummer from Spinal Tap,\u201d she said. Tingle said that coming up against a one-term government meant the Labor party had \u201cabsolutely nothing to lose\u201d and was prepared to take risks, which differentiated this election from the past six years of conservative politics. But Walker, whose organisation runs \u201ccitizen juries\u201d to provide policy alternatives to local and state governments, said the Australian political system was not designed for deep election-time policy discussions. \u201cWe have built a system that responds really well to slogans ... We\u2019ve built a system based on voting for the person you hate less,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "When Leicester City won 4-2 at home to Sunderland on the opening day, to be top of the nascent Premier League table, few paid any attention. Though they remained there or thereabouts for a few weeks, a 5-2 home defeat to Arsenal on 26 September was seen as the shape of things to come. That, though, was their last league defeat until falling at Liverpool on Boxing Day, by which time Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side were back on top. They lost again to Arsenal \u2013 on Valentine\u2019s Day \u2013 but once again no slump followed: seven wins in their next nine games, while others fell by the wayside, moved them to the verge of glory. They secured a precious point at Old Trafford on Sunday and could celebrate the title after Tottenham drew at Chelsea the following day. 2003-04: Arsenal\u2019s Invincibles go all the way Ars\u00e8ne Wenger boldly predicted his Arsenal team could go through an entire league campaign without defeat, and his prophecy did not take long to come true. Arsenal made a statement with nine wins in a row at the turn of the year to open up a gap at the top of the table but still had to wait until 25 April to secure the title. Perhaps the best thing about this win? They achieved it playing a scintillating, high-tempo brand of attacking football that few have come close to replicating since. 1999-00: Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a shocks Spain The turn of the Millennium brought about one of the biggest shocks in Spanish football history as Deportivo upset the applecart and won La Liga for the first time.

      "bodyText": "When Claudio Ranieri was appointed as manager last summer I was buzzing. With my family being Italian, I was thinking: \u201cThis was going to be incredible.\u201d My prediction was that we could finish in the top 10 and we could win a cup. But everybody thought I was insane. I started getting texts from my pals \u2013 which I\u2019ve saved \u2013 saying: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What are they thinking?\u201d The stars have aligned because for the past 12 years Kasabian has missed huge chunks of the season by being away on tour \u2013 watching games in Tokyo hotel rooms. But this season Tom Meighan, our singer, and I have managed to see most of it. We\u2019ve been to home games and, with friends having magic boxes that stream away games, I\u2019ve seen every kick. There have been so many great moments. Jamie Vardy making history with the goal against United was such a special moment. When he did it there was the kind of cheer you hardly ever hear \u2013 everyone knew it was special. And beating Manchester City away 3-1 and the manner in which we did it \u2013 that was when you felt the bubble wasn\u2019t going to burst. I first started thinking we could qualify for the Champions League when we were still top at Christmas, then carried on picking up points in January. I thought that if we kept everyone fit until the end of the season, I didn\u2019t see why we couldn\u2019t finish in the top four. But you always worry something mad will happen \u2013 what if we lost Riyad Mahrez for weeks? \u2013 because I didn\u2019t think we had the depth in the squad if it did. The emotions at the games in the last few weeks have been incredible. Those 1-0 wins against Watford, Palace. You grind away and then you get that one chance on the break. The last 10 minutes of these games have been horrendous \u2013 it reminded me of our experiences at Wembley in the playoffs and that horrible feeling when your whole season rests on those 90 minutes. The games have been hard to watch because they have meant so much, although watching Spurs against West Brom was the worst I\u2019ve felt \u2013 probably worse than watching Leicester. We need to mention Andy King, who\u2019s been with Leicester 10 years through the hard times in the lower divisions. He\u2019s a wonderful player and when he does come in and play he\u2019s slotted in and dug it out. That link he has to the past creates a bond with the fans. And it mattered that we didn\u2019t spend a lot of money on players, even in the January transfer window \u2013 we were right in the mix and we could have had the owners demanding a marquee signing. But we didn\u2019t do that. We didn\u2019t sign anyone. That was a real turning point because the players who were there felt they had been trusted. I could feel the players respond. I hope they continue that way. I think they\u2019re clever enough to realise what they\u2019ve built, because we\u2019ve all seen other sides make that mistake of going out and spending too much. But winning the Premier League? After that, even if we get relegated and we\u2019re in the conference in 10 years, I won\u2019t care. We\u2019ll always have that. As for next season: we all live in Leicester so all my pals are coming in and we\u2019re having a Champions League draw party \u2013 it\u2019s already on the calendar. As soon as we find out who we\u2019re playing it\u2019s straight online to book tickets and flights. I fancy Bar\u00e7a or Real and it would be nice for Ranieri to go back to Roma. Everyone loves us this year but I know as soon as next season starts, all the other fans will be singing: \u201cWhere were you when you were shit?\u201d And we\u2019ve got the perfect answer: \u201cBeating you when you were shit.\u201d Serge Pizzorno is guitarist and songwriter for Kasabian",

But Adel al-Jubeir did warn that the proposed law, which could hold the kingdom responsible for any role in the terrorist atrocity, would erode global investor confidence in the US. A bipartisan Senate bill would remove immunity from foreign governments and allow victims of the attacks in New York and Washington to sue the Saudi government if it is found to have been involved. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers that day were Saudi citizens but the government has long denied any role. Last month, the New York Times reported that Saudi Arabia had threatened to sell up to $750bn worth of American assets should the bill become law. But speaking to reporters in Geneva on Monday after talks with the US secretary of state, John Kerry, Jubeir was quoted as saying: \u201cWe say a law like this would cause an erosion of investor confidence. But then to kind of say, \u2018My God, the Saudis are threatening us\u2019 \u2013 ridiculous. \u201cWe don\u2019t use monetary policy and we don\u2019t use energy policy and we don\u2019t use economic policy for political purposes. When we invest, we invest as investors. When we sell oil, we sell oil as traders,\u201d he said, as Reuters reported. Pressed on whether Saudi Arabia had suggested that the law could affect its investment policies, the foreign minister said: \u201cI say you can warn. What has happened is that people are saying we threatened. We said that a law like this is going to cause investor confidence to shrink. And so not just for Saudi Arabia, but for everybody.\u201d Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and her Democratic election rival, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, have both said they back the measure, but Barack Obama has publicly opposed it. The White House has reportedly lobbied Congress to block passage of the bill, which passed the Senate judiciary committee earlier this year. Jubeir was quoted as adding: \u201cIn fact, what they are doing is stripping the principle of sovereign immunities, which would turn the world for international law into the law of the jungle. \u201cThat\u2019s why the administration is opposed to it, and that\u2019s why every country in the world is opposed to it. And then people say: \u2018Saudi Arabia is threatening the US by pulling our investments.\u2019 Nonsense.\u201d Another potential rift in the relationship is a continuing effort to declassify a 28-page section of a 2004 US government report on the 9/11 attacks that is believed to detail possible Saudi connections. But on Sunday, John Brennan, the director of the CIA, defended the decision to keep this section under wraps. \u201cIt was a preliminary review that put information in there that was not corroborated, not vetted and not deemed to be accurate,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cThis chapter was kept out because of concerns about sensitive source of methods, investigative actions.\u201d He warned: \u201cI think some people may seize upon that uncorroborated, unvetted information that was in there that was basically just a collation of this information that came out of FBI files, and to point to Saudi involvement, which I think would be very, very inaccurate.\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said on Monday that Obama had been briefed on the contents of the pages but not read them. \u201cThe president obviously reads a lot of material on a day to day basis,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that he felt that it was necessary for him to read those 28 pages.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Fairy tales really do come true after all it seems. Less than 10 months after starting the season as 5,000-1 outsiders, Leicester City is celebrating its first Premier League title after rivals Tottenham Hotspur failed to clinch the victory needed to keep their own hopes alive. As well as gifting Leicester with one of the greatest sporting upsets of all time, Tottenham\u2019s 2-2 draw with Chelsea set off a chain reaction ranging from a multimillion-pound hammering for bookies to the prospect of Gary Lineker now having to make good on a promise to present Match of the Day in his underwear should the club where he started his sporting career win the league. In the Midlands, fans and players got down to the serious business of celebrating at venues ranging from heaving pubs to the home of talismanic striker Jamie Vardy. For the team\u2019s players \u2013 who could have clinched the title on Sunday at Old Trafford but could only manage a 1-1 draw with Manchester United \u2013 the cauldron of Old Trafford had been swapped for hospitality at Vardy\u2019s house. In the end, the title was delivered to Leicester courtesy of an equalising goal by Chelsea\u2019s Eden Hazard, whose 83rd-minute strike squared the game with Spurs. As a wave of emotion surged from homes, pubs, community centres and other gatherings of fans in Leicester, the moment when the team\u2019s players at Vardy\u2019s house learned that they were champions was captured by defender Christian Fuchs in a video that immediately went viral. Vardy himself also didn\u2019t disappoint those expecting a reaction on social media, posting an riposte to his Tottenham counterpart, Harry Kane, whose recently tweeted image of a pack of lions had been seen as a message designed to suggest that his side were hunting Leicester down. Without words, Vardy posted an image of the moment when one of the characters from the Lion King, Mufasa, falls to his death after struggling to gain a clawhold on a cliff face as a stampede takes place below. As car horns hooted outside his window, Leicester\u2019s mayor, Peter Soulsby, told the Guardian: \u201cWe thought it couldn\u2019t get any better 12 months ago when the eyes of the world were on us as we reinterred the bones of Richard III, but this is even better. \u201cWe are very proud of what is probably the most diverse city in Europe and in fact many people see the team as a metaphor because it shows what you can really achieve when you bring a diverse group of people together.\u201d He added that the official celebrations will take place after the end of the season \u201calthough we will have two weeks of parties before then of course\u201d. Alan Sugar, a former Spurs chairman, was among the first to send his congratulations, tweeting even before the final whistle: \u201cWell done Leicester. Very well deserved and a demonstration that you don\u2019t need \u00a350m players.\u201d There were also immediate congratulations from Downing Street, where the Twitter account of David Cameron sent out the message within seconds of the game finishing: \u201cMany congratulations to Leicester. An extraordinary, thoroughly deserved, Premier League title.\u201d On the other side of the political divide, shadow chancellor John McDonnell was drawing parallels between Leicester\u2019s unlikely triumph and the elevation of another rank outsider: \u201cWho would of predicted a year ago that Leicester would win the Premier League &amp; Jeremy Corbyn would be Labour leader? Congrats to Leicester.\u201d Lineker, no doubt turning some of his thoughts quietly to the garments he would soon have to don, described the result as the biggest shock of his lifetime, later telling the BBC: \u201cIf it means that I have to wear pants during Match of the Day then I suppose I look forward to it.\u201d Having returned to Italy to fulfil a lunch date with his 96-year-old mother, Leicester\u2019s manager, Claudio Ranieri, was meanwhile reported to have flown back on a private jet in time to watch the game at his flat in the Midlands. In the run-up to kick-off, pubs in Leicester had been heaving for a second night in a row with fans decked out in the club\u2019s blue \u2013 even if some had initially appeared to be saving their pennies on a bank holiday weekend by watching the game at home before properly indulging themselves next weekend. Hazard\u2019s equaliser changed all that though, sending thousands on to the streets of the city. At least 1,000 fans arrived at the team\u2019s King Power stadium, where crowds chanted \u201cLeicester \u2019til I die\u201d and \u201cChampiones!\u201d to mark the Foxes clinching the title. Richard Hamilton, 23, said: \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing, the city has come out for this and it\u2019s just brilliant for the fans and the city as a whole.\u201d Other groups of fans celebrating in the city included Steve Robinson, 26, who told reporters: \u201cThis year I got married and had a baby, but this tops it all.\u201d",

United, who have played a game fewer than City, still have to travel to Norwich City and sixth-placed West Ham United, and face Bournemouth at home. Carrick said: \u201cWe will keep playing for the top four. We will keep going. We have got the games left. We will just look to the next game and try to win that. That\u2019s the only thing we can control and that is what we have got to focus on.\u201d \u201cWe were certainly looking to win against Leicester,\u201d Carrick said. \u201cIt was an opportunity for us to build on what we had gathered over the last few weeks, so we\u2019re disappointed with a draw. \u201cI thought we came out very well, put them under a lot of pressure and caused a lot of problems. We got a goal ahead and then their goal came out of nowhere. We are disappointed with that. It was a cheap goal to give away in the position we were in. That is hard to take but I thought we played well. The second half wasn\u2019t as good as the first 25 minutes. We\u2019re just disappointed we haven\u2019t won the game.\u201d Chris Smalling also admitted he was disappointed not to have picked up all three points against Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side but the England defender still believes there is all to play for. \u201cI thought we deserved more from the game and we all came back into the dressing room feeling disappointed. We knew how important a win would have been, so it\u2019s a big blow for us and means that we\u2019re relying on results from others more than we were before the game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what those other results bring but it\u2019s a blow for our hopes.

We have got great fans and they have shown great respect there. Fair play to them,\u201d Carrick said.",

      "bodyText": "Some insta-reaction on Twitter \u2026 Neil Robertson there, the Tom Hanks of snooker betting. Thanks for joining us on a busy old bank holiday night of sport. And over and done with well before midnight too \u2013 splendid. You\u2019ll find Paul Weaver\u2019s report from the Crucible below. That\u2019s all from me though. Bye! There\u2019s moisture welling in Ding\u2019s eyes as he gives dignified testimony to Hazel Irvine. The 6-0 deficit in the first session must have taken a huge emotional toil. As for the champion? \u201cThank God I\u2019ve got a decent B-game to fall back on.\u201d Selby isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but he\u2019s a fantastic match-player and a worthy champion. The cheques are out. That\u2019s \u00a3330,000 to Mark Selby, and \u00a3137,500 to Ding Junhui. But the trophy is the main prize for Selby, followed by photo opportunities with spouse and bemused child. Ticker tape everywhere, adding a level of excitement to proceedings that the lack of coloured strips of paper simply couldn\u2019t provide. Any problems, Crucible types, see here. Quite the night for Leicester, all told, and Selby does his Foxes bit by holding his team\u2019s banner next to the trophy. Well done Selby, commiserations to Ding Junhui. A topsy-turvy final that never quite started to tip fully into the Chinese player\u2019s favour. AND IT\u2019S THERE. Ding needs snookers, but he\u2019s not going to get chance to make them, and he knows it. Handshake time. Selby looks like getting home with four frames to spare. For my part, I look like getting home with at least two trains to spare. It\u2019s 67-0 to Selby, with 67 left on the table. One more ball \u2026 Selby\u2019s armed with the experience of having been in this position two years ago, and he\u2019s wearing the pressure extremely well. A wobbly old red aside, the balls are being put away cleanly. Is this the last table visit of this year\u2019s championship? It could be. He\u2019s already 39-0 up in the frame. That frame broke an awkward spell for Selby, and he looks calm and assured with the reds well set. Incidentally, for those who don\u2019t want to know what happened in tonight\u2019s Premier League fixture, look away now, and try not to read the content of the Breaking News alert at the bottom of your browser window. At least one phone in the Crucible auditorium just chimed with the news, much to the annoyance of referee Paul Collier. Let\u2019s stick our collective necks out and suggest: possibly. A punishing period of tactical stuff is broken by a cracking double from Selby, but he plays it with safety-first in mind, and rolls up behind the black 40 ahead, with 43 left on the table. But then Ding cracks, leaving both of the remaining reds on, and Selby is on to the table like a lion on a gazelle. He gets over the line, and a 51-minute frame goes his way. Just one more frame needed for the world No1. FAO my wife: I\u2019m definitely not going to be out of work at 10. Can you feed the bunnies? Ta. It\u2019s fair to say that Selby is getting a bit more of the rub of the old green at this stage. A flick off the blue elevates a good-looking safety, leaving Ding in big trouble. But despite the obvious nerves, more calm hands give Selby something to think about. And, after a fashion, he conjures a lovely snooker, sending the ball across and up, leaving Ding needing to swerve the white from behind the brown. The fella can swerve the thing, no question about it. Too much as it turns out, resulting in a costly seven-point foul as he strikes the black. Attempt two is a lovely shot however, and they\u2019re going toe-to-toe with some cracking safety play here. Selby\u2019s nearly home in this frame, 43-7 up, but all the reds are now safe on the bottom cushion. That\u2019s better news for the world No1 than it is for Ding at this stage. And Selby\u2019s finding his range with his safety play too. Ding is 36 behind with just 51 on the table. Not that he\u2019s any slouch on the safety front himself \u2013 he\u2019s acquitted himself brilliantly at times in this match. Mark Williams \u2013 two-time champion at the Crucible \u2013 is getting butterflies just watching \u2026 Selby\u2019s looking a tiny bit ruffled here. Normally these tactical passages of play are to his liking, but his errors are irking him. He takes his time before addressing a long-ish red, cueing awkwardly over the blue. In. A phenomenal shot. But \u2013 not for the first time tonight \u2013 it\u2019s followed with something a bit average. Selby aims to cannon on a red but fails to make contact, instead flicking off the pink, leaving the cue ball some distance from his next object. Which he misses by some distance. Ding can\u2019t capitalise though, and badly misjudges his attempted red. Selby back at the table, puts the red Ding leaves away, and suddenly there\u2019s a bit of daylight in this frame \u2013 Selby 27-7 up. Ding\u2019s in a pickle here. The white is, unusually, touching two reds. He takes a seat on the cushion, cue almost vertical, and jabs tentatively down on to the cue ball. The white moves, but \u2013 crucially \u2013 neither of the reds budges. Good, calm hands. But he leaves it touching one of the reds, and so it\u2019s an easy safety for Selby, playing away. And he does more than a merely adequate job of putting the squeeze on Ding by tucking the white behind the brown. Advantage Selby? Ding overhits his next effort. However, the man from Leicester overcooks his positional shot from an easy red. He might have to opt for safety once more. Timely distraction from Alex Corcos \u2026 I\u2019ve heard it for the last time now and a mildly extensive Google search has yielded nothing: what is Ding\u2019s entrance music? It sounds promising Sadly Shazam decided to crash my phone when the players were coming out, so I failed to turn up an answer to this. Public hive mind \u2013 now is your time to shine. We were due a messy passage of play \u2013 and here\u2019s one. Selby, again with extensions to extensions at hand, fails to sink a regulation-looking pot and he\u2019s back in his seat 6-7 down in the frame, with safety-friendly reds everywhere. For those who don\u2019t like the tactical side of this sport, look away now. One-nil, to the Mark-Selby. Lovely plant from the Leicester man, making it work between two balls sitting some distance apart. Then he nestles behind the yellow to give Ding something to think about. A delicate dink off the side cushion looks like limiting the damage, but there\u2019s a red on to the left middle \u2026 Selby thinks better of it, and goes safe again. Good choice, because Ding ballses his next shot up quite badly. White in mid-table, red winking at the bottom right corner alluringly \u2013 seemingly a regulation pot for Selby. But he misses. It\u2019s a huge, huge let-off for Ding. But he can\u2019t capitalise, and only gets seven points on the board before missing a lengthy blue with the rest. Selby\u2019s back in. None of this tightly clustered pack nonsense this time around. Ding splits them up good and early. Ordinarily this would be good news for any decent pro, but it also means any missed red could be the last shot of the frame. Some good safety play from both men here \u2013 no balls down yet. I might have made a mistake by referencing banners incidentally. A fair bit of correspondence of differing quality on this subject. We\u2019re all about the little guy here at the Guardian though, so here\u2019s this from Ian, presumably, one of those Clapton Ultras \u2026 Enjoying your coverage this evening. Ultras banners are always on the large size \u2013 some as big as a snooker table. No A4 at Clapton. Ian. And I thought some of my links were tenuous. Shot of the evening \u2013 a ridiculous, thinly cut red, leaving the white careering horizontally several times. That brings up 98 for Ding. Then it\u2019s a formality to get over the century mark to 103. With three figures on the board however, he immediately dumps out, so no clearance this time. But those paying attention may note that he\u2019s creeping ever-closer to Selby now. Premier League, sch-memier league. All the cool kids are over this way. Ding\u2019s break crosses the half-century mark. He\u2019s not exactly got the ball on a string, as TV\u2019s finest like to put it, but is working hard to make this visit count. One more charge into the pack needed to free up some more options of a crimson bent \u2013 bootiful. And he\u2019s 65 ahead, with 75 still on the table. Then 66 ahead with an easy black to leave Selby needing to do his snooker-y thing. But I smell a century. Or not. A lovely long red from Ding. 16-14 has a nice ring to it for a plucky upstart. There\u2019s a long way to go before that though \u2013 a Hobbit\u2019s-handful of reds (to my mind, three) are available before further development is required. This is calm and assured stuff under the circumstances. He\u2019s 28 up, but a thwack into the bunch leaves a tricky red to the right centre. Suddenly he\u2019s 35-0 up with lots to play with. Selby to break after the mid-session interval. Tidy enough. Ding sends the cue ball back towards the green pocket, flirts with it suggestively, and leaves Selby with an awkward safety. The world No1 clips the object red far too thin, but the cue ball, between mid-table and baulk, has the blue between it and anything meaningful. His next safety is much better, and although Ding gets the white back up the table, Selby has a chance. No dice. But he plays it as a shot to nothing with enough weight to get tightish to the top cushion. We might have a few minutes of this. Bit of live-blogging housekeeping from eight days ago while I have a sec \u2026 In Lawrence Ostlere\u2019s mile-by-mile coverage of the London Marathon, he plugged in tweets from me giving sporadic from-the-roadside updates of the Guardian Sport entrants. We had Owen Gibson &gt; Sachin Nakrani &gt; Steve McMillan in the opening stages, which remained true until the boy Nakrani blew a gasket in the latter half, allowing the hobbled McMillan to romp on through. Unfortunately, what I failed to acknowledge is that the whippet-like youngling Alan Smith, also of this parish, was also in the race. And he beat the lot of them, with a fine time of 3hrs 15m 13sec. So belated congrats Alan. ATTEMPTED SEGUE: a while back Alan noted that he once took part in a race up against one Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan. Intriguingly, some of Ronnie times can be found in his profile on the Power of 10 website. I knew he enjoyed his running, but I had no idea he was quite that good. His Parkrun (5km) PB: 18m 8sec. So he has me licked by over six minutes (no gauge of class in itself by the way). Many thanks for everyone\u2019s correspondence (seven people now) suggesting various Leicester City/Ranieri/Dilly Ding snooker links to tie together all of tonight\u2019s potential sporting news. Much obliged, but just for the record I\u2019ve had it written in a pad since about 5pm on Friday. So if it comes to it, it\u2019s MINE. Back on crap holdy-uppy things in the crowd, important thoughts from our own Owen Gibson, which can apply to all sports everywhere \u2026 Let\u2019s be honest, 16-13 is not a lovely scoreline to be on the wrong end of in a first-to-18 match, but it\u2019s a hell of a lot better than 17-12. Ding is close to the line in this frame now. One more red \u2026 Clack. He visibly relaxes as the ensuing pink also goes down, reducing the possibility for the Selby snooker-a-tron kicking into life for the first time tonight. And Ding goes into the mid-session interval with a clearance of 70. As Lenny Kravitz once sang, much to my annoyance \u2026 Dunno. Looks more like a less terse Lord Kitchener to me. I am absolutely adamant that Alan McManus has something Smurf-y about him though. Paul Collier, officiating the final, shows his displeasure as another mobile chimes out, shattering the decorum at the table. Ding is not to be chimed out of his composure however, and his next shot is an outstanding, red-developing rasper. But with his break at the 22 mark, he gets an unfortunate double-kiss trying to play safe off the green. Selby has a red on \u2013 a fine-ish cut. It\u2019s close \u2026 but misses! Ding breathes again, and is back at the table. These are all huge moments for his chances now. Cracks in the Selby armour. A badly misjudged dink on to a red finishes short, and leaves Ding well set once more. But then Ding finishes short playing for the blue! Plenty of capacity for things to go badly wrong, but playing it round the green pocket with lots of side takes him back in touch with the reds. Clustered reds leaves lots of mileage in this frame however. Also available on the Guardian tonight, more sport with potentially news-making potential. Currently eight minutes in \u2026 A phenomenal long pot from Ding to get the scoreboard moving. But the ensuing yellow fails to drop. Mercifully, nothing of note left for Selby. Time for some safety, and we\u2019re soon in tippy tappy cluster territory. A re-rack looked a shoo-in, until Ding leaves the cue ball touching one of the reds. Easy safety for Selby, playing away. But then ANOTHER touching ball after a well-weighted effort back down-table by Ding. Meanwhile, this from the gorgeously named Riley Strother \u2026 Ahoy there, I am following along from the Race Rocks lighthouse perched on a tiny island off the west coast of British Columbia! Only about 10 miles from Victoria, hometown of Cliff Thorburn! It\u2019s too bad there aren\u2019t any top Canadian players anymore. Not like the 80s when there were 3 or 4! Although I read somewhere that Marco Fu grew up in Vancouver. Cheers, Riley Myself and Mrs Goodwin hit our 10-year anniversary mark next year and are heading Canada-wards. Don\u2019t suppose the lighthouse offers bed and board? Sounds marvellous. #shamelessblaggingends More phone-based dickheadedness in the crowd. Just put them on silent, folks. Ding composes himself and sinks an awkward black. Let\u2019s be honest, everything\u2019s awkward at this stage, particularly when you\u2019re five frames down to a player noted for closing matches out. But Ding gets over the line. He needed to seal the frame to leave himself with more than a margin of error to play with \u2013 and he has. Everyone\u2019s cashing out their Ding bets. Boo. There\u2019s life in this match yet \u2013 Ding\u2019s at the table, but there\u2019s plenty of work to do to develop some clustered reds. And develop them he does. Well, two of them anyway. I\u2019ve put it off for as long as I can. Time for The Safety Dance. Selby\u2019s tight on the bottom cushion, with very, very limited options to get the cue ball safe. He will be doing extremely well to make a shot and leave Ding without a red on. Almost three minutes after Selby took the table, he tries a tap off one cushion into the base of the cluster. But he leaves a red on for Ding to the right centre pocket. It creeps in. Great drama. Ding has cut a calm figure this evening but just before the crucial black in frame 27 his face was suddenly doused in sweat. If this match is to go much further he needs to rally in almost as grand a style as he managed at this time yesterday. Early stages of this frame, great pot from Ding cueing from the bottom cushion to sink a red into the right centre. Couple of shots later, time for another key black to take the cue ball into the clustered reds. Strong contact, unfortunate outcome. Not a lot immediately on. Black ball needed by Selby. He\u2019s well placed on the pink \u2026 But he fluffs his position. He needs to cut it in from a fine angle now. Ding towels his face as Selby lines the shot up. He makes it. It\u2019s an outrageously difficult shot in any circumstances. Pros all week have been referring to Selby as a superb match player \u2013 that\u2019s one reason why. Unbelievable. His position for the penultimate red finishes a fraction of a ball short, and the pot isn\u2019t on. The safety\u2019s just short of perfect, and Selby takes on a long red. Missed. Ding responds with a better safety, and a harder long pot faces the world No1. Fortune favours him as the missed red goes safe. Ding is 60-31 up, agonisingly short of a frame-clinching lead. Selby eyes up a flamboyant double into the middle pocket, with the cue ball travelling past from baulk down to the bottom cushion and back again. He makes it. Frame back in Selby\u2019s hands? Ding\u2019s tail is up. A brave cannon to develop two balls by the bottom cushion leaves all remaining reds with room the breathe. The Chinese player quickly takes the lead in the frame. A great attempt to rustle the pack from distance and develop matters further in his favour results in a touching ball, so Selby\u2019s contribution ends with him 27-0 up. Ding needs to head for the cluster off a side cushion. Attempt one stops well short. Attempt two taps them lightly, but Selby thinks he\u2019s left a red on. He chops down on the cue ball, applying left hand side, but has midjudged the gap to the object ball, and strikes another in between the two. No pot, but nothing left for Ding to score with. Selby then takes on a long red and misses by several inches, before the cue ball hammers into the cluster of reds. This is a crucial opportunity for the Chinese, with plenty of reds available. Last year\u2019s losing finalist laments \u2026 Ding breaks, before Selby fluffs an attempt to get the cue ball back behind the D. The Chinese then leaves the white tight to the baulk cushion once more. If he\u2019s been rattled during this match, his safety hasn\u2019t always shown it. A couple of shots later an attempted long red from Ding rattles the jaws but flies out, skirting with the opposite corner on its way back up the table. It\u2019s a longish red for Selby, but in it pops. He has the initiative again. When his eye\u2019s in he\u2019s an astonishingly clean potter. Selby adds a break of 46 to comfortably take the frame, and leaves himself just three short of a second World Championship title. If the next frame doesn\u2019t go Ding\u2019s way, it will take something dramatic, almost Mike Hallett-ian, to stop Selby taking the trophy. Selby\u2019s visit ends on 57 as he misses a red to the middle pocket by some distance. But not as much as Ding misses a longish red to the bottom corner. Lacked conviction, and this is now Selby\u2019s frame to lose. Meanwhile, Tim here fancies the match to finish this side of midnight \u2026 Ding is muttering to himself in the chair, and is clearly gutted at fluffing that early chance. Selby looks composed at the table and this is a good opportunity to build a big lead in the frame. The pink spot is tied up, so it\u2019s up with the yellow spot. Could be a factor. Selby\u2019s break is already 41. We go again. And this time we ain\u2019t stopping for nuthin\u2019. Still up for grabs: To the winner: \u00a3330,000 For the runner-up: \u00a3137,500 For the highest break: \u00a310,000 (currently Kyren Wilson\u2019s 143) Huge reception for Ding Junhui. Not unhuge for Selby either. Plenty of love in the room for both, but on noise alone, the Ding fans have it. Selby breaks, Ding misses long red and leaves it on. Another tab for your browsing this evening. Yes, yes I know you all love snooker and snooker only, but \u2026 Kick-off at Stamford Bridge is 8pm BST, but Tom Bryant is already in the chair, covering all the latest Thai Buddhist monk-related developments. Congrats to Burnley too \u2013 yo-yoing back up to the Premier League once more. Quick reminder for those who missed it earlier: I was booked to cover this live blog between the hours of 2pm-10pm today. Obviously given the nature of free-flowing sport, that\u2019s a guide, and I\u2019ll be here for the duration \u2013 and will whistle a happy tune throughout, I\u2019ll have you know. But let\u2019s see how accurate a guide that was. Last night\u2019s evening session finished after 12.30am, let\u2019s not forget. On this funtime bank holiday, my last train home is at \u2013 gulp \u2013 12.35am. The race is nearly on, ladies and gents. Get your finish time predictions in now \u2013 stuart.goodwin@theguardian.com or @stuartgoodwin. Oh banter how we do love thee \u2026 Before things ramp up again in Sheffield, a very quick nod to the landlord of The White Horse Inn in Westleton, Suffolk, where I recently found myself. Nothing to do with the fare on offer or anything, but because me and the Mrs eventually got to the bottom of why his voice was so familiar. He is the larynx twin of David Mitchell\u2019s character from the commentary box here \u2026 Back on birthday boy Jimmy White for a second, a look at the punditry lineups available to UK viewers today \u2026 Ronnie Wood! He played on the Stones\u2019 Black and Blue LP as well, although I don\u2019t think that was necessarily about snooker. \u201cThe first meaningless Rolling Stones album,\u201d according to Lester Bangs. The Whirlwind diehards still lament his absence from the World Championship, and he was dumped out of the first round of qualifying this year 10-9 by Northern Ireland\u2019s Gerard Greene. In fact a quick peek at the current world rankings reveals that he\u2019s currently the world no120, with circuit earnings this season of just \u00a3500. Two years ago he told Decca Aitkenhead: \u201cIf I didn\u2019t think I could still win the world title, I\u2019d stop playing.\u201d But it\u2019s now 10 years since his last appearance at the Crucible. Could he soon follow Steve Davis into retirement? For the few of you who haven\u2019t had the fact ramraided into your skulls in recent weeks, Mark Selby \u2013 a proud Leicester man \u2013 is an equally proud Leicester fan. On a tense day for him as a snooker professional, it\u2019s hard to imagine he won\u2019t be getting fed updates from Stamford Bridge tonight, solicited or otherwise. Those rowdy bloody snooker fans. The potentially crucial Chelsea v Spurs match will be getting the full MBM treatment shortly, but for those keeping an eye on Premier League title affairs while you keep tabs on all things baize-y, a few bits to whet your appetite: Jamie Vardy\u2019s having a party: Leicester players to watch Spurs at striker\u2019s house And he\u2019s won the Football Writers\u2019 award But Claudio Ranieri is being a good son and is prioritising lunch with his 96-year-old mum over keeping track of affairs off the Fulham Road Some good news for armchair fans who like their sport delivered terrestrially \u2026 Snooker\u2019s world championship will remain on terrestrial television until 2019 after the BBC secured a two-year extension to its deal. The agreement also includes broadcast rights for the UK Championship and Masters, the BBC said. Barbara Slater, the BBC Sport director, said: \u201cWe know there will be millions of snooker fans across the country celebrating the fact they can continue to watch world-class snooker on free-to-air television.\u201d Barry Hearn, chairman of World Snooker, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve agreed a new two-year extension with the BBC. We\u2019re now guaranteed on air until 2019 and I fancy quite a few more years after that.\u201d Full story below \u2026 Interesting observation on Twitter \u2026 Elsewhere, the world No77 is backing the world No1 \u2026 Meanwhile, in Peter Ebdon-world (although he does make a good point) \u2026 With the scores at 64-11 to Selby, a difficult cut on the black is frame ball. He avoids going in-off in the middle pocket, and is now in trademark territory: he has his opponent needing snookers, at the table with an inch-perfect safety leaving the cue ball tight on the baulk cushion. Ding\u2019s response is undercooked, but none of the reds are on. Two shots later Ding inadvertently sinks the cue ball in the green pocket while trying to play safe, immediately concedes, and that\u2019s that. Technically it\u2019s 4-4 this afternoon, but Selby clearly goes in the happier. With one more session to go in this year\u2019s tournament, Selby needs just four more frames. Today\u2019s scoring so far (Selby first): 7-121 (89), 56-61, 126-11 (126), 0-103 (103), 75-43 (52), 118-9 (68), 1-69 (52), 75-11 I\u2019m here until the bitter end, whenever that may be. The players are due back out again at 7pm BST. Next stop: a sarnie and some fresh air. Back shortly. At 55-4 up, a difficult clipped red into the middle pocket from Selby fails to drop. A huge, huge let-off for Ding. But two balls later, an awful positional shot for the next red leaves nothing on. Hard to tell exactly what he was playing for there. Whatever it was, it didn\u2019t work. And his attempted safety with the extension and the rest is undercooked - Selby\u2019s 44 ahead, with 75 remaining on the table. He eyes up a long red, and sinks it. For an allegedly tedious player, once Selby gets in he doesn\u2019t hang around. Already the break\u2019s well over 40 points, but he\u2019s running out of easy reds. It will be seriously impressive for him to seal the frame at this visit. An attempted flick off two cushions fails to land, and Ding has the cue ball put back for Selby to try and repeat the trick. And what a trick it is. There\u2019s reds on for Ding but nothing straightforward so he opts for safety once more. Selby licks his lips and lines up a long one of his own. Incha get, clean as a whistle. Lots of reds for him to play with now, but with the black tied up this might be a break featuring at least one or two blues. So will we go into tonight 14-11 or 13-12? Three frames ahead with four needed would put Selby in an incredibly strong position, but a one-frame gap would make it anybody\u2019s. Solid safety early on from Ding, replied to in kind by a deft, cluster-busting safety from Selby. There\u2019s reds on, but Ding opts to play safe, and leaves the world No1 tight on the baulk cushion, and in all kinds of trouble. He can see plenty of reds, but will do incredibly well to find a route back up the table from here. Arguably more by luck than judgment, Ding gets over the line to reduce the deficit to two frames. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve seen the last replay of that huge kick on the pink. Pivotal moment? An emerging theme to Ding in this match has been that the longer he takes over his shot selection, the more likely that it\u2019s not going to pan out as planned. He lets Selby in with a careless attempted safety. But what an awful kick Selby gets on a tricky pink into the middle pocket. He swipes at the air with his cue in frustration, and looks absolutely furious. A huge, huge let-off for Ding. Having looked every bit like bottling this frame, he\u2019s suddenly on the verge of taking it. Unless there\u2019s a tongue in the cheek here, Neil Richards is #teamebdon \u2026 And duly, Ding runs a crucial six inches out of position, leaving a difficult black. He sinks it to go 52 ahead, with 91 remaining. Mercifully, he refuses to try and make an exceptionally difficult plant, and opts to play safe. Ding could be in here. Last night he took these kind of opportunities well, but amid the pressure of his first World Championship final every shot feels like it should kick the momentum either way. He\u2019s quickly 44-0 up in the frame, but the rest is out again \u2026 Two frames left in the session. Selby breaks. Ding sinks a long red. There\u2019s a pattern here, but what happens in the next five minutes could go a long way to dictating the destiny of the match. It feels an awful lot like a must-win frame for the Chinese. The world No1 closes out with a break of 68, slamming the black away aggressively to take the frame 118-9. At one point that frame looked like leaving us with a scoreline of Selby 12-11 Ding. In a match of pivotal frames, that could be a telling gap. With another three-frame cushion beckoning for Selby, a red up the rail refuses to drop. The ensuing miss from Ding feels crucial, and he overcuts it horribly. Extend-o cue time again from Selby, and that\u2019s a huge reprieve. It\u2019s been far from vintage from him this afternoon, but he\u2019s injected just enough quality at crucial times to keep Ding lagging behind. He takes the score past the point of snookers being needed and is on the verge of guaranteeing a lead for the final session. Simon McMahon is sort of with me on the forced fun of the Crucible banners (see 15.46), although I do not endorse the quality of his puns. Actually now I say that, the extension one would have been ideal a few minutes ago. You\u2019re not wrong about the embarrassingly naff \u2018Ton Up\u2019 posters. They should hand out blank ones like they do at the darts for punters to write their own messages on. \u2018Ding Dong battle\u2019, \u2018Look at the size of my extension\u2019, \u2018Is snooker past its Selby date?\u2019, that sort of thing. The possibilities are endless. Ding breaks. Selby rolls delicately into the pack off the side cushion. The Chinese judges his safety well, but leaves a tempting red on. Badly misjudged by the world No1. This a potentially useful position for Ding \u2013 all the more so after a gorgeous black into the middle pocket which spins around the yellow pocket and back down to a brace of loose reds. Shortly after however, another attempted black misses by some distance. But not as much as Selby\u2019s attempted safety misses by \u2013 he aims to flick off a red and back into baulk, but pings the white around the table to leave it almost level with the pink. Is there a window through a couple of reds to knock in the inviting ball by the bottom left corner? Ding thinks so. But if there was, he failed to find it, and the resulting shot looks amateurish. Then Selby fails to tap in the same red from distance, though leaves Ding looking to pot his way out of trouble. Another miss. Selby\u2019s at the table, 8-9 down, and suddenly there\u2019s all manner of extensions to extensions needed to get his cue all the way up the length of the table to try and tap in a red that\u2019s no more than 12 inches from the pocket. He makes it. But this is an ugly frame so far, and soon he\u2019s out of position again 16-9 up. With only the colours left, and Selby 66-43 up, Ding fluffs an attempted safety. Awkwardish yellow goes down, and Selby\u2019s back in charge. Quietly, he\u2019s closing in on the 18 frames required. There have been several references to China grinding to a halt while this match is on, most recently from Barry Hearn on the BBC. Expected viewing predictions vary wildly, but let\u2019s just say this match, the first to feature a player from Asia, is not going unnoticed in the country of Ding\u2019s birth. The break\u2019s at 31, but sloppy positional play grinds Ding to a halt. Selby responds with his best shot of the afternoon so far \u2013 an outstanding long red to swing the momentumometer back in his direction. There\u2019s no quickfire century from Selby this time though, and Ding is back at the table, 14-8 down. Bit of safety, followed by another deliciously clean long red into the bottom left pocket. Plenty of reds to play with here for the Chinese. An alehouse-level break from Selby, leaving the cue ball closer to the left middle pocket than the top cushion. Ding looks like getting among the balls immediately, but tricky bridging tight to the cushion forces the miss on an otherwise straightforward-looking red. So Selby is quickly reprieved. His capacity for brushing off adverse situations is seriously impressive. News you might have missed last night incidentally \u2013 in fact news published so late it almost missed the final edition of today\u2019s paper, thanks to the late finish in Sheffield \u2026 Crucible set for World Snooker Championship contract extension The contract with The Crucible comes to an end next year and there had been speculation that the world championship \u2013 which earns \u00a35m for Sheffield over the 17 days of the competition \u2013 could leave the city and even move abroad \u2026 Jason Ferguson, chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, told The Guardian: \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us in the sport have the heart to change. We\u2019ve had substantial offers to move the world championship. But what price do you put on history? What price do you put on heritage? On those wonderful photographs you see when you walk backstage? Taking snooker away from here would be like taking the Wimbledon tennis championships away from Wimbledon. \u201cI\u2019m hoping for a long-term deal \u2013 and I\u2019m hoping an announcement will be made very shortly.\u201d The full story from Paul Weaver can be found here. Going back a bit, during Selby\u2019s semi-final victory over Marco Fu, there was the brain-aching proposition of a 76min 11sec frame, a Crucible record. To put that into perspective, you could watch James Whale\u2019s Frankenstein in its entirety, and then watch the YouTube video of Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s record-breakingly-fast 147 from 1997. And still have caught the first and last shots of the frame. Speaking of Hendry, he took a bit of flak online about his views on Selby\u2019s playing style. Which, to be honest, I thought were fairly well balanced. Selby will never be a rip-roaring crowd-pleaser in the White/O\u2019Sullivan/Trump mould, but he has tournament play down to a pretty fine art. And however distracted some sectors of the audience find themselves by some of his relentless safety play, it is mesmerising. Imagine being in the seat by the table watching it, knowing you\u2019re consistently a minute and a half away from having another puzzle to deal with. Ding crosses the 100 barrier, sticks out his tongue, and the \u2013 let\u2019s face it, bloody awful \u2013 \u201cTON UP\u201d banners are raised in the crowd. No total clearance, but that\u2019s his 14th century of the tournament, just two behind Stephen Hendry\u2019s World Championship record. We\u2019re going to 11-10, and this seesawing match is tightening up again. Mid-session interval time. Pretty sensibly, he\u2019s opted to try and seal the frame as opposed to going for the maximum. 56-0 up he plays for the blue. Six reds and six blacks from Ding so far in this break. Surely not \u2026 That was a great reaction from Selby. But again he\u2019s uncharacteristically sloppy with the safety at the start of the next frame. Ding needed to shake that last frame off and it looks like he has. Throughout the match the room has seemed to be on Ding\u2019s side. And not just them, if you believe the testimony of Eric Bristow. The MBE is apparently Massive Billiards Expert \u2026 That\u2019s century No9 for Selby at this year\u2019s tournament. Once again he\u2019s shown that he\u2019s as dangerous when things aren\u2019t going his way as when they are. 84th century at the Crucible in all for 2016, closing in on the record of 86. A stunning pink is coupled with splendid position rolling round the cushions to leave a delicate black \u2013 that\u2019s a pretty remarkable break of 126 under the circumstances. Selby, perhaps sensing he\u2019s up against it, has raised the pace, taking his break past the half-century. Ding already requires snookers in this frame, and Selby is showing no sign of letting this one go. Lucy Reynolds evokes a quite beautiful image \u2026 The 1979 world champion is nowadays a renowned coach in the game, working with a host of players including Ding and Barry Hawkins this season. Frankly, I can\u2019t imagine many things more soothing than a talking-to from Terry. My nan lived in Caenarvon for years and even when she lost her rag with me it was like having a bedtime story read to you. Selby breaks, Ding replies with a strong safety tight to the cushion. Selby inadvertently pots the black to give away seven points, and Ding puts away another great long red. Only he can\u2019t hold the table, and an attempted red nestles in the jaws of the pocket invitingly. Selby has a chance, albeit an awkward one with the pink locked tight to the top of a cluster of reds. But then an aggressive black develops things nicely. Lots to play with here. Ding clears the table, giving himself a little pep up as the black goes in. The gap is down to one. Ding was one ball away from being 7-0 down at one point, let\u2019s not forget. Don\u2019t forget also that the Chinese, currently ranked No17 in the world, had to go through qualifying this year. This has not been the quietest month of his life. This feels like a crucial moment in the context of the match. If Selby can hang on, it\u2019s vital breathing space at a time when things aren\u2019t necessarily going his way. If Ding can come back to just one frame behind, you\u2019d back him to close the gap all the way on the last hour\u2019s evidence. He has Selby in no end of trouble here with some glorious snookers. The world No1 escapes from his latest effort off two cushions, but Ding puts away a stunning red as clean as you like from the tightest of angles. Ding has the table, but with some unusually-placed colours to contend with. The frame is almost 50 mins old incidentally. Selby\u2019s 52-22 up but Ding is holding his own marvellously on the safety front. He puts Selby into no end of trouble with a snooker behind the pink, and an aggressive escape leaves an inviting long red into the yellow corner to seal the frame. Eek. Missed. And now Selby has applied thumbscrews with a pig of a snooker needing the help of cushions that haven\u2019t always obliged in recent weeks. At the second attempt, Ding needs to hit to avoid needing extras of his own. Not only does he escape, he flukes the snooker of his own. Selby almost snookers him again, but not quite. The rub of the green is definitely with the Chinese first-time finalist this afternoon. Selby ends his break at 36, needing one more red and a decent colour to leave Ding looking for snookers. A great effort from the Chinese puts Selby into trouble of his own, however. John S asks \u2026 If Ding wins, would this be the first Crucible winner that lives in Sheffield, and if so are we allowed to use the word \u201cirony\u201d in that eventuality? Answers on a postcard, Guardianistas. First of those spells where the momentum drops, people go to make a cuppa and Peter Ebdon leans into the screen, licking his lips. Yet another fine red by Ding followed by a fluffed colour (a tricky pink, with hampered bridging). Selby is as the table, 28-21 up, and with some clever positional play suddenly things are looking decently set, even though nothing but the blue is on its spot. Back on the fatigue question, this from Gary Naylor \u2026 I have to say, some of the crowd reactions to commentary feeds that a sizeable number of fans are checking into via headphones has been clearly unsettling to the players throughout the tournament. It must be incredibly weird when a murmur of laughter breaks out for no apparent reason while you\u2019re sizing up your options. Dare I say it, it\u2019s been a bit Radio 4ish audience behaviour as well. All a bit: \u201cI should probably laugh at that as other people are doing it.\u201d Irrespective of the actual humour content. More mistakes here in a match that\u2019s been full of them in among some majestic potting and safety play. Ding misjudges his safety to dump the cue ball straight in, and Selby\u2019s slightly appalled with himself after leaving a selection of long reds on with his attempted safety back up the table. Ding, with no clear path from the pot to a colour, spins it monstrously and aggressively through a host of reds huddled in the corner to force its way into some open table. A brave shot and one that gives him another great chance. There are three reds close to cushions though \u2013 this could take a while. With little on, Ding closes his break at 13 and goes safe once more. Selby at the table, 16-20 down in the frame. David Wall\u2019s been in touch. Feel free to do the same: stuart.goodwin@theguardian.com or @stuartgoodwin. It was probably the 15th, marathon frame last night that caught the headlines, but I thought the last one was fascinating in its own way. Both players started making mistakes that you\u2019d be embarrassed to make at your local club (or even on the pool table in the pub). It\u2019s not often that you see the effects of mental fatigue so obviously, but both players seemed to be almost falling asleep at the table and could barely carry out otherwise routine shots as a result. Of course, it\u2019s magnified in a sport like snooker, but it just highlighted how important mental alertness, as well as physical fitness, is in top level sport. Agree completely. Selby\u2019s eyes were a picture as play slipped past midnight. It often gets forgotten that Dennis Taylor\u2019s famous victory over Steve Davis was a match strewn with errors in the closing stages. There is always drama when fatigue hits. The Hustler taught us this. Hell, Rocky II taught us this. A stunningly clean long pot from Ding. The corner pockets are like a yawning Pac-Man to him from distance so far this afternoon. An awkward yellow takes him back towards the reds, and there\u2019s options to play with. But in taking a tricky shot with the rest \u2013 with which he\u2019s had mixed success in this game \u2013 he fails to make it count. But again Selby can\u2019t capitalise. And his next attempt at a safety isn\u2019t brilliant either. Ding breaks, and after Selby opts to go safe on the bottom cushion instead of going back to baulk, the Chinese puts away a long red into the yellow pocket beautifully. Big chance. However, he overruns when playing for the next red, and in opting to take it on, smashes the cluster wide open while missing by some distance. Selby\u2019s at the table, but his positioning\u2019s off too. An awkward brown puts him back among the balls however. First sustained spell at the table for the 2014 champion. After flagging up a disturbance in the crowd, Selby gets down and fluffs his positional shot horribly. 12-4 Selby in the frame, and his attempted safety isn\u2019t great either. The frame is Ding\u2019s as he calmly keeps building a break past the 80 mark. He falters at 89, but that will help calm his nerves. It needs pointing out however that this year\u2019s championship is a world where giving away 16 points in fouls is no impediment to Selby keeping his side of the ticking clocking along. The phrase \u201cMark Selby requires three snookers\u201d does not necessarily mean he\u2019s out of these frames. There\u2019s some nervous stuff going on here already. Ding offers Selby the chance of an opening by leaving a red close to the pocket, but \u2013 still \u2013 it\u2019s no gimme, and the world No1 fails to take advantage. The Chinese \u2013 famously the first Asian player to make the Crucible final \u2013 makes no mistake next time and he\u2019s back at the table with the reds placed pretty promisingly. That blue, an inch off the top cushion, is out of commission as far as break-building is concerned and Ding is strong favourite for this frame now. The famously patient Peter Ebdon is loving this incidentally \u2026 here\u2019s his thoughts on Selby: Ding puts the cue ball into the baulk area after a neat break of 32, to give him a 32-1 lead in the frame. We\u2019re into safety territory already. First miss of the day: Ding rattles the jaws with a long red. First pot of the day: Selby puts a red away, but immediately fluffs a blue, which goes safe. Early opportunity for Ding. Ding enters first, with his snazzy red waistcoat. Little wry grin, giving little away. Selby checks his cuetip, and gives a jaunty wave as he passes the World Championship trophy, clad in his gloriously retro grey garb. Selby will break first. The story so far \u2026 In short: Mark Selby (Eng) leads Ding Junhui (Chn) 10-7 (Selby first) 125-8 (91), 70-68 (52), 101-43 (76), 124-0 (120), 100-0 (70), 77-38, 47-68, 14-107, 73-22, 30-92 (76), 1-103 (103), 49-93 (89), 71-1, 0-86 (86), 52-82 (55), 86-25, 67-27 In long: this is not over, and may not be for quite some time. Two sessions to go, at 2pm and 7pm. First to 18, and the world No1 Selby has shown that he has two wildly different gears to play with. There\u2019s the clinical, break-making virtuosity as evidenced at key times of Sunday\u2019s first session, where he compiled breaks of 91, 76, and 120. But in making his way to a daunting 6-0 lead, the 32-year-old from Leicester also showcased his capacity for cruelty. His safety play is not just a thing of art, it is absolutely relentless. Still, despite his unflashy style, he\u2019s a very human player, Hulk-smashing the table after key pots, and with the capacity to miss key balls at crucial times. A tricky blue into the yellow pocket could have tied up a 7-0 lead, but instead he let Ding in. And in he stayed. 6-0 became 6-2 at the end of the first session. And despite Selby taking the first frame of the evening, it soon became 7-5. By half past midnight in Sheffield, we were close to matters being very tight at 9-8. But Selby, clearly fighting away the sleepydust, took the final frame of the session, held his cue aloft as if he\u2019d won the whole thing, and went to bed with a three-frame cushion. Mathematically, Selby could seal the win in the afternoon session. Realistically, however, I\u2019ve already got a printout of the last bank holiday trains home to hand.",

Selby rolls delicately into the pack off the side cushion. The Chinese judges his safety well, but leaves a tempting red on. Badly misjudged by the world No1. This a potentially useful position for Ding \u2013 all the more so after a gorgeous black into the middle pocket which spins around the yellow pocket and back down to a brace of loose reds.</p> <p>Shortly after however, another attempted black misses by some distance. But not as much as Selby\u2019s attempted safety misses by \u2013 he aims to flick off a red and back into baulk, but pings the white around the table to leave it almost level with the pink.</p> <p>Is there a window through a couple of reds to knock in the inviting ball by the bottom left corner? Ding thinks so. But if there was, he failed to find it, and the resulting shot looks amateurish.</p> <p>Then Selby fails to tap in the same red from distance, though leaves Ding looking to pot his way out of trouble. Another miss. </p> <p>Selby\u2019s at the table, 8-9 down, and suddenly there\u2019s all manner of extensions to extensions needed to get his cue all the way up the length of the table to try and tap in a red that\u2019s no more than 12 inches from the pocket. He makes it. But this is an ugly frame so far, and soon he\u2019s out of position again 16-9 up.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Livesnooker/status/727160903121117184\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Is this the biggest cue in Snooker history?! <a href=\"https://t.co/ierEidLKiW\">pic.twitter.com/ierEidLKiW</a></p>&mdash; Live Snooker (@Livesnooker) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Livesnooker/status/727160903121117184\">May 2, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-03T23:55:18.048Z\">at 12.55am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-572771c7e4b0f300275c838e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-02T15:29:50.755Z\">4.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Selby 12-10 Ding (75-43)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With only the colours left, and Selby 66-43 up, Ding fluffs an attempted safety.

      "bodyText": "The young Somali woman who set herself alight on Nauru \u2013 the second refugee in a week to do so \u2013 has been taken to Australia by air ambulance, but her situation remains critical. Hodan, 21, doused herself and set herself alight inside the OPC1 section of the detention centre on Nauru. According to reports, she suffered severe burns to most of her body. One person reported \u201call of her clothes were burned off\u201d. Another source said: \u201cOne of the witnesses who saw her said the situation is much worse than Omid,\u201d a reference to 23-year-old Omid Masoumali, who died last week after self-immolating on Nauru. Other refugees were prevented by police from entering the hospital to see Hodan (spelled Hadon on her immigration department records) but said that she must be medically evacuated as quickly as possible after accusations of delays in treating Masoumali. An air ambulance arrived overnight on Nauru to transport Hodan to Australia. She arrived mid-morning in Brisbane. Sources on Nauru say she has suffered severe burns to her upper body and face. The incident will increase the pressure on the Australian government to improve conditions on Nauru and at its other offshore detention centre on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Despite Labor supporting the government\u2019s policy of refusing settlement for refugees arriving by illegal boats, the party\u2019s immigration spokesman Richard Marles said it was leaving people without hope. Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull \u201cmust urgently seek a viable agreement to resolve the fate of people on Manus Island and Nauru\u201d, Marles said on Tuesday. Hodan was forcibly returned to Nauru only last Wednesday. She was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident on Nauru last November, and was brought to Australia for medical treatment. In the early hours of the morning last Wednesday, Australian Border Force guards carried her out of the Brisbane immigration transit accommodation (Bita) holding her by her arms and legs as she screamed to be allowed to stay. Sources on the island say Hodan\u2019s self-immolation was her second attempt at suicide since being returned to the island. Hodan had been held on Nauru for three years before she was moved to Brisbane. Friends described her as a \u201cgentle soul\u201d who had been \u201cdestroyed\u201d by her time in detention. Masoumali set himself alight at Nibok refugee settlement on Nauru last Wednesday in the presence of representatives from the United Nations. Video footage shot on a mobile phone, which Guardian Australia has chosen not to publish, shows him dousing himself in accelerant and shouting: \u201cThis is how tired we are; this action will prove how exhausted we are. I cannot take it any more\u201d. He then sets himself alight. Masoumali\u2019s widow, also a refugee, has been critical of the delay in getting him care on Nauru. She says it was hours before he was given painkillers. It was more than 22 hours before he was taken to a Brisbane hospital. Video footage of Masoumali at Nauru hospital shows him clearly conscious as he paces up and down while screaming \u2013 with severe burns apparent to his arms, legs, chest and back \u2013 while distressed friends plead for him to be given assistance. A second clip shows doctors and nurses struggling to administer painkillers, as Omid, still standing, continues to scream. People watching nearby are vomiting. Masoumali\u2019s widow told Guardian Australia her husband was not given a sheet or a place to lie down, and that the hospital \u201cdidn\u2019t even have a clean syringe\u201d. \u201cStaff in Nauru hospital couldn\u2019t help Omid in any way because they were unequipped,\u201d she said. \u201cA lack of proper equipment and facilities was the reason that staff couldn\u2019t help and treat Omid in the Nauru hospital.\u201d On Monday, she said she was being kept in a Brisbane hotel by immigration authorities, denied access to a lawyer and sedated. The Nauru government has said Masoumali received \u201cthe highest level of care\u201d. But Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said there was \u201can epidemic of self-harm at Nauru\u201d \u201cA vulnerable young woman who needed protection was a victim of a spiteful removal. She has been sent to the toxic environment that the minister has created on Nauru. Tragically this was entirely predictable.\u201d Current Australian government policy \u2013 support by both major parties \u2013 mandates that no asylum seeker who arrives, or attempts to arrive, by boat will ever settle in the country. Instead they are sent to the two offshore processing facilities on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, or Nauru, ostensibly for processing, followed by repatriation or resettlement in a third country. However, in practice, it has resulted in indefinite detention, with fewer than five resettlements in Cambodia and PNG (Nauru does not offer permanent resettlement) from more than 2,000 people in detention. New Zealand has offered to take refugees, but Australia has refused this, saying it was a \u201cback door\u201d to entering Australia. Last week the PNG supreme court ruled the detention on Manus Island was illegal and unconstitutional, and its government announced closure of the Manus Island facility. Since then, the Australian government has been scrambling for a solution, and detainees in both centres have become increasingly distressed amid the confusion. The United Nations has said Australia\u2019s offshore detention regime is acutely damaging, and called for refugees and asylum seekers to be removed from their current detention. Catherine Stubberfield, spokesperson for UNHCR\u2019s regional representation in Canberra, said there was \u201cno doubt that the current policy of offshore processing and prolonged detention is immensely harmful\u201d. \u201cThere are approximately 2,000 very vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru. These people have already been through a great deal, many have fled war and persecution, some have already suffered trauma. Despite commendable efforts by the governments of Papua New Guinea and Nauru, arrangements in both countries have proved completely untenable.\u201d Stubberfield said the mental health and physical wellbeing of people held in detention had deteriorated over time. \u201cThe consensus among medical experts is that conditions of detention and offshore processing do immense damage to physical and mental health. UNHCR\u2019s principal concern today is that these refugees and asylum seekers are immediately moved to humane conditions with adequate support and services to prevent further unnecessary suffering.\u201d The government of Nauru said it was \u201cdistressed that refugees are attempting such dreadful acts in order to attempt to influence the Australian government\u2019s immigration policies\u201d. It said refugee advocates, Australian politicians and human rights lawyers should \u201cwork with us in sending the message to refugees on Nauru that such drastic actions will not work, and to refrain from such protests\u201d. \u201cRefugee advocates must stop giving refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru false hope and stirring up these protests.\u201d Save the Children\u2019s chief executive Paul Ronalds said Australia needed to find permanent and workable solutions for those held on Nauru and Manus, who were being damaged by the ongoing uncertainty over their futures. \u201cWe know first-hand from our time on Nauru that prolonged and indefinite detention, and the uncertainty associated with a lack of permanent resettlement options for refugees on Nauru, causes serious harm. Recent events on both Manus and Nauru demonstrate the unsustainability of present arrangements, and that further serious and life-threatening incidents are inevitable.\u201d In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

      "bodyText": "Less than a year after his election as leader reignited the hopes of separatists in Quebec, media tycoon Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau has stepped down as the head of the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. P\u00e9ladeau said he had been forced to decide between his work and his family. \u201cI am forced to make a choice, an agonizing choice, between my family and my political project, our political project, which is shared by so many people,\u201d he told reporters in Montreal on Monday as he fought back tears. \u201cI have chosen my family.\u201d Earlier this year, P\u00e9ladeau, 54, split from his wife, television producer Julie Snyder. On Sunday, Snyder told a television talkshow program that the couple \u2013 who have three children among them \u2013 are in mediation. P\u00e9ladeau said the party would soon begin the search for an interim leader. \u201cI\u2019m making this decision for the good of my children,\u201d he added. \u201cI have to remain an example for them. I profoundly love the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, its activists and its (National Assembly) members.\u201d The former CEO of Quebecor, Canada\u2019s second biggest media group, P\u00e9ladeau burst onto the Canadian political scene in 2014, vowing to \u201cmake Quebec a country\u201d. He was elected as the PQ leader last May and since struggled to woo voters from the province\u2019s governing Liberal party. Heir to a media empire founded by his father, P\u00e9ladeau\u2019s election as leader earned him comparisons with Italian media magnate-turned-politician Silvio Berlusconi and injected a star quality into Quebec\u2019s separatist movement, amid concerns over dwindling membership numbers. In 1980, the party had 300,000 members; last year the figure had slipped to around 70,000. Recent polls suggest that most Quebeckers oppose sovereignty. Many within the party\u2019s left, however, found it hard to reconcile P\u00e9ladeau\u2019s call for an independent Quebec with his abysmal record on labour rights. His time at the helm of Quebecor was marked by conflict with labour unions, including 16 lockouts during strikes at Quebecor companies. Others questioned how P\u00e9ladeau would manage the glaring conflict of interest between his political power and Quebecor, which ranks as the main private media owner in Quebec. P\u00e9ladeau\u2019s solution was to put his shares in a trust. On Monday, P\u00e9ladeau promised to remain active within the party. \u201cI am convinced that the future of Quebec and Quebecers lies in the independence of our nation,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Do not adjust your reality: this really is happening. For the past three months Leicester City\u2019s gloriously bold progress towards a first English top-flight title has unfurled like a slow breaking wave. A draw against Manchester United on Sunday afternoon left Claudio Ranieri\u2019s collection of offcuts and rising talents a step closer. Tottenham\u2019s failure to beat Chelsea on Monday night was the final nudge. The wave has finally broken on a Premier League title some are already calling the most unlikely sporting victory of all time. The fairytale-ish aspects of this are well rehearsed. At the start of the season Leicester were 5,000-1 with bookmakers to win the league, a wager taken up by only 12 William Hill punters, among them the 39-year-old Leicester carpenter Leigh Herbert whose fiver, offered up in faith not hope, has now raked in \u00a325,000. Three months into the season, with Leicester already haring away at the top of the table, they were still 1,000-1 to win it. Still a freak, a blip, a hilarious blue-shirted glitch. And yet the most striking aspect of the season\u2019s endgame has been the beautifully controlled way Leicester have closed things out. It is only in the last few weeks that the realisation has dawned Leicester haven\u2019t just been edging this \u2013 they\u2019ve been running away with it, already out there on the victory lap of honour, ambling round the bases, high-fiving the bench, ball safely dispatched above the bleachers. The bald facts of the Leicester Supremacy are brilliantly stark. This is a club whose previous highest league position was a runners-up spot in 1929, who have been relegated or promoted 22 times in all. Too small to stay up, too big to stay down, Leicester are instead the ultimate ballcock team, clunking up and down between the divisions with reassuring regularity, an inbetweener club in a city on the way to somewhere else. In 2002 they nearly went out of business altogether but were rescued by a consortium led in part by their ex-player Gary Lineker, soon to present Match of the Day dressed in only his oversized Y-fronts, part of a sightly unnecessary early-season title bet. Two seasons ago they were fighting their way up out of the second tier. In February last year they were bottom of the Premier League and on their way down before a stunning late rally under Nigel Pearson, who was abruptly sacked. And now from nowhere we have this, a season that has quite literally morphed into a Hollywood script. Indeed a Jamie Vardy movie is already in pre\u2011production, based on the life and times of Leicester\u2019s improbable top scorer, a late-blooming, whippet-thin, scaldingly quick journeyman striker. Vardy once spent half a season being substituted after an hour at his non\u2011league club so he could rush home and make the curfew on his electronic tag, the result of a conviction for assault outside a pub. Champion\u2019s medal in hand, Vardy can now look forward to playing for England at this summer\u2019s European Championship. Really, though, it is Leicester\u2019s own story, the league title that wasn\u2019t supposed to be, that will be forcing the script-editors to rewrite. There have been surprising champions before. In the past 55 years Nottingham Forest and Ipswich Town have won the title the season after being promoted. That was then, though. In the violently stratified air of modern-day Big Football, a triumph like this seemed not just remote but impossible. The website Sporting Intelligence has calculated Manchester United have spent more on new players in the two-year reign of their current manager than the new champions have in their entire 132-year existence. There is no back route to the summit. The world has shifted. Some things simply can\u2019t happen any more. This has. How? The easiest way into the Leicester story is probably through the players themselves, a band of outsiders and left-field punts whose success seems to provide its own lesson in redemptive second chances. The captain Wes Morgan, a 31-year-old Jamaican international centre-back, was painfully exposed at times last season. Still slow, still bulky, he has been a joy to watch this year, a hugely intelligent defender, able to read and block and intercept with wonderful skill. Vardy\u2019s success is electrifying, a late\u2011career rise from non-league to national team that simply doesn\u2019t happen, can\u2019t happen, has happened. Riyad Mahrez, a rakish, mooching, sublimely skilful Algerian, was playing French second division football two years ago, considered too lightweight for the thunder of top-level football. Last week he was named player of the year in the world\u2019s most relentlessly concussive league. Overseeing this beachcomber\u2019s XI is a manager best known before now for coming second. It is hard not to love Claudio Ranieri, the brilliantly shrewd and funny Italian uncle you never had, and a manager who is often seen out and about in Leicester, eating in local restaurants, having a drink with fans, posing for endless patiently beaming selfies. Ranieri\u2019s genius has been to see what he\u2019s got, take a deep, fortifying sniff of that burgeoning team spirit and simply let it keep on ticking, tightening up the details on the hoof as the season has thrummed along. It should be said Leicester are not all unicorns and stardust. This is a tough, gnarly team that can hustle and grapple and work between the lines of the laws. Like pretty much every other successful team they have an ambitious billionaire owner, the Thai-Chinese duty free magnate Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, even if this one gives away free beer at home matches and flies in Buddhist monks to bless his players. Some still find Vardy hard to like after an incident, caught on camera, where he referred several times to an oriental casino worker as \u201cJap\u201d and later apologised for using racist language (this bit probably won\u2019t make the movie). For all that they remain something genuinely rare, near-universally popular champions in a toxic, tribal league, a team whose ability to thrill isn\u2019t confined to the extraordinarily uplifting atmosphere inside the King Power Stadium. Not to mention an object of global fascination thanks to the devastating power of the Premier League marketing machine. And why not? This is a genuine good news story, champions whose achievement cuts across entrenched barriers, vaults an impassible gulf of finance and privilege, a reprise of the most inspiring basic sporting principle of open competition. There is even a hint of a minor trend here. In Spain, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid continue to assert a similar principle, the idea that the wealthiest mega-clubs can outgrow their own strengths, overlooking the human-scale virtues of team-building and spirit in favour of an assemblage of stars, the idiot-culture of celebrity worship infecting sport as it has music, publishing and politics. In this equation Leicester are like some low-cost, bare-bones start-up, cleaning up in the space between the bloated corporate giants, a footballing Napster quietly shutting down the record labels. Who knows, perhaps we might even see an invisible barrier being broken here, just as when Roger Bannister broke the four-minute mile at Iffley Road, a mark previously considered beyond the scope of the human physique. Suddenly runners around the world began to find they could do the same. For now it is probably best simply to celebrate a rare, insurrectionist triumph. Viva Leicester!",

Vardy once spent half a season being substituted after an hour at his non\u2011league club so he could rush home and make the curfew on his electronic tag, the result of a conviction for assault outside a pub. Champion\u2019s medal in hand, Vardy can now look forward to playing for England at this summer\u2019s European Championship.</p> <p>Really, though, it is Leicester\u2019s own story, the league title that wasn\u2019t supposed to be, that will be forcing the script-editors to rewrite. There have been surprising champions before. In the past 55 years Nottingham Forest and Ipswich Town have won the title the season after being promoted. That was then, though.</p> <p>In the violently stratified air of modern-day Big Football, a triumph like this seemed not just remote but impossible. The website Sporting Intelligence has calculated Manchester United have spent more on new players in the two-year reign of their current manager than the new champions have in their entire 132-year existence. There is no back route to the summit. The world has shifted. Some things simply can\u2019t happen any more. This has. How?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/02/claudio-ranieri-leicester-premier-league-champions\">Claudio Ranieri proves nice guys do not always come second</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The easiest way into the Leicester story is probably through the players themselves, a band of outsiders and left-field punts whose success seems to provide its own lesson in redemptive second chances. The captain Wes Morgan, a 31-year-old Jamaican international centre-back, was painfully exposed at times last season. Still slow, still bulky, he has been a joy to watch this year, a hugely intelligent defender, able to read and block and intercept with wonderful skill.</p> <p>Vardy\u2019s success is electrifying, a late\u2011career rise from non-league to national team that simply doesn\u2019t happen, can\u2019t happen, has happened. Riyad Mahrez, a rakish, mooching, sublimely skilful Algerian, was playing French second division football two years ago, considered too lightweight for the thunder of top-level football. Last week he was named <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/24/leicester-riyad-mahrez-pfa-player-of-the-year\">player of the year</a> in the world\u2019s most relentlessly concussive league.</p> <p>Overseeing this beachcomber\u2019s XI is a manager best known before now for coming second. It is hard not to love Claudio Ranieri, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/29/claudio-ranieri-gentle-man-leicester-city-premier-league\">brilliantly shrewd and funny Italian uncle you never had</a>, and a manager who is often seen out and about in Leicester, eating in local restaurants, having a drink with fans, posing for endless patiently beaming selfies.</p> <p>Ranieri\u2019s genius has been to see what he\u2019s got, take a deep, fortifying sniff of that burgeoning team spirit and simply let it keep on ticking, tightening up the details on the hoof as the season has thrummed along. It should be said Leicester are not all unicorns and stardust. This is a tough, gnarly team that can hustle and grapple and work between the lines of the laws.</p> <p>Like pretty much every other successful team they have an ambitious billionaire owner, the Thai-Chinese duty free magnate Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, even if this one gives away free beer at home matches and flies in Buddhist monks to bless his players. Some still find Vardy hard to like after an incident, caught on camera, where he referred several times to an oriental casino worker as \u201cJap\u201d and later apologised for using racist language (this bit probably won\u2019t make the movie).</p> <p>For all that they remain something genuinely rare, near-universally popular champions in a toxic, tribal league, a team whose ability to thrill isn\u2019t confined to the extraordinarily uplifting atmosphere inside the King Power Stadium. Not to mention an object of global fascination thanks to the devastating power of the Premier League marketing machine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/02/chelsea-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\">Leicester celebrate first title after Chelsea recover for Tottenham draw</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And why not? This is a genuine good news story, champions whose achievement cuts across entrenched barriers, vaults an impassible gulf of finance and privilege, a reprise of the most inspiring basic sporting principle of open competition. There is even a hint of a minor trend here. In Spain, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid continue to assert a similar principle, the idea that the wealthiest mega-clubs can outgrow their own strengths, overlooking the human-scale virtues of team-building and spirit in favour of an assemblage of stars, the idiot-culture of celebrity worship infecting sport as it has music, publishing and politics.</p> <p>In this equation Leicester are like some low-cost, bare-bones start-up, cleaning up in the space between the bloated corporate giants, a footballing Napster quietly shutting down the record labels. Who knows, perhaps we might even see an invisible barrier being broken here, just as when Roger Bannister broke the four-minute mile at Iffley Road, a mark previously considered beyond the scope of the human physique. Suddenly runners around the world began to find they could do the same.</p> <p>For now it is probably best simply to celebrate a rare, insurrectionist triumph. Viva Leicester!</p>",

How extraordinary that Claudio Ranieri, once of this parish, a man who was removed from the Chelsea job during Roman Abramovich\u2019s first year of ownership, perhaps because of the reputation that he was not combative enough to win major honours, should experience the finest moment of his career thanks to events at Stamford Bridge. Mamma Mia. Even Claudio\u2019s 96-year-old mother, with whom he shared lunch on this astonishing day, could not have seen many tales quite like this. Leicester City are Premier League champions. They were helped over the line by the deposed title-holders as Chelsea showed the kind of defiant streak they seldom mustered this season to pierce a briefly buoyant Tottenham. Leicester\u2019s closest challengers, 2-0 up at half-time, brimmed with intent to fight to the last. But Chelsea\u2019s second-half riposte cut them down. The equalising goal, a superb arrowing strike from Eden Hazard, brought a theatrical end to it all. Guus Hiddink fielded a phone call from Ranieri shortly after the final whistle to hear heartfelt thanks. The Italian\u2019s voice was trembling. As climaxes go, this was of the purest nerve-shredding, tension-fuelled variety. It was also malevolent \u2013 as brutal physically as it was emotionally. Chelsea\u2019s role as kingmakers during this title finale provoked them into some spark and spite. That was the dominant tone for a feisty encounter that was on the limit of control from the moment the ball began rolling. At times provocation and reactions crashed over the line of acceptability and when the dust settles both teams may well face consequences. As Tottenham\u2019s fading league hopes evaporated their discipline lapsed completely. Twice Mauricio Pochettino, who spent most of the evening pacing his technical area like a coiled spring, raced on to the pitch to deal with altercations. At the end of the game chaos engulfed the route into the tunnel and Hiddink ended up sprawling. The Dutchman took it in good spirits. His Argentinian counterpart did his utmost to explain it all away as one of those things under the circumstances. \u201cThis is the end of the season, the emotion, we are human,\u201d he said. Hiddink, who played the role of peacemaker frequently, had some sympathy. \u201cThere was a lot at stake for them and for us prestige was at stake. It was an emotional game between two big clubs. I had to come in between a lot of people.\u201d The worst of the episodes involved Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, who gouged at Diego Costa\u2019s eyes during a wider m\u00eal\u00e9e sparked by a confrontation between Danny Rose and Willian. Retrospective punishment is likely to be on the agenda. Cesc F\u00e0bregas accused \u00c9rik Lamela of stamping on his hand. Some of the tackles were more suited to rugby by the end. Frankly it was almost impossible for Mark Clattenburg to keep up, and there were 12 yellow cards (it could have easily been worse). Frantic is something of an understatement. The hostilities were helterskelter, with a screeching tempo in front of a salty atmosphere. Somewhere amid this ferocity Tottenham\u2019s mission was to find composure. The game\u2019s pendulum swung in the 33rd minute as they broke to seize the lead. The move was based on slick build-up play on the edge of the box as the ball was pinged from Christian Eriksen to Lamela, who prodded forwards to Harry Kane. Tottenham\u2019s top scorer, who found time in possession hard to come by during this breathless wrestle, was suddenly handed one of those moments where the clock almost slowed. Played onside by John Terry, Kane enjoyed a moment of clarity. He sidestepped Asmir Begovic and planted the ball in the net. The England striker was elated to claim his 14th goal in his last 15 games. The Tottenham celebrations increased shortly before half-time when they doubled their lead. Kane won the ball in midfield and there was Eriksen, who orchestrated beautifully once again. His subtle pass, shifting play forwards and into Son Heung-min\u2019s path, unlocked the door for the South Korean to finish crisply. Chelsea did not appear to have the quality to match from a technical point of view, and at half-time Hiddink introduced Hazard for the largely ineffective Pedro. The home team found refreshed verve. Just before the hour mark they found a method to finally make a footballing impact. Willian\u2019s floated corner fell for Gary Cahill, who escaped Toby Alderweireld to unleash some of Chelsea\u2019s frustration bylashing the ball past Hugo Lloris. The mood changed. A minute later Costa raced goalwards only to tumble before he could shape to shoot. Chelsea sensed an opportunity to sting their old foes. Willian was the next with a chance but Lloris saved capably. Chelsea threatened again when a ball flashed across the face of goal and Walker just managed to clear as Costa lurked for a tap-in. Then came Hazard\u2019s blistering coup de grace. \u201cAfter the whole season and the dream to be champion it is difficult to take off this feeling,\u201d said Pochettino. \u201cOur players are disappointed and sad we need to feel that for the future.\u201d On Sunday 15 May the visitors here at Stamford Bridge will be Leicester.

      "bodyText": "Things are getting complicated in Marcella land, with yet more characters and the grim subject of child abduction thrown into the mix. It\u2019s chaotic, convoluted and increasingly hard to follow, but I do have a sneaking admiration for the show for chucking everything at the wall and seeing what sticks. Detective. Witness. Suspect A good week for our titular crime-solver, who looks to finally be off the hook for Grace Gibson\u2019s murder, and managed to eke out an admission of guilt from her old adversary Peter Cullen. Cullen\u2019s confession came at the end of a lengthy interrogation scene in which Marcella used every last trick in the book \u2013 spraying herself in the perfume Cullen bought for Maddy, questioning his abilities in the bedroom and playing to his vanity by declaring him nothing more than a \u201cpiss-pot copycat killer\u201d. At that point, Cullen couldn\u2019t bear to be considered some ersatz Grove Park wannabe and confessed to all the original murders. That he did so without a lawyer present doesn\u2019t seem to have been a problem for anyone involved, least of all the show\u2019s writers. Cullen managed to get a few decent jabs in himself, twigging that Marcella had separated from Jason and highlighting the shared fear he and Marcella have in being \u201creplaced\u201d by their partners. The old \u201cwe\u2019re not so different, you and I\u201d trope has been done to death in detective dramas, but this was an effective spin on it, mainly because we know that Marcella, like Cullen, is capable of acts of violence. There was some nice tense back and forths between the pair, with Cullen trying to goad Marcella into a moment of rage by mentioning \u201clittle Juliette\u201d, whose birthday it is. Just what happened to her 11 years ago, and why does Cullen seem to know the ins and outs of it? Marcella\u2019s second big victory of the week came when she managed to link the Grove Park killer \u2013 or rather the copycat \u2013 to Grace Gibson\u2019s death, effectively absolving herself. It was rather fortunate that Cara\u2019s friend Leah was wearing the same drug-filled necklace the killer took as a trophy from Grace, and managed to get arrested, putting her in direct contact with the police, but hey, I\u2019m sure Marcella will take it. She probably shouldn\u2019t put up the \u201cI\u2019m not guilty\u201d bunting just yet \u2013 there\u2019s still the testimony to come of Mo, the cab driver working illegally for Hassan. Hassan was murdered this week by an unknown assailant, after revealing to Marcella that Mo had seen a woman carrying a heavy object out of Gibson\u2019s flat. The team are already on Mo\u2019s trail \u2013 I have a feeling that he might point the finger of blame at Marcella when they do track him down. Also under suspicion While Cullen has taken the rap for those original killings, there\u2019s still the more recent crimes left to solve, most notably the attack on the old man last week. The hotel keycard dropped during that botched effort links to Bendik, but while he\u2019s definitely a wrong\u2019un, CCTV footage shows that a hooded figure nabbed his keycard after he handed it back in. Who could that hooded figure be? Well, bizarrely there\u2019s a chance it\u2019s Matthew, Henry\u2019s mate and head of the IT firm that set up the computer used by the person who threatened Cara shortly before she died. (I did say it was convoluted!) Matthew doesn\u2019t look the type to threaten webcam girls and stick plastic bags over people\u2019s heads, but what about his boyfriend Yann? I\u2019m guessing he could get access to the computer through Matthew, and he\u2019s certainly exhibiting enough telling weirdo traits. His surprise for Matthew, an exact recreation of their first meal together, came off as more creepy than caring, especially when he decided to interrupt their date with a tirade about Matthew\u2019s closeness to Henry. Like Cullen (and Marcella), fear of being replaced seems to be fuelling Yann\u2019s fire. Whoever the killer is they\u2019ve struck again, this time adding \u201cchild abduction\u201d to their rap sheet.

      "body": "<p>Things are getting complicated in Marcella land, with yet more characters and the grim subject of child abduction thrown into the mix. It\u2019s chaotic, convoluted and increasingly hard to follow, but I do have a sneaking admiration for the show for chucking everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.</p> <h2>Detective. Witness. Suspect</h2> <p>A good week for our titular crime-solver, who looks to finally be off the hook for Grace Gibson\u2019s murder, and managed to eke out an admission of guilt from her old adversary Peter Cullen. Cullen\u2019s confession came at the end of a lengthy interrogation scene in which Marcella used every last trick in the book \u2013 spraying herself in the perfume Cullen bought for Maddy, questioning his abilities in the bedroom and playing to his vanity by declaring him nothing more than a \u201cpiss-pot copycat killer\u201d. At that point, Cullen couldn\u2019t bear to be considered some ersatz Grove Park wannabe and confessed to all the original murders. That he did so without a lawyer present doesn\u2019t seem to have been a problem for anyone involved, least of all the show\u2019s writers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e0544dff1a6520262755c57e91887a0811b9d33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e0544dff1a6520262755c57e91887a0811b9d33/0_113_3362_2017/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not just some \u2018piss-pot copycat killer\u2019 \u2026 Peter Cullen admits to the original Grove Park murders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not just some \u2018piss-pot copycat killer\u2019 \u2026 Peter Cullen admits to the original Grove Park murders.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amanda Searle/ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cullen managed to get a few decent jabs in himself, twigging that Marcella had separated from Jason and highlighting the shared fear he and Marcella have in being \u201creplaced\u201d by their partners. The old \u201c<a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent\">we\u2019re not so different, you and I</a>\u201d trope has been done to death in detective dramas, but this was an effective spin on it, mainly because we know that Marcella, like Cullen, is capable of acts of violence. There was some nice tense back and forths between the pair, with Cullen trying to goad Marcella into a moment of rage by mentioning \u201clittle Juliette\u201d, whose birthday it is. Just what happened to her 11 years ago, and why does Cullen seem to know the ins and outs of it?</p> <p>Marcella\u2019s second big victory of the week came when she managed to link the Grove Park killer \u2013 or rather the copycat \u2013 to Grace Gibson\u2019s death, effectively absolving herself. It was rather fortunate that Cara\u2019s friend Leah was wearing the same drug-filled necklace the killer took as a trophy from Grace, and managed to get arrested, putting her in direct contact with the police, but hey, I\u2019m sure Marcella will take it. She probably shouldn\u2019t put up the \u201cI\u2019m not guilty\u201d bunting just yet \u2013 there\u2019s still the testimony to come of Mo, the cab driver working illegally for Hassan. Hassan was murdered this week by an unknown assailant, after revealing to Marcella that Mo had seen a woman carrying a heavy object out of Gibson\u2019s flat. The team are already on Mo\u2019s trail \u2013 I have a feeling that he might point the finger of blame at Marcella when they do track him down.</p> <h2>Also under suspicion</h2> <p>While Cullen has taken the rap for those original killings, there\u2019s still the more recent crimes left to solve, most notably the attack on the old man last week. The hotel keycard dropped during that botched effort links to Bendik, but while he\u2019s definitely a wrong\u2019un, CCTV footage shows that a hooded figure nabbed his keycard after he handed it back in. Who could that hooded figure be? Well, bizarrely there\u2019s a chance it\u2019s Matthew, Henry\u2019s mate and head of the IT firm that set up the computer used by the person who threatened Cara shortly before she died. (I did say it was convoluted!)</p> <p>Matthew doesn\u2019t look the type to threaten webcam girls and stick plastic bags over people\u2019s heads, but what about his boyfriend Yann? I\u2019m guessing he could get access to the computer through Matthew, and he\u2019s certainly exhibiting enough telling weirdo traits. His surprise for Matthew, an exact recreation of their first meal together, came off as more creepy than caring, especially when he decided to interrupt their date with a tirade about Matthew\u2019s closeness to Henry. Like Cullen (and Marcella), fear of being replaced seems to be fuelling Yann\u2019s fire.</p> <p>Whoever the killer is they\u2019ve struck again, this time adding \u201cchild abduction\u201d to their rap sheet. Six-year-old May has been taken, after the killer murdered her babysitter in the standard fashion. Thankfully they didn\u2019t do the same to May \u2013 probably a bit much for primetime TV \u2013 but why they didn\u2019t is an interesting question.

Later on 27 April: In Michigan, a three-year-old boy found a gun in his father\u2019s drawer and shot himself in the arm. He is expected to survive. Gladwin County\u2019s prosecutor is reviewing possible charges. The pace of such shootings is increasing. Last year, the Washington Post analyzed shootings by small children and found that by this time of year there had been 18. So far this year, there have been 23. The statistics are worse for children who are not the shooters, but who are the victims of shootings accidental or otherwise. Among children in general, aged 11 or under, the figures are startling: at least 170 have been killed or injured this year in the US. Beyond the raw statistics, it\u2019s difficult to sort out why the numbers are climbing, because the data is not being authoritatively compiled. The US Centers for Disease Control once recorded information about the circumstances around such shootings, but has since stopped under funding pressure from Congress. Last month, more than 100 medical groups sent a letter asking Congress to resume funding the CDC\u2019s research on gun violence. The letter said research could lead to saved lives, as it has with sudden infant death syndrome and rear-facing infant car seats. Lack of funding, the scientists wrote, has \u201ccaused a dramatic chilling effect on federal research that has stalled and stymied progress on gathering critical data to inform prevention of gun violence\u201d.",

Amid the glamour of the Met Gala it is easy to forget that \u201cfashion\u2019s Oscars\u201d are held to celebrate the opening of the latest exhibition from the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute. This year, that exhibition is Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology, which brings some of the world\u2019s most cutting-edge fashion together to examine the relationship between couture and technology, the hand-created and the machine-made. Featuring more than 170 examples of haute couture and avant-garde ready-to-wear, dating from the early 1900s to the present, the Costume Institute\u2019s curator Andrew Bolton says he set out to finally provide an answer for a debate that has simmered for decades \u2013 is fashion art? \u201cI\u2019m tired of it,\u201d Bolton said of the debate. \u201cArt critics sometimes find it hard to accept that fashion is art because there\u2019s a functionality to it. We have to ask different questions of fashion \u2013 is it relevant, is it significant, does it have meaning, quality. It\u2019s undeniably art.\u201d Among the designers on display are Yves Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen, Madame Gr\u00e8s and Iris van Herpen \u2013 the Dutch fashion couturier who, in 2010, became the first person to include a 3D-printed haute couture garment in their catwalk show. Van Herpen\u2019s designs \u2013 which look more like wearable sculptures \u2013 are at the forefront of fashion technology, combining traditional hand crafting with cutting-edge techniques such as 3D printing, laser cutting and digital knitting. The Robert Lehman Wing galleries, on the museum\u2019s first floor and ground level, have been transformed into a building-within-a-building using white scrims. Embroidery and feather work are showcased on the upper floor of the exhibition, while pleating, lacework and leatherwork occupy the lower galleries. One exhibit, an intricate wedding dress by Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel. Lagerfeld\u2019s hand-drawn design was \u201ctransferred onto a computer to make a pixilated Baroque pattern, rhinestones were heat transferred by machine, outlined by hand with gold paint and finished with pearls and gemstones,\u201d making it \u201cthe perfect case study\u201d, Bolton said. The exhibition \u2013 one of a few currently showing across the US to examine the meeting of tech and textiles \u2013 is held against the backdrop of an important moment for the industry, where disposable fashion dominates. \u201cSometimes the artistry of fashion is completely lost in a world that is obsessed by fast fashion, consumerism, celebrity disposable fashion,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cThat was one of the ideas. And I wanted to show how the proximity to pr\u00e9t-\u00e2-porter and haute couture is diminishing.\u201d Jonathan Ive, chief design officer for Apple \u2013 the gala and exhibition\u2019s primary sponsor \u2013 said he believes \u201cone can only understand a material with your hands that you can come to understand its true nature,\u201d but that he hoped the exhibit will challenge the preconception that \u201cthe former is somehow inherently more valuable than the latter.\u201d Tonight\u2019s partygoers are unlikely to be bogged down in such conceptualities at the \u201cultimate global celebrity/power cocktail\u201d, as it has been dubbed by the New York Times, where all eyes are will be on the outfits of America\u2019s celebrity royalty \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9, Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian. Ive is one of the Met Gala\u2019s co-hosts, along with pop star Swift, designer Miuccia Prada, and the event\u2019s annual host, editor-in-chief of American Vogue Anna Wintour. The event\u2019s honorary chairs are Lagerfeld, Miuccia Prada and Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re, Louis Vuitton\u2019s artistic director. Started by publicist Eleanor Lambert in 1948 as a philanthropic ball for New York socialites, Wintour\u2019s turn as chairwoman has seen the event\u2019s profile skyrocket. At $30,000 a ticket for the estimated 600 attendees, it is expected to raise $12m for the Costume Institute. Lagerfeld\u2019s wedding dress, like many exquisite couture creations in the exhibition and those to be showcased at the ball, were only made to be worn once. There\u2019s no second run for this kind of perfectionism. It had better be a good party.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The White House has faced tough questioning over comedian Larry Wilmore\u2019s use of a taboo racial slur at its annual correspondents dinner. Press secretary Josh Earnest was challenged repeatedly by April Ryan, an African American journalist and author of The Presidency in Black and White, who suggested that many people in the room were \u201cappalled\u201d by the N-word being uttered to the president\u2019s face. Earnest said that Barack Obama appreciated \u201cthe spirit\u201d of Wilmore\u2019s remark. Wilmore, who is African American, ended his after-dinner speech on Saturday by recognising the historical significance of America\u2019s first black president, pounding his chest and telling Obama: \u201cWords alone do me no justice. So, Mr President, if I\u2019m going to keep it 100: yo, Barry, you did it, my nigga.\u201d The comment immediately divided people both in the room and beyond. Jonathan Capehart of the Washington Post blogged: \u201cNever before has the n-word been used to address the president. At least, not in public and most definitely not to his face. That\u2019s why Wilmore\u2019s use of it was as shocking as it was disrespectful.\u201d At Monday\u2019s daily press briefing at the White House, the issue was raised by Ryan, Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks. She described it as \u201ca word that is one of the worst words, many people say, you could say to anyone\u201d. Earnest did not address this directly but noted that following Obama\u2019s act at the annual dinner is \u201cone of the most difficult tasks in comedy\u201d, since the president has shown himself \u201cadept\u201d at delivering one-liners and so expects comedians to go \u201cright up to the line\u201d. But Ryan pressed further: \u201cMany African Americans in that room \u2013 who included civil rights leaders, black comedians \u2013 were very appalled. ... Black Republicans were upset, black Democrats were upset. People felt that not just throwing it at him, he threw it at them, and also, it diminished the office of the presidency and it diminished him. Did he cross the line?\u201d Earnest responded: \u201cApril, what I would say is it\u2019s not the first time that people on the Monday after the White House correspondents dinner have observed that the comedian on Saturday night crossed the line.\u201d He cited the examples of Stephen Colbert, who in 2006 memorably roasted George W Bush, and Wanda Sykes, who in 2009 joked about the 11 September terrorist attacks. \u201cSo it\u2019s not the first time that we\u2019ve had a conversation like this in which these of kinds of concerns have been raised or expressed. \u201cLook, I had an opportunity to speak to the president about this briefly this morning and he said that he appreciated the spirit of the sentiments that Mr Wilmore expressed.\u201d Reflecting on Wilmore\u2019s routine, which also targeted some journalists and left them stony-faced, Earnest added: \u201cHe ended his speech by saying that he couldn\u2019t put into words the pride that he felt in this president and he made the observation that our country has made remarkable progress just in his lifetime from not being willing to accept an African American quarterback to electing and re-electing an African American not just to lead the United States but to lead the free world. \u201cAgain, I take Mr Wilmore at his words that he found that to be a powerful transformation just in his lifetime and something that he seemed to be pretty obviously proud of.\u201d But Ryan wondered if Wilmore\u2019s use of \u201cfree speech\u201d gave the president\u2019s detractors fodder to use it against him. Earnest said he had no idea and would not spend much time worrying about it. Ryan then made reference to a podcast interview that Obama gave last June in which he himself used the slur to argue that, despite great progress, racism is still pervasive in America. The president said at the time: \u201cIt\u2019s not just a matter of it not being polite to say \u2018nigger\u2019 in public. That\u2019s not the measure of whether racism still exists or not.\u201d Wilmore, by contrast, used it for the president \u201csomewhat as the butt of a joke\u201d, Ryan contended. \u201cYou were in that room as well as I was,\u201d she told Earnest. \u201cThere was an eerie, awkward silence and quietness. People didn\u2019t know how to handle that.\u201d The press secretary countered: \u201cI\u2019m confident that Mr Wilmore used the word by design \u2013 he was seeking to be provocative \u2013 but I think any reading of his comments makes clear he was not using the president as the butt of a joke. \u201cWhat is true is that this is a tough assignment that any comedian takes on when they sign up for this job and the president\u2019s expectation when he walks in that room is that that comedian and other people are going to get much closer to the line than they ordinarily would as they try to make a joke.\u201d Ryan noted other problematic terms that littered Wilmore\u2019s routine. \u201cI just want to be very clear,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the president is OK with his use and how he used the N-word, \u2018jigaboo\u2019, \u2018negro nation\u2019 and \u2018thug\u2019?\u201d Earnest\u2019s response referred back to the president saying he appreciated \u201cthe spirit\u201d of Wilmore\u2019s expressions on Saturday night. Later, he said the White House did not see or vet Wilmore\u2019s remarks before they were delivered but he felt they came from \u201ca genuine place\u201d.",

Did he cross the line?\u201d</p> <p>Earnest responded: \u201cApril, what I would say is it\u2019s not the first time that people on the Monday after the White House correspondents dinner have observed that the comedian on Saturday night crossed the line.\u201d </p> <p>He cited the examples of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X93u3anTco\">Stephen Colbert</a>, who in 2006 memorably roasted George W Bush, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmyRog2w4DI\">Wanda Sykes</a>, who in 2009 joked about the 11 September terrorist attacks. \u201cSo it\u2019s not the first time that we\u2019ve had a conversation like this in which these of kinds of concerns have been raised or expressed.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I had an opportunity to speak to the president about this briefly this morning and he said that he appreciated the spirit of the sentiments that Mr Wilmore expressed.\u201d</p> <p>Reflecting on Wilmore\u2019s routine, which also targeted some journalists and left them stony-faced, Earnest added: \u201cHe ended his speech by saying that he couldn\u2019t put into words the pride that he felt in this president and he made the observation that our country has made remarkable progress just in his lifetime from not being willing to accept an African American quarterback to electing and re-electing an African American not just to lead the United States but to lead the free world.</p> <p>\u201cAgain, I take Mr Wilmore at his words that he found that to be a powerful transformation just in his lifetime and something that he seemed to be pretty obviously proud of.\u201d<br /></p> <p>But Ryan wondered if Wilmore\u2019s use of \u201cfree speech\u201d gave the president\u2019s detractors fodder to use it against him. Earnest said he had no idea and would not spend much time worrying about it.</p> <p>Ryan then made reference to a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/22/barack-obama-n-word-racism-marc-maron-interview\">podcast interview that Obama gave last June</a> in which he himself used the slur to argue that, despite great progress, racism is still pervasive in America. The president said at the time: \u201cIt\u2019s not just a matter of it not being polite to say \u2018nigger\u2019 in public. That\u2019s not the measure of whether racism still exists or not.\u201d</p> <p>Wilmore, by contrast, used it for the president \u201csomewhat as the butt of a joke\u201d, Ryan contended. \u201cYou were in that room as well as I was,\u201d she told Earnest. \u201cThere was an eerie, awkward silence and quietness. People didn\u2019t know how to handle that.\u201d</p> <p>The press secretary countered: \u201cI\u2019m confident that Mr Wilmore used the word by design \u2013 he was seeking to be provocative \u2013 but I think any reading of his comments makes clear he was not using the president as the butt of a joke.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is true is that this is a tough assignment that any comedian takes on when they sign up for this job and the president\u2019s expectation when he walks in that room is that that comedian and other people are going to get much closer to the line than they ordinarily would as they try to make a joke.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan noted other problematic terms that littered Wilmore\u2019s routine. \u201cI just want to be very clear,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the president is OK with his use and how he used the N-word, \u2018jigaboo\u2019, \u2018negro nation\u2019 and \u2018thug\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>Earnest\u2019s response referred back to the president saying he appreciated \u201cthe spirit\u201d of Wilmore\u2019s expressions on Saturday night. Later, he said the White House did not see or vet Wilmore\u2019s remarks before they were delivered but he felt they came from \u201ca genuine place\u201d.</p>",

The European Broadcasting Union said that it had reached a deal with Logo, a cable network best known for LGBT-themed programming that is part of Viacom group. Only the final round of the contest, which will air on 14 May, will be broadcast in the US. \u201cWe are thrilled that the world\u2019s biggest entertainment show is being broadcast live in one of the biggest TV markets for the very first time,\u201d Jon Ola Sand, executive supervisor of the contest, said in a statement. \u201cThe Eurovision Song Contest is now a truly global phenomenon and we are extremely happy that US viewers now get to join those all over Europe, Australia and Asia in experiencing the Grand Final of world\u2019s longest running annual TV music competition on 14 May.\u201d The broadcast will also be streamed via the LogoTV app and website. According to the statement, nearly 50m US homes have access to Logo. Last year, Sweden\u2019s Man Zelmerlow won the grand final. As tradition demands, Zelmerlow will host this year\u2019s semifinals and final competition, which will be held in Stockholm, Sweden. The contest is currently in its 61st year. This year\u2019s theme is \u201cCome Together\u201d. In 2015, 197 million people tuned in to watch the final round. About 44.8% of them were 15 to 24 years old. Last year\u2019s contest was hosted by Eurovision\u2019s 2014 winner, Conchita Wurst, Austrian artist and drag queen. Since her victory in 2014, Wurst has become an icon and a spokesperson for an LGBT community. \u201cIt\u2019s just unbelievable that nearly every gay human being knows who I am now \u2013 that\u2019s overwhelming,\u201d she told the Guardian after her win. According to EBU, the most successful Eurovision song contest winner was the Swedish pop band Abba, which won in 1974.",

      "bodyText": "A Silicon Valley tech CEO has sparked backlash for comments slamming local fruit vendors, saying he would \u201cmake their life miserable\u201d and \u201cdestroy\u201d their produce if they were stationed near his house \u2013 making him the latest wealthy Californian entrepreneur to publicly rail against low-income people. Mark Woodward, CEO of software company Invoca, published \u2013 and later deleted \u2013 a Facebook post saying that he would have no qualms about aggressively harassing unauthorized fruit sellers in his neighborhood if they got near his home. I would go out there and make their life miserable. I would do whatever it took to make them leave. If that meant destroying some of their produce, or standing out there with signs to chase everyone away, Or just making them very uncomfortable, I would do that in a heartbeat.\u201d The comments were published on a public San Jose real estate page called Willow Glen Charm in response to an anonymous post complaining about fruit sellers. They mark only the latest example of a male tech CEO making aggressive, insensitive and tone-deaf remarks about people less fortunate than them. Asked for comment on Monday, Woodward declined to apologize. \u201cThere were some other incidents leading up to this that led to my emotional reaction,\u201d he said in a statement, sent by a spokeswoman. \u201cI removed the statements because I realized bringing a nuanced conversation to a social forum where it could be taken out of context was not the best way to bring resolution to a serious, multi-faceted issue.\u201d Woodward\u2019s comments come at as time when experts have increasingly raised concerns about the way tech firms have exacerbated income inequality, with low-income workers and people of color increasingly struggling to make ends meet in the northern California communities that are home to some of the wealthiest companies in the world. In February, tech entrepreneur and startup founder Justin Keller wrote an open letter to the mayor and police chief of San Francisco, complaining that \u201cwealthy working people have earned their right to live in the city\u201d without passing by homeless people on a regular basis. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to see the pain, struggle, and despair of homeless people to and from my way to work,\u201d he wrote. In 2015, startup CEO Greg Gopman landed in hot water after he ranted about the homeless, calling them \u201cthe lower part of society\u201d, a \u201cburden and liability\u201d and \u201cdegenerates\u201d who \u201cgather like hyenas\u201d. Startup founder Peter Shih was forced to delete a Medium post he wrote in 2013 called 10 Things I Hate About You: San Francisco Edition, in which he complained about San Francisco having \u201csome of the craziest homeless people\u201d who don\u2019t deserve money. In the wake of immediate firestorms and ensuing PR disasters, Keller, Gopman and Shih all apologized for their remarks. The San Francisco Examiner first reported on the Facebook screed, noting that, before he deleted his comments, Woodward defended his stance in response to critical neighbors, writing: \u201cI had a family, not from our neighborhood who was constantly digging through the recycle bins in our neighborhood illegally. I confronted them rather aggressively and they have never been back.\u201d Woodward recently noted on his LinkedIn page that Invoca has raised $30m. The company, which specializes in marketing and phone data, advertises its leadership team as the \u201cbig brains and small egos creating amazing technology\u201d. The original commenter on the Facebook thread called the fruit vendors \u201ccomplete strangers\u201d, complaining that they were \u201cwatching our homes, knowing what time we leave for work, what time our kids leave for school and what packages arrive from FedEx or UPS\u201d. Other commenters on the Facebook page expressed outrage at those criticizing the fruit sellers, noting that many of them were Latino residents who cause no disturbances and \u201cstruggle every day to make ends meet\u201d.

Following the announcement on Thursday, only Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stands between us and a vote. You might wonder why I care, why I am out advocating for this issue so passionately. I filmed dozens of episodes of Orange is the New Black without understanding the depth of the issues in our criminal justice system. I\u2019m grateful that the show played a pivotal role in introducing me to the change that was needed. I am a white man who grew up in a family with financial security. Because of that, I\u2019ve had the great fortune of never having to worry about our broken criminal justice system. My community, a white community, has not been affected by police and courts in the ways many communities of color have. Put simply, I didn\u2019t pay attention to the issue of criminal justice because it didn\u2019t pay attention to me. But then I started reading Michelle Alexander\u2019s incredible book The New Jim Crow, followed by Shaka Sengor\u2019s memoir Writing My Wrongs. I studied, I learned and I realized I couldn\u2019t afford to sit on the sidelines while the cycle of mass incarceration continued to rob so many people of their lives, so many communities of their most talented friends and family. One in three black men born today can expect to spend time in prison during their lifetime, if current trends continue. Black people are imprisoned at six times the rate of white people. Of the 2.3 million people behind bars today in America, 60% are people of color. And we aren\u2019t talking about violent crimes here \u2013 we are talking about drugs. While white people use and sell drugs at roughly the same rates as black, Latino and Native Americans, people of color are stopped by police, searched, arrested, prosecuted, convicted and incarcerated at higher rates than white people for drug crimes, according to the Drug Policy Institute. The disparities span every step in the criminal justice system, from police to prison. And while these statistics are startling, it\u2019s the personal stories that are even more heart-wrenching. On Thursday, I was on Capitol Hill with a man named Alton Mills. Alton was sentenced to life in prison at just 25 years old for a nonviolent drug offense. Recently granted clemency by Barack Obama after more than 20 years behind bars, he joined me in advocating for change. His daughter was just 19 months old when he went to prison, and she is now graduating nursing school. She was forced to grow up without him. The most unique part of his story, unfortunately, is that as an African American man in the criminal justice system, he got out. The US currently incarcerates more people than any other nation in the world. We have 5% of the world\u2019s population, and 25% of the world\u2019s prisoners. We can change this. We can stop wasting the incredible talent of millions of Americans behind bars. While in Washington DC and with Congress, I have heard a lot of talk about how America leads the world. This is one area where we don\u2019t want to. That\u2019s why Mitch McConnell has to allow this bill to get a vote. We have more than 30 bipartisan cosponsors. We have momentum. Now we need his.

      "bodyText": "A red Ferrari with the top down swerved past on the winding dirt road, heading to what looked like a small Mars encampment. Helicopters landed on the side of the road and greeters darted across. At a farmers\u2019 market with overflowing baskets full of raspberries, watermelons, and focaccia, I asked for a mango, and the farmer started cutting it in half for me: \u201cThat\u2019ll be $7.\u201d This weekend, outside Las Vegas, a group of Burning Man veterans put on a festival called Further Future, now in its second year. Across 49 acres of Native American land over three days, with around 5,000 attendees, the event was the epitome of a new trend of so-called \u201ctransformational festivals\u201d that are drawing technologists for what\u2019s billed as a mix of fun and education. While tickets started at $350, many attendees opted for upgrades to fully staffed accommodation and fine dining. While Burning Man\u2019s hidden luxury camps on the edge of town are criticized by old time Burners who value labor on the desert, Further Future is a splinter group that\u2019s unapologetic about wanting a good, hard-labor-free time. \u201cUnabashed luxury,\u201d the website reads, in reference to its Lunar Palace accommodation. Burners are judged for using Wi-Fi or having private chefs; Further Future advertises its connectivity and personal festival assistant service. Nobu hosted a $250-a-seat dinner on the first night of the festival. Partiers included Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet; Clear Channel CEO Bob Pittman; and top Facebook executive Stan Chudnovsky. \u201cIt\u2019s the Burning Man 1%,\u201d said Charles, a documentary filmmaker with spikes pierced through his ears and a brainwave meditation startup. \u201cIt\u2019s curated.\u201d Eric Schmidt was backstage leaning against a tower of pallets and wearing an ornate top hat and a vest made of mirrors. He said he was at Further Future mostly because these were his friends. \u201cIt\u2019s well documented that I go to Burning Man. The future\u2019s driven by people with an alternative world view. You never know where you\u2019ll find ideas. \u201d This was the cream of the Burning Man crop, he said. \u201cThis is a high percentage of San Francisco entrepreneurs, and they tend to be winners. It\u2019s a curated, self-selected group of adults who have jobs,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cYou can tell by the percentage of trailers.\u201d Did they provide the costume for him? \u201cMy own, of course. What do you think of it?\u201d he pressed the glass panels and smiled. Party planners at Burning Man are careful to hide their luxury dwellings behind large walls dressed as art projects, but Further Future had no such pretension. Behind a chain-link fence was the VIP neighborhood with airstreams ($5,000) and Lunar Palaces ($7,500) \u2013 200 sq ft, 9ft high, custom-made luxury domes with wooden flooring and furnished to sleep four. These included something called an entourage concierge \u2013 \u201ca personal, dedicated lifestyle manager and assistant ready to help you with any requirements or desires you may have. No request is ever unattainable.\u201d The lifestyle assistant, who makes sure you have the soap you like, will work with you on everything \u201cfrom the green juice you enjoy every morning to the old-fashioned cocktail you sip on in the evenings\u201d. In a shipping container converted to control room, I found Russell Ward, the general show runner and publicist who\u2019s the mastermind behind the most popular \u201ctransformational festivals\u201d. \u201cThis is top-league networking and business folks are all here in the guise of having fun. It\u2019s designed around the music, but it\u2019s about the business,\u201d Ward said. \u201cA ton of business will get done here. Entrepreneurs will get funded, investors will find their trajectories, service companies will meet and mix it up.\u201d Before running the tech world\u2019s hot new trend, Ward had an online gaming hedge fund. \u201cThe problem was it got hairy. It\u2019s a dodgy industry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t doing anything illegal, but we got raided by the government, and I got spooked. So I had to decide where to plant my next seed, and I found this knack for festivals.\u201d The aesthetic of the festival was \u201csteampunk futurism\u201d (latex underwear, fur coats, platform boots, metal headpieces). Ward was wearing a Hawaiian tank top, clear Gucci sunglasses, and a silver-coated bobcat claw on a chain. \u201cBurning Man, and we have great reverence for Burning Man, but there\u2019s always an element of arduousness. Here, we have spa treatments and green juice,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s already enough in life that\u2019s tough.\u201d Further Future is only one of several \u201ctransformations\u201d Ward runs, and they all overlap somewhat, especially MaiTai, the billionaire kiteboarding community centered around Virgin founder Richard Branson\u2019s island. \u201cKiteboarding is the new golf,\u201d Ward said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s doing it. Branson, Elon, Sergey.\u201d Justin Shaffer, an early Facebook employee and now an investor, says he wants Further Future to answer a new set of questions: \u201cWhat happens post-capitalism? Even post-democracy? What about post-employment, when we have universal basic income? \u201cPhysical proximity will become more important in a world where the first time you see the pyramids is in VR.\u201d In the Wellness Tent, there\u2019s a fitness class with people jumping up and down in unison. Nearby, one woman advertises psychological services as \u201ctools and technology broken down for busy professionals\u201d. Another advertises \u201csmudging aura cleansing\u201d. To the side of the main wellness stage, a man is getting a transfusion in his arm from a bright yellow bag of fluid (a liter of saline and vitamins called Push IV). The patient reclines, half asleep, until someone accidentally knocks the bag over, jolting the needle in his arm. An espresso line stretches 45 minutes long for lavender lattes. During a wellness panel on \u201cAdventure Travel: Journey As Wellness\u201d, someone asks the instructor Fabian Piorkowski about privilege. \u201cWe\u2019re so privileged to come to these spiritual places \u2013 Further Future, Tulum \u2013 but not everyone can,\u201d the audience member says, asking Piorkowski how he should reconcile that. \u201cIt\u2019s all about balance. We are the ones meant to be the air, not the earth,\u201d Piorkowski said. \u201cSo you have this group who can travel. The purpose can never be to enable everyone to travel because that would create imbalance.\u201d On stage, entrepreneur Lo\u00efc Le Meur is wearing a whole fox as a headpiece and interviewing Schmidt, who answers questions about blockchain (he\u2019s for it), eugenics (he\u2019s opposed), and cellphones (he\u2019s worried about addiction). Schmidt is beloved. The woman behind me shouts that he should run for president. Someone else says: \u201cMarry me, Eric.\u201d It was his birthday just a couple of days before, and everyone sings Happy Birthday. At dinner that night, everyone gets a slice of birthday cake. Schmidt sat on the floor, smiling, his eyes almost closed. The dinner party included a beer tasting, and the bartender was frustrated because the foie gras torchon was too fatty for a proper beer pairing. Schmidt and his pack headed out into the night. Robert Scott, the 42-year-old cofounder of the festival, said you don\u2019t need to sweat to have an epiphany. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ways to find an epiphany. Being in the desert under hard conditions is one way to bring yourself into a receptive state, I suppose, but here, all these things are putting you in the same place gently,\u201d he said. We sat at a table after a rainstorm, his shaggy brown hair disheveled. \u201cIt\u2019s important what we do here,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we keep saying. We\u2019re shaping the future. These are the people who not only can do it, but these are the only people who can.\u201d This article was amended on 24 May 2016 to clarify that the \u2018unabashed luxury\u2019 of the Burning Man camps advertised on Further Future\u2019s website referred to the Lunar Palace accommodation.",

At a farmers\u2019 market with overflowing baskets full of raspberries, watermelons, and focaccia, I asked for a mango, and the farmer started cutting it in half for me: \u201cThat\u2019ll be $7.\u201d</p> <p>This weekend, outside Las Vegas, a group of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/burning-man-festival\">Burning Man </a>veterans put on a festival called Further Future, now in its second year. Across 49 acres of Native American land over three days, with around 5,000 attendees, the event was the epitome of a new trend of so-called \u201ctransformational festivals\u201d that are drawing technologists for what\u2019s billed as a mix of fun and education. While tickets started at $350, many attendees opted for upgrades to fully staffed accommodation and fine dining.</p> <p>While Burning Man\u2019s hidden luxury camps on the edge of town are criticized by old time Burners who value labor on the desert, Further Future is a splinter group that\u2019s unapologetic about wanting a good, hard-labor-free time. \u201cUnabashed luxury,\u201d the website reads, in reference to its Lunar Palace accommodation. Burners are judged for using Wi-Fi or having private chefs; Further Future advertises its connectivity and personal festival assistant service. Nobu hosted a $250-a-seat dinner on the first night of the festival. Partiers included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/eric-schmidt\">Eric Schmidt</a>, executive chairman of Alphabet; Clear Channel CEO Bob Pittman; and top Facebook executive Stan Chudnovsky.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>This is a high percentage of San Francisco entrepreneurs, and they tend to be winners</p> <footer> <cite>Eric Schmidt, Alphabet executive chairman</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d223973af9748d650b0a26a36fb1f44a19a5a91d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d223973af9748d650b0a26a36fb1f44a19a5a91d/165_0_3503_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Further Future festival: \u2018We\u2019re shaping the future.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Further Future festival: \u2018We\u2019re shaping the future.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tomas Loewy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Burning Man 1%,\u201d said Charles, a documentary filmmaker with spikes pierced through his ears and a brainwave meditation startup. \u201cIt\u2019s curated.\u201d</p> <p>Eric Schmidt was backstage leaning against a tower of pallets and wearing an ornate top hat and a vest made of mirrors. He said he was at Further Future mostly because these were his friends.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s well documented that I go to Burning Man. The future\u2019s driven by people with an alternative world view. You never know where you\u2019ll find ideas. \u201d</p> <p>This was the cream of the Burning Man crop, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a high percentage of San Francisco entrepreneurs, and they tend to be winners. It\u2019s a curated, self-selected group of adults who have jobs,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cYou can tell by the percentage of trailers.\u201d</p> <p>Did they provide the costume for him?</p> <p>\u201cMy own, of course.

Behind a chain-link fence was the VIP neighborhood with airstreams ($5,000) and Lunar Palaces ($7,500) \u2013 200 sq ft, 9ft high, custom-made luxury domes with wooden flooring and furnished to sleep four. These included something called an entourage concierge \u2013 \u201ca personal, dedicated lifestyle manager and assistant ready to help you with any requirements or desires you may have. No request is ever unattainable.\u201d The lifestyle assistant, who makes sure you have the soap you like, will work with you on everything \u201cfrom the green juice you enjoy every morning to the old-fashioned cocktail you sip on in the evenings\u201d. </p> <p> </p> <p>In a shipping container converted to control room, I found Russell Ward, the general show runner and publicist who\u2019s the mastermind behind the most popular \u201ctransformational festivals\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is top-league networking and business folks are all here in the guise of having fun. It\u2019s designed around the music, but it\u2019s about the business,\u201d Ward said. \u201cA ton of business will get done here. Entrepreneurs will get funded, investors will find their trajectories, service companies will meet and mix it up.\u201d</p> <p>Before running the tech world\u2019s hot new trend, Ward had an online gaming hedge fund. \u201cThe problem was it got hairy. It\u2019s a dodgy industry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t doing anything illegal, but we got raided by the government, and I got spooked. So I had to decide where to plant my next seed, and I found this knack for festivals.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s designed around music, but it\u2019s about business ...

To the side of the main wellness stage, a man is getting a transfusion in his arm from a bright yellow bag of fluid (a liter of saline and vitamins called Push IV).

The purpose can never be to enable everyone to travel because that would create imbalance.\u201d</p> <p>On stage, entrepreneur Lo\u00efc Le Meur is wearing a whole fox as a headpiece and interviewing Schmidt, who answers questions about blockchain (he\u2019s for it), eugenics (he\u2019s opposed), and cellphones (he\u2019s worried about addiction). Schmidt is beloved.</p> <p>The woman behind me shouts that he should run for president.

The Clarets secured a top-two finish in the Championship with a 1-0 victory against Queens Park Rangers, courtesy of Sam Vokes\u2019s brilliant second-half header. That took their unbeaten run to 22 matches, confirming their return to the top flight at the first opportunity and a bumper pay day as broadcast rights soar for the 2016\u201117 campaign. While Dyche was content for his players to mark the occasion in style, he planned to recreate his modest celebration from the previous promotion campaign. \u201cIt feels fantastic. It\u2019s marvellous. But I\u2019ll be in the car later, driving down the M6 with my kids and my wife,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll probably grab a coffee at McDonald\u2019s like I normally do. Two years ago people were staring at me like \u2018is he really in here getting a coffee?\u2019, but I am normal, I do have a life, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing. \u201cThe lads will get a couple of days off, no mistake, and if they have a couple of drams they deserve it. But come Thursday, or Wednesday, they\u2019ll be ready to train. We\u2019ve got a chance to win the title now and we must be ready to take it.\u201d There were joyous celebrations at Turf Moor, with fans pouring on to the pitch while Dyche and his charges took in the moment with their families. But the manager was eager to stress that promotion was only one part of the season\u2019s aims. Having finished second to Leicester City in 2013\u201114, his eyes are firmly on lifting the Championship trophy. \u201cWe\u2019ll be focused on Saturday [against Charlton] I can assure you. We were runners-up last time don\u2019t forget. So we want to win it. That will be the focus. We\u2019ll go and win it, that\u2019s our job. Let\u2019s enjoy it now because this is another part of history for this club and history runs deep here.\u201d Brighton, meanwhile, will have to wait until Saturday for their chance of promotion after fluffing their lines against Derby County. The Seagulls drew 1-1, after James Wilson scored a scrappy 95th-minute equaliser for Brighton, who also had Lewis Dunk sent off after Andreas Weimann had put Derby in front. They must now beat Middlesbrough on Saturday to seal their place in the Premier League. \u201cIt becomes clear [needing to win],\u201d Chris Hughton, the Brighton manager, said. \u201cSometimes when you go into a game knowing a draw will do, a drawing mentality turns into a drawing mentality. We know what we have to do. We just have to show enough quality, against a really good team. There\u2019s no doubt they\u2019re favourites, and they\u2019ll be pleased with the result today, but we\u2019ll give ourselves every chance.\u201d Wilson\u2019s scruffy strike, through a goalmouth scramble, gave Brighton a point, and extended their unbeaten run to 13, something the forward himself believes is important. He said: \u201cGoing into the last game on a defeat is probably the worst way to do it. We have got a point so we\u2019re going up to Middlesbrough with some confidence.\u201d Hughton added: \u201cI think it will give us something.

      "bodyText": "New studies suggest that the weather in far off Greenland, one of the fastest warming parts of the Earth, is affecting the rainfall patterns in Britain. This is linked to the extremely wet summers of 2007 and 2012. Sheffield University, checking data back to 1851, found that since the 1980s there has been an increase in the number of summer high pressure blocking systems that become anchored over this vast island ice sheet. The result has been to drag warm air over Greenland causing melting on a much-increased scale. This is bad news for sea level rise everywhere, but additionally for Britain, because it prevents storm systems from moving over Greenland and diverts them south across the Atlantic and across the UK. The warmer air carries more moisture, released when clouds rise over the land. Blocking highs also occur in December, which has a similarly destabilising effect on the climate. This happened this winter, moving warm air northwards over the Arctic, preventing sea ice forming as extensively as normal. Over time, this leads to less sea ice overall, speeding up Arctic warming. It is the temperature difference between the Arctic regions and the temperate Atlantic that drives the jet stream and brings constantly changing conditions to Britain. This wonderful variety of weather that has provided the nation with an ideal opening to any chitchat with strangers, and that does not appear likely to change any time soon. But just for now, it might be wise to leave blocking highs over Greenland and kinks in the jet stream out of the conversation until you know people better.",

      "body": "<p>New studies suggest that the weather in far off Greenland, one of the fastest warming parts of the Earth, is affecting the rainfall patterns in Britain. This is linked to the extremely wet summers of 2007 and 2012.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/nr/climate-change-arctic-extreme-weather-uk-study-1.571126\">Sheffield University, checking data back to 1851</a>, found that since the 1980s there has been an increase in the number of summer high pressure blocking systems that become anchored over this vast island ice sheet. The result has been to drag warm air over Greenland causing melting on a much-increased scale.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/13/greenland-sees-record-smashing-early-ice-sheet-melt-climate-change\">Greenland sees record-smashing early ice sheet melt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is bad news for sea level rise everywhere, but additionally for Britain, because it prevents storm systems from moving over Greenland and diverts them south across the Atlantic and across the UK. The warmer air carries more moisture, released when clouds rise over the land.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theweatherprediction.com/blocking/\">Blocking highs</a> also occur in December, which has a similarly destabilising effect on the climate. This happened this winter, moving warm air northwards over the Arctic, preventing sea ice forming as extensively as normal. Over time, this leads to less sea ice overall, speeding up Arctic warming.</p> <p>It is the temperature difference between the Arctic regions and the temperate Atlantic that drives the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jul/17/global-warming-causing-extreme-weather-jet-stream-waves\">jet stream</a> and brings constantly changing conditions to Britain. This wonderful variety of weather that has provided the nation with an ideal opening to any chitchat with strangers, and that does not appear likely to change any time soon. </p> <p>But just for now, it might be wise to leave blocking highs over Greenland and kinks in the jet stream out of the conversation until you know people better.</p> <p></p>",

      "bodyText": "Five years ago, the Turner prize-winning British artist Martin Creed had an idea \u2013 a secret handshake. It wasn\u2019t for just anyone; it was for his stepdaughter, who was 10 at the time. \u201cWe\u2019d go \u2018peace, love and understanding\u2019 with these hand signals when we were saying goodbye,\u201d says Creed over the phone from his home in London. He and his stepdaughter would make the peace sign together, where they each lifted one finger. They\u2019d make a love heart with the shape of their hands over their chests. And then, they\u2019d make a symbol for understanding by waving their hands, as if they were creating brainwaves between two people. Creed calls it \u201ca hippy thing\u201d, but it became a coping mechanism for stepfamily awkwardness. \u201cWhen I first got to know her, my relationship to her was not clear \u2013 am I her dad? Am I not her dad?\u201d he remembers. \u201cThis was a way to try and communicate with my stepdaughter, but without saying what it is, in a way.\u201d Now, Creed is taking the word \u201cunderstanding\u201d from his secret handshake and emblazoning it in enormous red letters along Brooklyn Bridge Park\u2019s Pier Six in New York City. Overlooking the East river, the 25ft-tall revolving neon sculpture simply says Understanding and is open for interpretation. Created with the Public Art Fund, which puts on major works for all in New York, it ties into Creed\u2019s first US retrospective, which opens at the Park Avenue Armory on 8 June. Originally meant to be a three-part work, the piece would have read Peace, Love and Understanding, but proved too expensive. Creed had to edit it down. \u201cI ended up thinking, \u2018Maybe all you need is understanding,\u2019\u201d the artist said. \u201cPeace and love can go out of the window a little bit, they\u2019re absolute ideals, but understanding is possible because it includes that what is not possible.\u201d The sculpture goes beyond his family experience to express his view on the wider political environment. \u201cI think it has to do with the bloody shit going on in the world at the moment,\u201d Creed says. \u201cIt has to do with wars and communicating with people in a way that\u2019s understanding, for lack of a better word.\u201d At the same time, Creed\u2019s sculpture is ultimately personal. \u201cI want to be understood,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what everybody wants. If we have an understanding of other people, or try to understand them and ourselves, it might help a bit.\u201d Creed has worked in a variety of media, from concepts (his work All the Bells, first performed in Costa Rica and then for the London Olympics, encourages the population of a certain place to ring a bell loudly for three minutes) to paintings. Born in West Yorkshire but brought up in Glasgow, hence his Scottish accent, he won the Turner in 2001. The installation he showed for the prize exhibition was Work No 227: The Lights Going On and Off \u2013 an empty room in which precisely that, and nothing else, happened. Neon signs are an ongoing series for the artist. Sometimes he\u2019s irked, other times he\u2019s inspired \u2013 his emotions filter through his glowing neon works. There are the more hopeful works, like Don\u2019t Worry in lemon yellow, and the blazing white phrase Everything is Going to Be Alright, which was hinged at the Hilton in New York\u2019s Times Square back in 2000. Then there are his more ill-tempered pieces, such as Fuck Off, Shit and Whatever, which tie into his punk roots, as Creed is also a musician who is releasing his next album on 8 July called Thoughts Lined Up. This piece, however, is both philosophical and playful. \u201cIt\u2019s a wee bit of a joke that you can stand under understanding,\u201d Creed says. The rotating sculpture is raised on a platform with stair-like seating to relax by the waterside. As picturesque as it is, the color red was chosen as a contrast to all the bright white lights that pepper the city skyline. \u201cNeon red is one of the most straightforward colors, it is the color of neon gas,\u201d Creed says. \u201cAnd yet, red is a danger color.\u201d Hinting as a warning for the danger the world is in, this is the third and largest of his rotating neon sign pieces after Work No 1357, Mothers from 2012 and Work No 2070, People from 2014. The artist sees this public sculpture as a way to get out of his own narcissism. \u201cI wanted something that looks to the street, rather than creating a wank world of my own,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m aware art galleries are closed off and people create their own fantasy worlds.\u201d The elite bubble of the art world may look attractive from the outside, but to this insider, that\u2019s what worries him. \u201cI worry about being deluded,\u201d Creed says. \u201cIn order to live your life without committing suicide you have to delude yourself that you are important, that what you do matters. To do things, you subscribe to a confidence-building delusion, which is dangerous to making work, as you can ignore the reality of life.\u201d Pausing, he chuckles, as if he has revealed too much. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he sighs. I can\u2019t help but remember his quirky, self-loathing neon signage, like Feelings, Coconuts and Opium. \u201cI\u2019m trying to look at the outside world and not trust my own interior world,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s possible, but I try.\u201d Aside from all this, do Creed and his stepdaughter still do their secret handshake? The artist laughs. \u201cWe don\u2019t do that any more,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s 15, so we just say goodbye now. I wouldn\u2019t try to do it because I\u2019d be scared she would give me the brush-off.\u201d Martin Creed\u2019s Understanding runs from 4 May to 23 October at Brooklyn Bridge Park\u2019s Pier 6, while his retrospective The Back Door at the Park Avenue Armory runs from 8 June to 7 August.",

They\u2019d make a love heart with the shape of their hands over their chests. And then, they\u2019d make a symbol for understanding by waving their hands, as if they were creating brainwaves between two people.</p> <p>Creed calls it \u201ca hippy thing\u201d, but it became a coping mechanism for stepfamily awkwardness. \u201cWhen I first got to know her, my relationship to her was not clear \u2013 am I her dad? Am I not her dad?\u201d he remembers. \u201cThis was a way to try and communicate with my stepdaughter, but without saying what it is, in a way.\u201d</p> <p>Now, Creed is taking the word \u201cunderstanding\u201d from his secret handshake and emblazoning it in enormous red letters along <a href=\"http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/park/pier-6\">Brooklyn Bridge Park\u2019s Pier Six</a> in New York City.

    "webTitle": "Labor policy could increase power prices by 8% to 25%, economist says",

      "bodyText": "A little-noticed part of Labor\u2019s climate policy could push up retail power prices by between 8% and 25%, economist Danny Price has claimed, with price hikes in Victoria exceeding the impact of the former Labor government\u2019s carbon tax. Price, who helped devise the Coalition\u2019s climate policy, told Guardian Australia last week the main plank of Labor\u2019s policy \u2013 a new style electricity emissions trading scheme \u2013 was exactly what he designed for Malcolm Turnbull in 2009 and mirrored what the Coalition\u2019s Direct Action plan would almost certainly have to become to meet Australia\u2019s greenhouse targets. He said the price rises under that scheme would be \u201cminimal\u201d for many years. But Price has now modelled a second plank of Labor\u2019s policy \u2013 a scheme under which big brown-coal generators, near the end of their operational life, would submit bids for how much money they would need to receive to shut straight away and deal with the community and employment fallout. The cost of the winning bid would be paid for by all the other generators in the market, who would enjoy higher prices because of their competitor\u2019s closure. The academics who first proposed the idea, Frank Jotzo and Salim Mazouz, estimated it could cause a one-off rise of between 1% and 2% in retail power bills, while recent modelling by analysis company Reputex found the impact could be even lower \u2013 between 0.2% and 1.3% \u2013 or that perhaps there would be no price rise at all. \u201cFor residential electricity bills, falling network costs may completely offset any cost impact of the new policy, with retail energy prices expected to fall out to 2020,\u201d said Bret Harper, associate director of research at Reputex. \u201cThe closure of a large coal generator is likely to have a negligible impact on residential electricity bills.\u201d But according to Price, in a brief to clients of his firm Frontier Economics, that did not \u201cring true\u201d and he modelled the example of Hazelwood, a brown coal-fired power station that produces over 20% of Victoria\u2019s electricity and produces 3% of Australia\u2019s greenhouse emissions, suddenly closing down under the scheme in July 2017. He found this could cause a short term price shock adding up to 25% to retail prices in Victoria, falling to between 14% and 15% in a few years as investments in other energy sources came on line. In New South Wales and South Australia, connected with Victoria in the east coast electricity market, the retail price increases would be an initial 13% or 14% falling to 8% or 9% over time, he said. Despite Price\u2019s praise for sections of his policy, Labor\u2019s climate spokesman Mark Butler said Price \u201chelped Tony Abbott write his Direct Action policy\u201d and \u201cregularly rails against our policies to expand renewable energy, so I\u2019m not surprised that he is again campaigning against our Climate Change Action Plan\u201d. \u201cLabor has responded to overwhelming calls in the electricity industry for government to adopt an orderly framework around the transition from Australia\u2019s heavy reliance on coal fired power to modern, clean energy. Mr Price\u2019s opinion is directly at odds with modelling from the ANU and energy analysis firm, Reputex. That modelling supports electricity industry projections that average household power bills will decline in real terms over the period to 2020,\u201d Butler said. Jotzo, an associate professor at the Crawford School of public policy, and Mazouz, a principal at the Centre for International Economics consultancy, responded to the substance of Price\u2019s claims. \u201cThe key point is that without effective carbon pricing, an exit mechanism of some form is needed for an orderly transition from old coal-fired power stations to renewables. There is a broad consensus about this in the policy community and in industry. Danny Price attacks our proposal for how this could be achieved but does not offer any solutions,\u201d they said. Jotzo pointed out that their plan included \u201ca safety valve in case the costs turn out unacceptably high. As we state in our paper, government would not need to go ahead with the closure scheme if the bids in the reverse auction were judged too high. And as Frontier point out, high expected price impacts would be visible through high payments demanded for exit, so the government would know what to expect.\u201d And Mazouz said the Frontier modelling \u201cassumes that the market is taken by surprise by the sudden retirement of an entire plant\u201d. \u201cThis would not be so. The market would know the schedule for plant retirement, and indeed a plant could be phased out gradually by retiring the several units that a power station consists of one at a time. Our proposal is all about orderly transition, and any policy mechanism can be designed to be gradual and fully predictable,\u201d he said. Price last week said \u201cthe emissions intensity part of Labor\u2019s plan appears to be exactly what we were proposing for Malcolm Turnbull and Nick Xenophon in 2009\u201d. Price modelled the scheme for Turnbull and Xenophon when Turnbull was the opposition leader and considering his response to the then Labor government\u2019s cap and trade ETS. Turnbull lauded it as a \u201ccheaper, greener, smarter scheme\u201d and said it could deliver deeper cuts to greenhouse emissions but impose far lower increases in electricity prices. But the then prime minister, Kevin Rudd, dismissed it as a \u201cmagic pudding\u201d. Price said the new Labor policy was \u201ca bit light on detail but it looks pretty much the same [as the Turnbull 2009 plan]. Malcolm Turnbull thought it was a good idea then. I\u2019m delighted the Labor party is proposing it now.\u201d Price \u2013 who the government recently appointed to the Climate Change Authority and who acted as an adviser on Direct Action \u2013 said the Coalition would probably have to move to a similar scheme itself in order to meet its own emissions reduction targets. \u201cThe government\u2019s Direct Action plan \u2013 its safeguard mechanism \u2013 could be modified to create exactly this same type of scheme,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought that was the most likely way for them to go after the review they have scheduled for 2017, because they are obviously going to have to make changes to meet even their existing targets and this is a low-cost way to do it. \u201cIt is actually emerging as an idea with the potential to be adopted by both major parties.\u201d Under Direct Action the \u201csafeguards mechanism\u201d is supposed to ensure increased emissions from heavy industry and electricity generators do not undo the reductions bought through the government\u2019s $2.5bn scheme, by setting baselines for their emissions. At the moment the baselines are lenient, ensuring industries don\u2019t \u201cgo rogue\u201d but not seeking to reduce their greenhouse emissions. But many observers, including business groups, expect they will have to be tightened after 2017 to gradually reduce industrial emissions. And that would turn Direct Action into much the same scheme as Labor is proposing.",

      "bodyText": "The Turnbull government has revealed some of its budget plans to the media ahead of Tuesday\u2019s budget. But it has kept important details quiet. For example, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, says workers earning more than $80,000 will get a modest tax cut, but he isn\u2019t saying whether that tax cut will be legislated before the election \u2013 or after it. That means it may never come into effect, but his government will hope to get positive publicity for it anyway. So, here\u2019s what the media has been told will be in Tuesday\u2019s budget, with some of the blank spaces filled in. 1. Extra funding for the corporate regulator The government has promised to boost funding to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic). It means Asic will get $127m for an upgrade to its surveillance systems \u2013 with $6m coming from the federal government and $121m coming from Australia\u2019s banks. The regulator will also shift to a user-pays funding model, so banks and other financial institutions will have to pay for the cost of their own regulation, rather than having taxpayers foot the bill. What was left out of the announcement? The Abbott government cut $120m from Asic\u2019s funding in its 2014 budget, so the announcement of \u201cextra\u201d funding for a technology upgrade does not mean extra in the way we think it does. Successive federal governments have also cut Asic\u2019s staff numbers by 14.4% since 2013-14 \u2013 from 1,834 to 1,569 - so the regulator\u2019s resources remain heavily diminished. Few details were released to show how the government\u2019s proposed user-pays funding model will work. There are concerns it will make the regulator more beholden to the banks. 2. Extra funding for schools The government has plans to provide $1.2bn in extra funding to schools across the final two years of the Gonski plan \u2013 2018 and 2019 \u2013 and a third year, 2020, as part of its new $73.6bn \u201cstudent achievement plan\u201d. The extra $1.2bn funding is conditional on the states accepting testing and minimum standards. What was left out of the announcement? At the 2013 election, the Coalition promised to match the so-called Gonski funding model before backtracking, with Abbott eventually cutting $30bn (over 10 years) from education in his 2014 budget. Then, at the recent meeting of the Council of Australian Governments in March, the government proposed giving states the power to raise their own income taxes while taking full responsibility for state school funding. If the proposal was accepted, it would have neutered the Gonski debate, but the states roundly rejected it. The recent announcement is a response to those developments, with education minister Simon Birmingham saying he plans to negotiate with the states over coming months to see how his \u201cextra funding\u201d will be distributed. 3. First corporate tax cut in 15 years, and tax cut for people earning more than $80,000 The government has revealed plans to cut the corporate tax rate, which is currently 30%. It also says people earning more than $80,000 a year could get a modest tax cut, via an increase in the $80,000 threshold for the 32.5% per cent marginal tax rate. What don\u2019t we know? Few details have been released. Reports say the corporate tax cut is expected to be small in the first year and will grow in following years, but that\u2019s where the detail ends. Will those tax cuts become a reality? It depends on the outcome of the election. 4. Negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount Sorry. The government will not touch negative gearing or the CGT discount in this budget, despite calls from numerous economists to reform one or both policy settings. 5. Infrastructure Malcolm Turnbull is promising to establish a $50m \u201cinnovative financing unit\u201d to devise funding deals for multibillion-dollar transport projects as part of a grand plan to reduce commuting time and make our cities more liveable. He envisions a \u201c30-minute city\u201d where no worker\u2019s commute time is greater than half an hour. What was left out of the announcement? He did not say how he thinks his ideal 30-minute commute will feasibly become reality, or when. 6. Small and medium business tax plan extended from last year\u2019s budget The government plans to extend last year\u2019s popular tax package for small and medium-sized businesses, according to reports. The package was the centrepiece of the Abbott government\u2019s second budget, and included an instant asset write-off for items worth $20,000 or less. It is due to expire on 30 June 2017. What don\u2019t we know? Few details have been released. We don\u2019t know if the instant asset write-off policy will be extended, or become permanent. We also don\u2019t know if the package will have new sweeteners. 7. Dental plan The government has promised $5bn in dental health funding over the next four years, including $2.1bn for a so-called Child and Adult Public Dental Scheme. It means millions of low-income adults with concession cards \u2013 and every Australian child \u2013 will be eligible for subsidised dental care. What was left out of the announcement? The health minister, Sussan Ley, says the deal will be enshrined in legislation to provide long-term certainty, but she hasn\u2019t said when that will happen. A war of words has also broken out between the Coalition and Labor and the Australian Dental Association over what the funding \u201cactually\u201d means. The ADA says the government\u2019s plan will cut funding from Labor\u2019s $615m a year scheme (currently in place) to just $425m a year, representing a $200m a year reduction. But Ley says that claim is rubbish because low take-up rates of Labor\u2019s $615m a year policy mean only $312m is being spent each year anyway. 8. Superannuation tax concessions The government is expected to close a super tax concession loophole by applying a 30% tax rate on contributions for people earning $180,000 or more. According to reports, the government will net $2bn a year from the change (just 380,000 out of 13 million taxpayers earned more than $180,000 in 2013-14). Labor has said it will reduce the current threshold from $300,000 to $250,000, so the Coalition\u2019s plan goes further. What don\u2019t we know? The government hasn\u2019t confirmed this. 9. Defence The government has agreed to spend $50bn on 12 new submarines. The award of the contract to French shipbuilder DCNS means the fleet will be new Barracuda-class submarines. They will be built to Australian specifications, in South Australia by local workers. What don\u2019t we know? The government has not signed the contract, and we don\u2019t know when it will happen. Turnbull says he hopes to do so this year.",

Reports say the corporate tax cut is expected to be small in the first year and will grow in following years, but that\u2019s where the detail ends. Will those tax cuts become a reality? It depends on the outcome of the election.</p> <p><strong>4. Negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount</strong></p> <p>Sorry. The government will not touch negative gearing or the CGT discount in this budget, despite calls from numerous economists to reform one or both policy settings.</p> <p><strong>5. Infrastructure</strong></p> <p>Malcolm Turnbull is promising to establish a $50m \u201cinnovative financing unit\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/29/50bn-investment-banking-style-unit-to-fund-transport-projects\">to devise funding deals for multibillion-dollar transport projects as part of a grand plan</a> to reduce commuting time and make our cities more liveable. He envisions a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/address-at-the-national-cities-summit-melbourne\">30-minute city</a>\u201d where no worker\u2019s commute time is greater than half an hour.</p> <p><em>What was left out of the announcement? </em>He did not say how he thinks his ideal 30-minute commute will feasibly become reality, or when. </p> <p><strong>6. Small and medium business tax plan extended from last year\u2019s budget</strong></p> <p>The government plans to extend last year\u2019s popular tax package for small and medium-sized businesses, according to <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/politics/budget-2016-set-to-reward-turnbulls-tradies-20160429-goietb\">reports</a>. The package was the centrepiece of the Abbott government\u2019s second budget, and included an instant asset write-off for items worth $20,000 or less. It is due to expire on 30 June 2017.</p> <p><em>What don\u2019t we know?</em> Few details have been released. We don\u2019t know if the instant asset write-off policy will be extended, or become permanent. We also don\u2019t know if the package will have new sweeteners.</p> <p><strong>7. Dental plan</strong></p> <p>The government has promised <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/dental-plan-turnbull-government-promises-every-child-subsidised-dental-care-20160422-godd7o.html\">$5bn in dental health funding over the next four years</a>, including $2.1bn for a so-called Child and Adult Public Dental Scheme. It means millions of low-income adults with concession cards \u2013 and every Australian child \u2013 will be eligible for subsidised dental care.</p> <p><em>What was left out of the announcement? </em>The health minister, Sussan Ley, says the deal will be enshrined in legislation to provide long-term certainty, but she hasn\u2019t said when that will happen. A war of words has also broken out between the Coalition and Labor and the Australian Dental Association over what the funding \u201cactually\u201d means. The ADA says the government\u2019s plan will cut funding from Labor\u2019s $615m a year scheme (currently in place) to just $425m a year, representing a $200m a year reduction. But Ley says that claim is rubbish because low take-up rates of Labor\u2019s $615m a year policy mean only $312m is being spent each year anyway.</p> <p><strong>8. Superannuation tax concessions</strong></p> <p>The government is expected to close a super tax concession loophole by applying a 30% tax rate on contributions for people earning $180,000 or more. <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/business/federal-budget/federal-budget-2016-coalition-plans-tougher-crackdown-on-super-to-outflank-labor-20160419-go9u61.html\">According to reports</a>, the government will net $2bn a year from the change (just 380,000 out of 13 million taxpayers earned more than $180,000 in 2013-14). Labor has said it will reduce the current threshold from $300,000 to $250,000, so the Coalition\u2019s plan goes further.</p> <p><em>What don\u2019t we know?</em> The government hasn\u2019t confirmed this.</p> <p><strong>9. Defence</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/26/france-to-build-australias-new-submarine-fleet-as-50bn-contract-awarded\">The government has agreed to spend $50bn on 12 new submarines</a>. The award of the contract to French shipbuilder DCNS means the fleet will be new Barracuda-class submarines. They will be built to Australian specifications, in South Australia by local workers. </p> <p><em>What don\u2019t we know?</em> The government has not signed the contract, and we don\u2019t know when it will happen. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/27/turnbull-warns-labors-emissions-trading-schemes-will-destroy-jobs\">Turnbull says he hopes to do so this year</a>. </p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Australian Marriage Equality has announced it will target more than 30 electorates at the federal election, many of which are occupied by Coalition MPs who have not backed same-sex marriage. AME national director, Rodney Croome, said the campaign was the largest it had ever undertaken and would include events in more than 30 seats across every state. \u201cIt is our goal to build community and parliamentary support before and after the election and we will be running campaigns across a wide range of seats including Hume, Hasluck, Indi, Moncrieff, Mayo and Bowman,\u201d Croome said. \u201cThe electorates have been chosen because there are strong candidates who support marriage equality, sitting members who can be persuaded to support and where there are strong local campaigns already in existence.\u201d The electorates of Hume, Moncrieff, Mayo and Bowman are occupied by Coalition MPs Angus Taylor, Steven Ciobo, Jamie Briggs and Andrew Laming, all of who AME categorises as undecided or undeclared on same-sex marriage. Hasluck is held by Coalition MP Ken Wyatt, who AME notes is opposed to same-sex marriage. Indi is held by independent Cathy McGowan, who is in favour of same-sex marriage but sits on a razor-thin margin after defeating Liberal MP Sophie Mirabella at the 2013 election. AME will hold community forums to allow voters to ask questions and share personal stories to persuade others that marriage equality is an important issue. It hopes to win over MPs, senators and candidates from all major parties and independents. The campaign begins in Hume, with a community forum on Saturday in Goulburn. Further town hall-style meetings are planned for Campbelltown and the Blue Mountains this weekend and next. Croome said \u201cmarriage equality is an issue that unites supporters and candidates of all major parties and this election provides an opportunity to showcase that\u201d. \u201cRegardless of who wins government and whether there is a plebiscite, we need a strong cross-party majority if marriage equality is to be achieved.\u201d Croome said the campaign is focused on values of love, fairness and equality. It will feature personal stories to show the importance of members of our families, our friends, neighbours and workmates having the same aspirations and opportunities as every Australian. \u201cWe are also sending the message that a plebiscite is unnecessary and expensive and calling for parliament to resolve the issue as soon as possible.\u201d Labor has pledged that, if elected, it would hold a parliamentary vote on same-sex marriage within 100 days of the next election. At a Guardian Australia event in March, the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said: \u201cWe need to campaign at next election for candidates who will vote for marriage equality. If you want to have marriage equality you need to change the government.\u201d Labor MPs will be allowed a free vote on same-sex marriage, but the party\u2019s policy will bind MPs to vote in favour if the issue is still being debated in two terms\u2019 time. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, supports marriage equality and opposed holding a plebiscite when the then prime minister, Tony Abbott, suggested one at a joint party room meeting in August last year. But since becoming prime minister in September, Turnbull has maintained the Coalition\u2019s plans for a plebiscite. On Thursday, Turnbull said supporters of same-sex marriage were \u201cunlikely to be disappointed\u201d by the result of a plebiscite, as he predicted the result would be in favour of marriage equality.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Israel\u2019s military has ordered a Palestinian journalist to be held for four months without charges or trial. The military said Omar Nazzal is being held in administrative detention on suspicion of \u201cunlawful activity\u201d for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a PLO faction that has been labelled a terrorist organisation by Israel. His lawyer, Mahmoud Hassan, said he believes his client, a leading member of the Palestinian journalists\u2019 union, is being targeted because of his political activism. Hassan noted that under the system of administrative detention, the defence is not shown any alleged evidence against them. Nazzal, 53, has been in custody since he was seized at an Israeli-run crossing between the West Bank and Jordan last month, while traveling to a meeting of the European Federation of Journalists. The journalist headed Palestine Today, a TV station affiliated with the militant group Islamic Jihad, for five months, but quit earlier this year shortly before Israel shut the broadcaster down. He also had ties to the PFLP which in the past was involved in attacks on Israelis. Hassan denied his client was linked to violence, adding: \u201cThis arrest is a political arrest.\u201d Monday\u2019s court announcement comes on the eve of World Press Freedom Day, the lead-up to which Palestinians have been using to condemn Israel. Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian political leader, on Monday urged immediate intervention to ensure Israel was \u201caccountable for the blatant and planned escalation against Palestinian media\u201d. The journalists\u2019 union says that Israel is also holding in detention another 19 Palestinian journalists and students of journalism, one of them for more than 20 years. The number of Palestinians in administrative detention reached 627 at the end of February, according to official prison service figures regularly published by the Israeli rights group B\u2019Tselem. Critics say Israel\u2019s large-scale use of the practice amounts to a violation of rules of due process. The number of administrative detainees has doubled since the start of the latest round of Israeli-Palestinian violence in September. Since the autumn, attacks by Palestinians have claimed the lives of 28 Israelis and two Americans, while about 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli security forces.",

      "bodyText": "Progress was slow, which is not usually the case when Liam Livingstone is involved, though this was not his fault. Twelve months ago the 22-year-old Cumbrian hit 350 from 138 balls when playing for Nantwich against lowly Caldy in a 45-over Cup match, which prompted raised eyebrows beyond the north-west. As did an unfortunate incident in an Ashford bar after Lancashire\u2019s Twenty20 quarter-final victory against Kent in August last year. A brawl left him with 20 stitches on his face. Now Livingstone demands attention for more conventional reasons. After 138 balls at Taunton he was on 98. He flicked a ball from Jamie Overton to mid-wicket and scampered two. Thus he registered his maiden first-class century in his second first-class innings. In his first a fortnight ago he hit 70 against Nottinghamshire. His progress here was certainly not slow. But there was rain in the afternoon and there remains a very sluggish pitch on which nine wickets have fallen in 157 overs. And Somerset bowled quite well. Livingstone is not an overtly muscular man, who pummels the ball as if gripping a sledgehammer. He stands tall, willowy and right-handed at the crease; the process of batting seems straightforward enough but he must have steely wrists since he generates surprising power when exploring the leg-side boundary. He obviously witnessed KP\u2019s flamingo shot in his teens. As a supposed one-day specialist \u2013 he played in all 16 of Lancashire\u2019s T20 matches last summer \u2013 Livingstone has made quite a start to his first-class career. Clearly Ashley Giles, the shrewdest of cricket directors, has been inclined to allow him a careful baptism against the red ball. Livingstone is batting at seven for Lancashire but this does not denote all\u2011rounder status even if he propels the odd leg-break. It is easier to conduct a reconnaissance of first-class cricket from there. But if he keeps batting like this he will have to climb the order soon. He is embarking on an increasingly common route to the top having made his initial impact in the shortest form of the game. Livingstone is one to watch for sure. However the superlatives and the Pietersen parallels had better remain a little muted for a little longer. Conditions at Taunton have been friendly for batsmen, probably too friendly for a decent game of cricket \u2013 unless Somerset are intimidated by Lancashire\u2019s mighty total of 493 for nine declared. By the close the home side were 14 without loss.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\u201cBBC faces charter ban on Saturday Strictly\u201d, splashed the Mail on Sunday, with similar front pages in the Sunday Times and Telegraph. The Tory press was briefed that the BBC charter would bar the corporation from competing with ITV and others in primetime. No Strictly up against X&nbsp;Factor, no Night Manager up against ITV Sunday drama. Forget the elixir of competition: the BBC must back down. This is just the latest in a long series of threats leaked or floated in the run-up to this month\u2019s white paper on the BBC\u2019s charter renewal. Some predictions may be wishful thinking from competitors, but many emanate from rightwing BBC haters who find its success an affront to their beliefs: a public broadcaster ought to fail while commercial rivals thrive according to a market ideology where private must always outdo public. If the BBC, with half Sky\u2019s income, keeps winning in quality and popularity, the reason can only be unfair competition. That core belief is strongly held by the culture secretary, John Whittingdale \u2013 a longtime BBC basher. What\u2019s he up to? After embarrassing newspaper stories, he is wooing back the Tory press with an attack on the BBC. David Cameron may be glad of a BBC distraction to placate his party\u2019s outraged Brexiteers. Floated so far is an array of plans to undermine the BBC: its political independence; its universal offer of something for everyone; its funding; children\u2019s and arts programmes; and BBC online. Whittingdale warns that the charter will not be for 11 years, as previously, but five-year reviews to keep the BBC on a short tether. Let\u2019s start with this primetime ban. Never mind cheating licence-payers out of seeing what they like best when they want it, how would it work? Imagine an episode of W1A where BBC executives agonise over finding surefire low-rating shows for weekends. Go dark with The Sky at Night? What about a musical called Springtime for Hitler? Or a dull show about baking cakes. But no! Bake Off became an unexpected mega hit. Why make top programmes only to hide them at inconvenient times? The aim is to demolish the BBC as a widely loved universal broadcaster: Rupert Murdoch wants it shrunk to a small information channel few would subscribe to. His son James made the case in his notorious MacTaggart lecture, accusing the BBC of \u201cthrottling\u201d the market. Last month Whittingdale again suggested that BBC funds should be top-sliced and given to other broadcasters. In the past this \u201ccontestable funding\u201d was proposed for arts programmes, but strongly opposed by the arts council and the creative industries. This time it\u2019s for children\u2019s programmes, though CBBC and CBeebies are hugely popular, parents knowing children get good quality and no ads. The BBC makes 94% of British children\u2019s programmes, while others fail to invest. Why shouldn\u2019t ITV put some of its \u00a3850m profit into good children\u2019s TV, without raiding the BBC? Because it doesn\u2019t want to. When Canada and New Zealand top-sliced public broadcasters to give cash to others, it failed because they couldn\u2019t find commercial channels willing to show serious programmes. The only aim of the top-slicers is to slash BBC funds. Most serious to the BBC\u2019s reputation is the plan drawn up for Whittingdale by David Clementi, a former chairman of Virgin Money and Prudential, to create a single board running the BBC, dominated by political appointees. The current trust is separate to the executive board that runs the BBC day to day. But for the first time this single board running the corporation would be stacked by the government of the day. The BBC could no longer claim to be politically independent. Foreign powers would rightly say the BBC was controlled by the British government. The chilling effect of government interference was felt immediately after the last election when the BBC was ambushed, as if in revenge, and the chancellor, warning of the BBC\u2019s \u201cimperial ambitions\u201d, swiped \u00a3650m without public or parliamentary consultation. The new BBC board would be overseen by Ofcom \u2013 a competition regulator. This week\u2019s story suggests the BBC would submit to competition rules, as if there should be a level playing field in broadcasting. That spells the end of the BBC as our great national broadcaster, paid for and enjoyed by all. But Ofcom shows no appetite for BBC-wrecking: its latest annual report on television finds BBC1 scoring highest in all measures of quality and distinctiveness, closely followed by BBC2, with ITV, Channel 4 and Channel&nbsp;5 well behind. Whittingdale keeps opening new fronts, recently complaining the BBC is not \u201cdistinctive\u201d enough. The corporation\u2019s reply is well worth reading: it shows how much more news, current affairs and drama it offers, with less entertainment, soap and films than ITV. For trust in online news, the BBC soars above others. Given Whittingdale\u2019s long history as a BBC critic \u2013 he called the licence fee \u201cworse than the poll tax\u201d \u2013 sabotage is to be expected in the upcoming charter proposals. But does the government really want to take on such a popular institution? In the government\u2019s own consultation, 75% of those surveyed are \u201cglad the BBC exists\u201d, 80% say it serves its audiences well, and 75% say the licence fee is the best method, with under 10% opposed. At \u00a312 a month against an average \u00a361 Sky bundle, no wonder 76% say the BBC is good value. Recently a private experiment with people who claim never to use the BBC took away BBC channels from all their devices. After nine days all begged to get the BBC back: they and their children missed BBC programmes they had wrongly thought were on commercial channels. Despite previous resistance to the licence fee, they thought the price of one Subway sandwich per week was well worth all they had missed. But don\u2019t count on common sense. David Cameron\u2019s government often drives straight into brick walls in plain view when pursuing passionately held ideological objectives. The question is how loudly fans of The Archers, Radio&nbsp;3, Strictly, Bake Off, War and Peace or Match of the Day will defend this soundscape of the nation \u2013 this rare social glue in a fissiparous society \u2013 and show they are all goggling together, as bonded to the BBC as they are to the NHS.",

Some predictions may be wishful thinking from competitors, but many emanate from rightwing BBC haters who find its success an affront to their beliefs: a public broadcaster ought to fail while commercial rivals thrive according to a market ideology where private must always outdo public. If the BBC, with half Sky\u2019s income, keeps winning in quality and popularity, the reason can only be unfair competition.</p> <p>That core belief is strongly held by the culture secretary, John Whittingdale \u2013 a longtime BBC basher. What\u2019s he up to? After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/15/john-whittingdale-whorephobia-mainstream-sex-workers-dominatrix-contempt-women\" title=\"\">embarrassing newspaper stories</a>, he is wooing back the Tory press with an attack on the BBC. David Cameron may be glad of a BBC distraction to placate his party\u2019s outraged Brexiteers.</p> <p>Floated so far is an array of plans to undermine the BBC: its political independence; its universal offer of something for everyone; its funding; children\u2019s and arts programmes; and BBC online. Whittingdale warns that the charter will not be for 11 years, as previously, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/14/battle-for-the-bbc\" title=\"\">five-year reviews</a> to keep the BBC on a short tether.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with this primetime ban. Never mind cheating licence-payers out of seeing what they like best when they want it, how would it work? Imagine an episode of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/15/w1a-bbc-licence-fee-john-whittingdale\" title=\"\">W1A</a> where BBC executives agonise over finding surefire low-rating shows for weekends.

In the past this \u201ccontestable funding\u201d was proposed for arts programmes, but strongly opposed by the arts council and the creative industries. This time it\u2019s for children\u2019s programmes, though CBBC and CBeebies are hugely popular, parents knowing children get good quality and no ads.</p> <p>The BBC makes 94% of British children\u2019s programmes, while others fail to invest. Why shouldn\u2019t ITV put some of its \u00a3850m profit into good children\u2019s TV, without raiding the BBC? Because it doesn\u2019t want to. When Canada and New Zealand top-sliced public broadcasters to give cash to others, it failed because they couldn\u2019t find commercial channels willing to show serious programmes. The only aim of the top-slicers is to slash BBC funds.</p> <p>Most serious to the BBC\u2019s reputation is the plan drawn up for Whittingdale by David Clementi, a former chairman of Virgin Money and Prudential, to create <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/01/bbc-regulation-ofcom-trust-david-clementi\" title=\"\">a single board running the BBC, dominated by political appointees</a>. The current trust is separate to the executive board that runs the BBC day to day. But for the first time this single board running the corporation would be stacked by the government of the day. The BBC could no longer claim to be politically independent. Foreign powers would rightly say the BBC was controlled by the British government.</p> <p>The chilling effect of government interference was felt immediately after the last election when the BBC was ambushed, as if in revenge, and the chancellor, warning of the BBC\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/05/osborne-accuses-bbc-of-imperial-ambitions-and-calls-for-savings\" title=\"\">\u201cimperial ambitions\u201d</a>, swiped <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/05/george-osborne-cut-benefits-cap-20000-year-outside-london\" title=\"\">\u00a3650m</a> without public or parliamentary consultation.</p> <p>The new BBC board would be overseen by Ofcom \u2013 a competition regulator. This week\u2019s story suggests the BBC would submit to competition rules, as if there should be a level playing field in broadcasting. That spells the end of the BBC as our great national broadcaster, paid for and enjoyed by all.</p> <p>But Ofcom shows no appetite for BBC-wrecking: its latest annual report on television finds BBC1 scoring highest in all measures of quality and distinctiveness, closely followed by BBC2, with ITV, Channel 4 and Channel\u00a05 well behind.</p> <p>Whittingdale keeps opening new fronts, recently complaining the BBC is not \u201cdistinctive\u201d enough. The <a href=\"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/reports/pdf/bbc_distinctiveness_april2016.pdf\" title=\"\">corporation\u2019s reply</a> is well worth reading: it shows how much more news, current affairs and drama it offers, with less entertainment, soap and films than ITV. For trust in online news, the BBC soars above others.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In an experiment people who claim not to use BBC channels had them taken away. After nine days all begged for them back</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Given Whittingdale\u2019s long history as a BBC critic \u2013 he called the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/oct/29/bbc-licence-fee-poll-tax-tory-john-whittingdale\" title=\"\">licence fee \u201cworse than the poll tax\u201d</a> \u2013 sabotage is to be expected in the upcoming charter proposals.

At \u00a312 a month against an average \u00a361 Sky bundle, no wonder 76% say the BBC is good value.</p> <p>Recently a private experiment with people who claim never to use the BBC took away BBC channels from all their devices. After nine days all begged to get the BBC back: they and their children missed BBC programmes they had wrongly thought were on commercial channels. Despite previous resistance to the licence fee, they thought the price of one Subway sandwich per week was well worth all they had missed.</p> <p>But don\u2019t count on common sense. David Cameron\u2019s government often drives straight into brick walls in plain view when pursuing passionately held ideological objectives. The question is how loudly fans of The Archers, Radio\u00a03, Strictly, Bake Off, War and Peace or Match of the Day will defend this soundscape of the nation \u2013 this rare social glue in a fissiparous society \u2013 and show they are all goggling together, as bonded to the BBC as they are to the NHS.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of the big clashes of the mayoral campaign has been over the promise by Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan to freeze public transport fares for the full four years of a mayoral term. Conservative Zac Goldsmith has insisted that this would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the city, causing a loss of revenue that would force Khan to slash investment in service upgrades and line extensions and lessen the potential for increasing house building as a result. Khan has argued that the cost of his plans would be comfortably met by a combination of efficiencies and a more ambitious exploitation of Transport for London\u2019s (TfL) land assets and saleable skills. This argument has been a novel feature of the contest. Normally, it\u2019s Tories who bang on about \u201cwaste\u201d in public bodies, especially TfL which for years they routinely called \u201cbloated.\u201d Now we have Goldsmith railing against cuts to TfL\u2019s budgets - which is what a fares freeze would amount to, if compared with fares increases - and we have Khan calling TfL \u201cgood, but flabby.\u201d Numbers have been bandied around by both sides. Khan claimed from the off that his freeze would deprive TfL of \u00a3450m over four years it might have otherwise expected and that this could be easily coped with. Then, BBC London\u2019s Tom Edwards reported that a TfL briefing document said the true cost would be \u00a31.9bn - over four times the figure claimed by Khan. A TfL official told Edwards that the difference was largely due to Khan failing to take into account that the fares yield would be increasing because of more and more passengers using the Tube, buses and so on and additional fares income from Crossrail when that starts coming into service from 2018. The \u00a31.9bn figure was, naturally, seized upon with glee by Goldsmith, who has occasionally rounded it up to \u00a32bn for good measure. But this number too came under scrutiny when TfL commissioner Mike Brown appeared before the London Assembly in February. He said that \u00a31.9bn would be the cost of the Khan freeze over the five-year period of TfL\u2019s latest business plan, rather than the four years of a mayoral term. In other words, about 80% of \u00a31.9bn, which leaves about \u00a31.5bn. Brown was asked by Labour AM and transport committee chair Val Shawcross to explain how the \u00a31.9bn figure had been arrived at. Brown, quite properly not wishing to take sides, said that Khan\u2019s figure of \u00a3450m was \u201cperfectly understandable\u201d but that there were \u201cdifferent assumptions that underpin different numbers.\u201d He told Shawcross the TfL figure assumed that fares would be going up by inflation as measured by the retail price index (RPI) plus 1%. If RPI inflation remained at 1% as it has been, then, as things stood, TfL would lose an annual 2% increase in fares each year for four years as a result of a freeze. By that calculation, said Brown, the figure would be \u00a3900m. However, Brown went on to say that TfL\u2019s figures did not assume that RPI inflation would stay at 1%, but would actually rise to 1.9% in 2017 and to 3.5% in 2018, 2019 and 2020. It was from these assumptions that the figure of \u00a31.9bn had been generated. How solid are those assumptions? As Tom Edwards explained, TfL says its RPI forecast is based on a variety of other forecasts, including those of the Office for Budget Responsibility and the Greater London Authority. Shawcross challenged these, saying that the 3.5% RPI projections were far higher than those of the Bank of England, which uses a different measure of inflation - the consumer price index (CPI). She added that the TfL business plan is, in any case, out of date. There have been other numbers brought to the debate. After Khan launched his manifesto in early March an experienced and respected London politics reporter put figures to him obtained from an experienced and respected watcher of TfL\u2019s finances. These suggested a fares freeze could cost \u00a3800m-\u00a3900m. Khan said that even if he accepted that figure he could make savings \u201cway above \u00a3800m.\u201d He said he\u2019d met TfL privately \u201cand been reassured that I\u2019m in the right place,\u201d and that, \u201ceven Mike Brown accepts that by merging engineering functions - Tube and surface - you can save, in his words, hundreds of millions of pounds.\u201d Where did the \u00a3800m-\u00a3900m figure come from? I know the experienced and respected watcher of TfL finances in question. He has shared his workings. \u201cSimple maths,\u201d he said. His calculation was much as Brown\u2019s had been when he\u2019d told Shawcross that if RPI+1% increases over four years were assumed. I asked if they could they cope with a four year freeze and maintain its investment programme. Answer: \u201cOf course they could.\u201d The big question is how. Would there be heavy job losses? Would there be service cuts? Or is it, in truth, pretty difficult to say with certainty? There is no doubt that under the next mayor TfL will be making changes in how it goes about its business. It currently has an annual turnover of \u00a311.5bn. Whatever happens with fares, the chancellor is to deprive it of \u00a32.8bn by 2020/21. TfL is already trying to find \u00a316bn in efficiencies by the same year. TfL is a large and complex organisation. It has a public service running right the way through it, from top brass to station staff. It\u2019s finances are a big, forever moving picture. It is also to a great extent autonomous from the mayor and, as Brown accepted when meeting the Assembly, adept at protecting its budgets. People who have dealings with it respect it but also moan about it. For example, one local authority planner seeking to work with TfL on local street improvements says he was exasperated to have five TfL planners arrive at a meeting to discuss the project with a set of proposals already worked out with no prior consultation that weren\u2019t even suitable. \u201cWhat a waste of resources,\u201d he complained. How fair or typical that is, I cannot know. What I do know is that only Conservatives and people who speak publicly for TfL insist that a fares freeze is unaffordable. Everyone else who pores over these things says the opposite. That view can even be found among persons of some weight at City Hall. The message from that quarter is that Boris Johnson simply didn\u2019t have the will to insist on greater clarity and transparency in the accounts of his transport agency and to push for change accordingly. This hardly comes as a surprise. Would sustaining a four year public transport fares freeze require TfL to redefine itself under a mayor with focus and energy? I think so. Would that enable it to be affordable? Sounds like it to me.",

      "bodyText": "One of the stars of the last Flat season found her way back to the winner\u2019s enclosure on Monday when Found pulled off an impressive and rather cheeky success in the Mooresbridge Stakes at The Curragh. Best remembered for her Breeders\u2019 Cup defeat of the Derby hero Golden Horn, Found may now get her own stab at Epsom glory in the Coronation Cup next month. With just over a furlong to go, the four-year-old seemed on her way to a second defeat of the year when stuck on the rail behind Success Days and Fascinating Rock. Gradually a gap opened between the front pair and Ryan Moore threaded Found through it, the filly quickly easing clear for what looked a comfortable win in the end. Aidan O\u2019Brien, her trainer, was landing the Mooresbridge for the ninth time in total and the sixth time in seven years. He expressed surprise that Found had made as much progress since her defeat in a Listed race at the same track a month earlier, which may have had much to do with heavy going. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she had come forward as much, but she obviously did,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cShe\u2019s still not there and hopefully she\u2019s something to look forward to. Ryan was going to relax her today, as she was a little bit keen the last day.\u201d The trainer said Found\u2019s next race would be back at The Curragh in three weeks\u2019 time for the Tattersalls Gold Cup, following which she might go to Epsom\u2019s Derby meeting for the Coronation Cup. \u201cShe\u2019d get a break and then have one or two runs before the Arc.\u201d Fascinating Rock was not given a hard time in the final furlong when it was clear he had run his race, this being his first outing since beating Found in the Champion Stakes at Ascot in October. He is also expected to return for the Tattersalls Gold Cup, for which he is 7-2 to turn around the form with Found, the even\u2011money favourite. The result completed a productive couple of days for O\u2019Brien, who saddled the first three home in the 1,000 Guineas on Sunday. He will now be able to approach the coming fortnight of Derby trials with rather more confidence than he must have felt on Saturday night after the 2,000 Guineas flop of Air Force Blue. The most obvious Derby contender among his colts is US Army Ranger and the trainer hopes the horse will benefit from the Chester Vase this Thursday. \u201cHe won a slow-motion race here about a month ago, but it\u2019s not going to be slow motion at Chester,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe will be very green and will learn a lot from the experience.\u201d O\u2019Brien added that he expects to run Cook Islands in Chester\u2019s Dee Stakes on Friday and Idaho in the Derrinstown Derby Trial at Leopardstown on Sunday. He has seven entries for Lingfield\u2019s Derby trial on Saturday but that course is waterlogged in places with more rain due on Monday night, so it remains to be seen if any serious Epsom contenders will be sent there. A minor handicap at Bath nearly ended in calamity when two members of the groundstaff remained on the track until the runners were almost upon them. It appears the pair, employed as divot-treaders, believed the race was over five furlongs rather than the actual two miles and had not expected the runners to pass a second time. The leading two jockeys saw them in time to take evasive action, at which point the pair ran off the track. The stewards forwarded a report to the British Horseracing Authority, which may take action against Bath racecourse in consequence.",

      "bodyText": "Jake Ball just looks right. He is tall but not a beanpole, has an athletic rhythmical run rather than the awkward gangliness possessed by some of the giants and, without being seduced by the extra bounce he might gain, is beyond the brisk side of fast-medium when he hits his straps. He has good shoulders, hits the deck hard, moves the ball off the seam, has an excellent command of length and line and, well, has all the attributes at the age of 25 to be a successful international bowler. Even before this match there has been talk that when, in the middle of next week, the England selectors announce their squad for the first Test, Ball\u2019s name will appear as one of the support pace bowlers. Now, after his new-ball performance set the Yorkshire innings back on its heels, the surprise would be if he was not in the squad. Ball took the wickets of three Test batsmen \u2013 Adam Lyth, Gary Ballance and Joe Root \u2013 the first and last of them golden ducks, in an opening burst that brought him three for 20. This was high-class bowling. The left-handed Lyth succumbed to the opening delivery of the innings, which was right on the mark and on to the batsman a bit quicker than he might have expected, to strike him on the pad. It may have been missing off stump but the batsman was well beaten. Ballance was given a tricky time by both Ball and Broad, at his favourite Pavilion End. The spot in the England middle order vacated by James Taylor may well be filled by Ballance but he appears to have done little to alter the back-in-the-crease technique that got him into trouble last summer; it is all a bit stubborn. Ball, accurately surmising that the ball can be pitched a little further up to such a player, found one that also lifted and Chris Read took the catch. Root got a beauty: on a length, nibbling away and an excellent low catch by Riki Wessels to his left at first slip. From 24 for three Yorkshire, largely through the endeavour of Alex Lees, in partnerships with Jonny Bairstow (29) and Andrew Gale (21 not out), and despite a lengthy rain break after lunch, were able to close on 170 for four, a deficit of only 91.

    "webTitle": "Berta C\u00e1ceres murder: four men arrested over Honduran activist's death", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Four men have been arrested in connection with the murder of the Honduran indigenous activist Berta C\u00e1ceres, who was shot dead at her home two months ago. Two of those arrested are linked to the company building a hydroelectric dam which C\u00e1ceres had campaigned against. Sergio Ram\u00f3n Rodriguez, an engineer for the Agua Zarca dam being built by Desarrollos Energ\u00e9ticos SA (Desa), and Douglas Geovanny Bustillo, a retired military officer and the former head of Desa\u2019s security detail, were both detained on Monday morning, according to the Honduran public prosecutor\u2019s office. The four men were due to appear before a judge later on Monday, where prosecutors will outline their alleged links to the crime. C\u00e1ceres, who last year won the Goldman environmental prize for her work opposing the Agua Zarca dam on the Gualcarque River, had previously reported both men to authorities for making threats against her life. Rodriguez had allegedly threatened C\u00e1ceres just days before her death as she led a protest by her group the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (Copinh) to the river which is considered sacred by the indigenous Lenca people. C\u00e1ceres reported the incident to the authorities, and accused Desa of using local thugs to intimidate her. The arrests were made after police carried out 10 simultaneous early morning raids in the capital, Tegucigalpa, and the coastal cities La Ceiba and Trujillo. The other two detainees are Mariano D\u00edaz Ch\u00e1vez and Edison Atilio Duarte Meza. Duarte Meza is a former military officer; Mariano D\u00edaz Ch\u00e1vez is a member of the country\u2019s armed forces on active duty. The arrests come amid mounting pressure on the Honduran government to authorize an independent international investigation into the activist\u2019s murder, which has triggered widespread condemnation. C\u00e1ceres, who had reported 33 death threats linked to her campaign against the dam, was killed after two assailants broke into her house just before midnight on 2 March. The four detainees face charges linked to her murder and the attempted murder of her friend Gustavo Castro, director of Friends of the Earth Mexico, who was injured in the attack. The investigation thus far has been condemned by C\u00e1ceres\u2019 family, colleagues and independent observers. The first suspects were members of Copinh and Castro who were interviewed for several days. It took investigators 11 days to visit the offices of Desa. The family, who have also criticized the authorities for failing to communicate with them while leaking important information to the press, found out about the arrests on the news. Laura C\u00e1ceres, 23, the activist\u2019s youngest daughter, told the Guardian: \u201cThe Honduran state is too closely linked to the murder of my mother to carry out an independent investigation. It is the government who awarded the dam commission and the government who sent military and police to work with Desa\u2019s private security guards, who threatened my mother.\u201d \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for our struggle and the international pressure for justice, my mother\u2019s murder would already be extinct. We have woken up to this news but it doesn\u2019t change our demands for an international investigation,\u201d she said, speaking by telephone from the town of La Esperanza, where her mother was murdered. The government has so far rejected an offer by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to send a team of experts to Honduras to investigate into the murder of C\u00e1ceres and other high-profile activists. Honduras is the world\u2019s most dangerous country for environmental rights defenders, with 109 murdered between 2010 and 2015, according to the NGO Global Witness. This article was amended on 3 May 2016. An earlier version described Gustavo Castro as a coordinator of Greenpeace Mexico; he is director of Friends of the Earth Mexico.",

      "bodyText": "Some of the largest food producers in the US have successfully petitioned Congress to propose a change to the Freedom of Information Act that would shield their communications with boards overseen by the US Department of Agriculture from the scrutiny of the public, the Guardian has learned. The move follows a series of stories that showed the government-backed egg promoter, the American Egg Board, had attempted to stifle competition from Silicon Valley food startup Hampton Creek, in direct conflict with its mandate. Several agricultural lobbyists including United Egg Producers, the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association and the National Pork Producers Council have now sent a letter to the congressional subcommittee overseeing appropriations for the Department of Agriculture (USDA) asking to be exempted from Foia requests to their own respective promotional boards. The letter to the subcommittee reads, in part: We support inclusion of language in the Committee report urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to recognize that the research and promotion programs are funded solely with producer dollars, and therefore are not agencies of the Federal government or subject to the Freedom of Information Act (Foia). The language added to the bill reads thusly: The Committee notes that the commodity Research and Promotion boards that the agency oversees are not agencies of the federal government, nor are Research and Promotion programs funded with federal funds. The funding used to operate and carry out the activities of the various Research and Promotion programs is provided by producers and industry stakeholders, and employees of the boards are not federal employees. Therefore, the Committee urges USDA to recognize that such boards are not subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. Section 552. The bill has not yet been passed. The government-backed food marketing groups are called \u201ccheckoff\u201dprograms, dedicated to promoting individual commodities and backed by a levy on farmers. Their most recognizable presence is in the form of marketing slogans such as \u201cThe incredible, edible egg\u201d or \u201cBeef. It\u2019s what\u2019s for dinner\u201d. The administrators of checkoff programs are appointed by the USDA and the programs themselves are funded by a levy on goods sold. The supreme court has ruled that contributing to the programs is mandatory, and that the programs themselves constitute government speech. That decision was controversial \u2013 small producers have long argued that checkoffs exclusively serve the interests of the their largest competitors, and environmental and animal rights activists say checkoffs often obscure the cruelties of industrial farming. Last year the Guardian learned through a Freedom of Information Act request by attorney Jeffrey Light and Foia expert Ryan Shapiro that the USDA-backed American Egg Board (the egg industry checkoff) had advised Unilever on an ongoing lawsuit against Hampton Creek, a company that produces plant-based mayonnaise, and had agreed to attempt to use its influence to have Hampton Creek\u2019s Just Mayo removed from Whole Foods. Shapiro said the attempt to cast a shroud over shady dealings among checkoff groups came far too late. \u201cNow that some of their blatantly improper dealings have been exposed via Foia, instead of cleaning up their acts, these boards are attempting to exempt themselves from Foia altogether,\u201d Shapiro told the Guardian. \u201cBut as the already released documents demonstrate, these boards are sorely in need of greater transparency and must not be allowed to shroud their already opaque dealings with even more secrecy.\u201d The Foia expert also observed that no less a pro-business titan than the late Antonin Scalia would have disagreed with the producers\u2019 assessment of their own accountability. In a ruling slapping down a challenge to the checkoff programs\u2019 authority by a group of small farmers, Scalia wrote of the beef checkoff: \u201cThe program is authorized and the basic message prescribed by federal statute, and specific requirements for the promotions\u2019 content are imposed by federal regulations promulgated after notice and comment. The Secretary of Agriculture, a politically accountable official, oversees the program, appoints and dismisses the key personnel, and retains absolute veto power over the advertisements\u2019 content, right down to the wording.\u201d The proposed rule comes at an awkward time for its supporters: the US federal government is in the midst of a review across its entire breadth after a call for greater Foia responsiveness and accessibility. As recently as last week, a letter to US comptroller general Gene L Dodaro, signed by the leadership of both the house and senate judiciary committees, asked the Government Accountability Office to audit agencies for compliance. Josh Tetrick, CEO of Hampton Creek, said the proposed Foia exemption was an example of how far the food industry remains removed from everyday Americans. \u201cYou don\u2019t just wake up one morning with a food system that doesn\u2019t reflect our values,\u201d Tetrick said. \u201cIt happens over decades.\u201d Indeed, displeasure with the move appears to cross party lines. \u201cThis is crony capitalism organized by Washington at its worst,\u201d said Republican senator Mike Lee in an emailed statement. \u201cNot only is the federal government forcing market participants to collude, it is then actively engaging in a cover up of that collusion.\u201d This article has been updated to clarify the nature of checkoff programs",

      "bodyText": "David Conn is right (The other Hillsborough villain: the courts, 30 April). The bewigged end of law enforcement may find the uniformed end a bit rough and ready but it puts aside its distaste, rallies round its own and submits the bereaved to delay, expense and indignity. Look at the record. Jimmy Ashley, shot dead by police in 1998. Firearms officer acquitted on the direction of the judge 2001, though the family later get apology and compensation. Azelle Rodney, shot dead by police in 2005. Trial delayed to 2015 by police refusal to provide evidence to a coroner. Firearms officer acquitted. Jean Charles de Menezes shot dead by police 2005. Metropolitan police commissioner found guilty of Health and Safety Act breaches, despite unswerving support from London mayor Ken Livingstone. Anthony Grainger shot dead by police in 2012. Health and safety charges brought but judge and Crown Prosecution Service bow to police request to withhold evidence, which prevents a trial. Even where an inquest does bring in a verdict of unlawful killing, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the judiciary ride to the rescue. The policeman who killed Ian Tomlinson at the G20 demonstration in 2009 was acquitted at his trial in 2012. PC Ian Terry was shot dead by a colleague in a live fire training exercise in 2008. Despite an unlawful killing inquest verdict no charges brought. The death of mentally ill, ethnic minority citizen Sean Rigg in Brixton police station in 2008 resulted in a damning narrative inquest verdict in 2012, yet the CPS still hasn\u2019t charged anybody. The death of mentally ill, ethnic majority citizen Thomas Orchard in Exeter police station in 2012 has resulted in charges but a mistrial means more delay. In this century the police in England and Wales have shot dead 40+ men and one woman, and many more have died in police cells and vans. If the entrenched and intertwined establishment institutions are allowed to do it their way, there will be another half decade of legalistic obfuscation and an evasion of any responsibility over the Hillsborough disaster. As EP Thompson said of the Blair Peach proceedings, the decisive factor in keeping courts and prosecutors from ducking their duty is the expression, in loud and measured ways, of public concern. Mary Pimm and Nik Wood London \u2022 David Conn and Roger Domeneghetti (Morning Star, 30 April) identify the lack of attention on the legal system and the media, arising from the otherwise tremendous judgment in favour of the Hillsborough bereaved families, at last, after their 27 years of struggle to get justice. While access to justice is vital \u2013 and while those of us trying to recreate local community law centres to give this to some of those most in need as a result of legal aid cuts are right to do so \u2013 it is a disgrace that \u00a312.7m of public funding has been used defending the indefensible five top police officers, when this could have been used to fund legal representation for those facing benefit sanctions and homelessness evictions. And the truth is that the media generally have been responsible for all those negative images of Liverpool, of football supporters, and of the working class as a whole for three decades. Still there is no proper coverage given to the other victims of the South Yorkshire police, such as those attacked during the miners\u2019 strike at Orgreave. So, well done \u2013 and don\u2019t stop now. Without proper journalism and without properly publicly accountable and funded access to the legal system, there will still not be justice for those who need it. John Nicholson Chair, Greater Manchester Law Centre \u2022 In the aftermath of Hillsborough, David Conn is right to scrutinise the efficacy of the inquest system, referring to the \u201cferocious\u201d behaviour of some representatives of the authorities that were in the spotlight, and the need to avoid inquests degenerating into scarring adversarial battles. Reporting for the Harris Review last year (on self-inflicted deaths of young people in prison), we recommended that families of the deceased should have a right to public funding for legal representation at an inquest (which should not be means-tested). We also said that following a death there should be a \u201cduty of candour\u201d upon the relevant public bodies, and their staff, both towards those organisations responsible for investigating the death (including the coroner) and the families. Time to look again at these issues? Philip Leach Professor of human rights law, Middlesex University \u2022 The verdict reached by the jury in the second Hillsborough inquests is a triumph over an inadequate and unbalanced system of inquiry. The representatives of those who have lost their lives at the hands of public bodies face a significant disadvantage in obtaining legal representation on parity with the other interested parties. The inquest is an inquiry into the circumstances and cause of death. The representatives of the deceased are entitled to be represented but there can be no recovery of their legal expenses from their opponent, regardless of the verdict, and there is no public funding available except in exceptional circumstances. Very often the family of the deceased must foot the bill for legal representation. When the other interested party is the police, NHS or other public body, the taxpayer will meet the cost of its legal representation: David v Goliath. Apart from being unfair, the imbalance of representation at inquests can lead to miscarriages of justice, as the first Hillsborough inquests illustrate. But for the fortitude and determination of the families involved, the verdicts of accidental death would rest.

Reporting for the Harris Review last year (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/01/prison-staffing-shortages-young-adult-suicides-lord-harris\" title=\"\">on self-inflicted deaths of young people in prison</a>), we recommended that families of the deceased should have a right to public funding for legal representation at an inquest (which should not be means-tested). We also said that following a death there should be a \u201cduty of candour\u201d upon the relevant public bodies, and their staff, both towards those organisations responsible for investigating the death (including the coroner) and the families. Time to look again at these issues?<br /><strong>Philip Leach</strong><br /><em>Professor of human rights law, Middlesex University</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/01/hillsborough-inquest-survivor-adrian-tempany\">Hillsborough: \u2018Finally, we got justice\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u2022 The verdict reached by the jury in the second Hillsborough inquests is a triumph over an inadequate and unbalanced system of inquiry. The representatives of those who have lost their lives at the hands of public bodies face a significant disadvantage in obtaining legal representation on parity with the other interested parties. The inquest is an inquiry into the circumstances and cause of death. The representatives of the deceased are entitled to be represented but there can be no recovery of their legal expenses from their opponent, regardless of the verdict, and there is no public funding available except in exceptional circumstances. Very often the family of the deceased must foot the bill for legal representation. When the other interested party is the police, NHS or other public body, the taxpayer will meet the cost of its legal representation: David v Goliath.</p> <p>Apart from being unfair, the imbalance of representation at inquests can lead to miscarriages of justice, as the first Hillsborough inquests illustrate.

      "bodyText": "Tuesday\u2019s Indiana primary will be one of the last chances for underdog candidates Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders to upset the frontrunners and try to force a contested convention in the Republican and Democratic races for president. Among Republicans, Cruz has gone all out in Indiana in recent weeks, virtually living in the Hoosier State as he tries to upset Donald Trump. The senator from Texas has even taken the unprecedented step of announcing a vice-presidential candidate months away from the convention, picking former rival Carly Fiorina in an attempt to recapture momentum. With the arcane system that Republicans use to determine their nominee, Indiana is vitally important. If Trump wins the 30 delegates that Indiana awards to the winner of the state\u2019s popular vote \u2013 the winner of each of the state\u2019s nine congressional districts receives three delegates apiece \u2013 only a massive upset by Cruz in California could stop Trump from the 1,237 delegates he needs to win on the convention\u2019s first ballot. Recent public polls show Trump with a solid lead over Cruz in the state, and one released by NBC and the Wall Street Journal on Sunday shows the frontrunner with a 15-point lead. \u201cIf we win in Indiana, it\u2019s all over,\u201d Trump promised a crowd on Sunday in Terra Haute, Indiana. \u201cAnd then we can focus on \u2018Crooked Hillary\u2019, please.\u201d Cruz has campaigned doggedly through the state, nonetheless. In a retail stop in Carmel, an Indianapolis suburb, on Monday, his allies besieged a local coffee shop. Fiorina was joined by Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi, as well as Utah senator Mike Lee and Texas congressman Louie Gohmert, who all glad-handed every Indianan they could find in the room. With the Texas senator\u2019s position looking increasingly beleaguered, his wife and Fiorina could be overheard taking jibes at the press as they thanked voters for their prayers on Cruz\u2019s behalf. Gohmert, a longtime supporter, expressed his wonderment that \u201cthe most dishonest man in the race calls the most honest man \u2018Lyin\u2019\u201d. In the meantime, Trump dismissed both Cruz and Ohio governor John Kasich, a third candidate, as \u201cthe leftovers\u201d, and waxed confident that he would be the nominee. The frontrunner also added a new wrinkle to fiery protectionist rhetoric on Sunday, telling a crowd in Fort Wayne: \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to allow China to rape our country.\u201d On the Democratic side, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is hoping for an upset in a state where former secretary of state Hillary Clinton holds a narrow lead. \u201cWe always thought Indiana was a state that would absolutely be willing to listen to this message,\u201d Pete D\u2019Alessandro, a top Sanders operative who is overseeing his efforts in Indiana, told the Guardian, \u201cbecause Nafta and these terrible trade agreements have just devastated the state over the past generation.\u201d Crediting a long active volunteer effort, he expressed confidence that Sanders will do well. However, Sanders\u2019 fundraising has lagged compared to past months: he raised only $26m in April, which was $20m less than his March total. He needs a big win to keep his hopes alive in the late stages of the primary, following big wins for Clinton in New York and other east coast states. Although a win in Indiana for Sanders would likely only make a minimal difference in narrowing Clinton\u2019s massive lead in delegates (without counting the so-called \u201csuperdelegates\u201d, she currently leads Sanders by 327 pledged delegates, more than twice the final gap between her and Obama in 2008), it would give him much-needed momentum as the arithmetic increasingly makes Clinton the prohibitive favorite to be the Democratic nominee.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Harry Kroto, the British Nobel prize-winning chemist who co-discovered a new form of carbon, has died aged 76. Kroto is best known for his role in revealing that carbon can exist in the form of a hollow football-like structure. Named \u201cbuckminsterfullerene\u201d after the similarly shaped domed buildings produced by the American architect Buckminster Fuller, these structures soon became known as \u201cbuckyballs\u201d. Produced by Kroto and his colleagues in 1985 by turning an intense laser pulse on graphite, this new form of carbon was found to be composed of 60 carbon atoms, with later work confirming their suspicion that these atoms were arranged like the corners of the panels of a football, giving 20 hexagon-shaped faces and 12 pentagon shaped faces. The team also discovered that carbon could exist in clusters of other sizes, including a structure made of 70 carbon atoms that was later found to be rugby ball-shaped. The breakthrough won Kroto and his colleagues Richard Smalley and Robert Curl the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1996, and spurred further discoveries by other scientists of a host of carbon structures that have proved promising in myriad applications, from drug delivery to strengthening tennis rackets. As well as his work in chemistry, Kroto was a keen advocate of explaining science to the public. \u201cHe had a lifetime commitment to education and outreach, and he had a little film company called Vega, which produced videos of interviews with scientists,\u201d said Martin Rees, the astronomer royal, who also recalled Kroto\u2019s artistic talent. \u201cIt was very sad to see him in decline in the last couple of years,\u201d he said. Richard Dawkins was also among those paying tribute to Kroto. Writing on his website, he said that Kroto had \u201cthe curiosity of a child\u201d as well as a rebellious spirit. \u201cAmong other things he convinced me that, however alien and strange life elsewhere in the universe might be, we can be confident that it must be carbon based. No other atom has what it takes,\u201d he added. Lesley Yellowlees, former president of the Royal Society of Chemistry and professor of inorganic electrochemistry at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u201cHarry was an inspirational scientist who engaged with experts and non-experts alike. He motivated generations of would-be scientists through his tireless work with schools, clubs, science museums and festivals, both online and in person. \u201cHe was the most approachable of men \u2013 full of entertaining tales about the wonders of the fullerenes but also about the rigours of scientific endeavour and the importance of good training. His enthusiasm and infectious grin will be sorely missed.\u201d Kroto is believed to have died on Saturday, April 30. Responding to the news on Twitter, Prof Brian Cox tweeted: \u201cRIP Harry Kroto \u2013 brilliant scientist and a strong, passionate advocate for science as a vital part of our culture.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Jonathan Freedland (My plea to the left, 30 April) asks us to imagine if a country far away was created for black people and asks if the left would treat it as it does Israel. As a Palestinian I want to tell him that if, instead of a country for Jews, a country for black people or any other group had been created in our homeland without our consent, we would have objected and resisted as Palestinians with the same vigour. If it continued to defy international law and occupy, colonise and murder and make our lives so miserable that we would leave, we would call for its boycott as we do in the case of the real occupier, Israel. And if that occupation had continued for as long as Israel\u2019s has, we would have called supporters of human rights to help us end this occupation, treat Palestinian citizens of that state equally and allow Palestinian refugees to return. As it happens, those are the legitimate demands of the BDS movement called by Palestinian civil society organisations in 2005. Further, had Israel been created in, say, Uganda and not in Palestine, does Freedland or any other supporter of Israel think that Palestinians would have created Fatah or Hamas and sent them to Uganda to attack the Jewish citizens of this entity in Uganda? Even closer to home, Balfour had more right to promise Wales to the Zionists than Palestine \u2013 with my apologies to the Welsh people. Had he done so and had Israel been created in Wales, had Cardiff been occupied and declared the united capital of Israel, and had Swansea been under siege for 10 years because it reacted to Israel\u2019s illegal occupation, would the Welsh have simply accepted this and behaved as a model occupied people? I remind all who are interested in peace in historic Palestine that we Palestinians did not choose our occupiers. They chose Palestine knowing it was not an empty land but one that had a people, my people, the Palestinians that have paid with their land, lives and rights. As we approach the 68th anniversary of our catastrophe or Nakba, our occupiers need to acknowledge the wrong they did to us, apologise and pursue a genuine reconciliation, which may necessitate a very different political arrangement in historic Palestine. Instead they are busy conflating antisemitism with anti-Zionism, thinking this will end the call for Israel to come to its senses.

      "bodyText": "Film-maker David Puttnam has raised concerns that the government is bowing to pressure from vested interests to significantly diminish the BBC. Following newspaper reports over the weekend that the government is preparing to stop the corporation scheduling popular shows such as Strictly Come Dancing against direct competition from other broadcasters, the Puttnam inquiry into public service broadcasting expressed in a statement its concerns about the handling of charter renewal by the culture secretary, John Whittingdale. \u201cWe have been continuously assured by the culture secretary that he wants the BBC to \u2018thrive in the years to come\u2019, but the drip, drip of these leaks suggest the opposite, that the government wants a significantly diminished corporation,\u201d it said. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport denied the suggestion that it aimed to \u201cdetermine either the content or scheduling of programmes\u201d. The reports over the weekend prompted Labour\u2019s shadow culture secretary, Maria Eagle, to accuse Whittingdale of unacceptable interference in the BBC before the publication of a white paper later this month. \u201cThe government needs to resist, and to be seen to resist, any undue pressure from vested interests, whether in the press or in broadcasting,\u201d said a statement from the inquiry. \u201cWe urge the government to drop these and any other punitive and ill-considered proposals, and focus instead on drafting the serious and comprehensive framework for the BBC\u2019s future that the corporation needs, and licence fee payers deserve. \u201cIf there is any truth that the government plans to interfere in the scheduling of popular programmes such as Strictly Come Dancing and Silent Witness, this would represent a unique, unnecessary and wholly inappropriate intervention.\u201d The inquiry welcomed rumoured measures such as the extension of the BBC charter from 10 to 11 years. In response to the weekend reports, a DCMS spokesman said: \u201cThe government will be setting out its plan on the BBC charter in a white paper in May. The secretary of state has made it clear on a number of occasions that the government cannot, and indeed should not, determine either the content or scheduling of programmes.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "This week\u2019s local and devolved elections have inevitably been overshadowed by next month\u2019s EU referendum. Nevertheless, for the first time since the general election, the whole of Britain\u2019s electorate has a chance to make its voice heard on Thursday. From the devolved assemblies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, via mayoral elections in London, Liverpool, Salford and Bristol, through local council elections in much of England, and in police and crime commissioner contests in England and Wales, the ballot boxes beckon. There are even two Commons byelections in Labour seats, one in Sheffield, the other in south Wales. So the first thing to say about all these elections is to urge people to use the opportunity to vote. It is glumly true that local government has never been one of those subjects that get many people out of bed in the morning. It is also true that local government has seen its powers systematically chipped away for decades by centralising governments of every stripe. It is undeniable as well that the election campaign hasn\u2019t felt much like a festival of democracy these past few weeks, even in places like London and Scotland that will trigger the biggest headlines and the largest consequences on Friday. And the existential importance of this week\u2019s voting undeniably pales in comparison with the EU referendum in June. Nevertheless, the May elections matter, because government matters and because the results will reshape the mood in and between the major parties. When the results are counted, most of the immediate focus will of course be on the big contests in Scotland, Wales and London. That priority can certainly be justified. Anything other than wins for the Scottish National party in the Holyrood vote or for Labour in Wales and London would be major shocks with major implications. But the political class ignores the rest of England at its peril. Mainly that\u2019s because of the numbers. Around 16 million people in England\u2019s cities and counties are electing councillors this week. This is more people than have the vote in Scotland, Wales and London put together. But it\u2019s also because, whichever way people vote in Scotland, Wales and London it is the voters in the rest of England \u2014 who between them elect almost two out of every three MPs at Westminster when general elections come around \u2014 who in the end do most to shape the politics of this country. Winning in England isn\u2019t an optional extra for a party that aims to govern Britain. It\u2019s an unavoidable core task to think English. That\u2019s even more true when the SNP have a lock on Scotland. When most of these English council seats were last contested in 2012, in the aftermath of George Osborne\u2019s \u201comnishambles\u201d budget, Labour under Ed Miliband had a successful night. Labour added nearly 500 council seats to its poor 2008 showing in those contests four years ago. It secured 39% of the national equivalent vote share, which projects local election outcomes on to a Britain-wide national canvas. Yet Labour has not come close to repeating that level of success since. Mr Osborne produced another divisive budget this year too. And voter confidence in the government\u2019s economic strategy is lower now than it was in 2012, when many voters still gave them the benefit of the doubt. Logically, this ought therefore to be a bumper election week for the opposition, not least because the Conservatives are also so obsessed by and divided over Europe. But there are few signs that Labour will have a year like 2012 this time. Labour is currently polling around 30% in local byelections, nine points down on four years ago. Forecasts \u2013 made before Labour\u2019s current internal argument about antisemitism \u2013 in fact suggest around 150 Labour seat losses in England, with the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and Ukip all sharing the gains. A relatively good night for the Lib Dems is a possibility this week, though that would not be as significant politically as a relatively good night for the Tories under such difficult circumstances. It is right to await the results before drawing firm conclusions. But results on these lines would justify serious Labour soul-searching. The justification for saying this has nothing directly to do with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. It is simply that, with Labour in continuing eclipse in Scotland, the party\u2019s ability to mount a convincing challenge at the 2020 UK general election will depend more than ever before on having a strategy for making convincing gains in England. Labour needs to be making unambiguous gains in England this week, not just in London, for 2020 to look even remotely competitive.",

Forecasts \u2013 made before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/02/labour-suspends-two-councillors-alleged-antisemitism\" title=\"\">Labour\u2019s current internal argument</a> about antisemitism \u2013 in fact suggest around 150 Labour seat losses in England, with the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and Ukip all sharing the gains. A relatively good night for the Lib Dems is a possibility this week, though that would not be as significant politically as a relatively good night for the Tories under such difficult circumstances.</p> <p>It is right to await the results before drawing firm conclusions. But results on these lines would justify serious Labour soul-searching. The justification for saying this has nothing directly to do with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. It is simply that, with Labour in continuing eclipse in Scotland, the party\u2019s ability to mount a convincing challenge at the 2020 UK general election will depend more than ever before on having a strategy for making convincing gains in England. Labour needs to be making unambiguous gains in England this week, not just in London, for 2020 to look even remotely competitive.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cat owners have been warned of the dangers their feline companions face when venturing outdoors after video emerged of bald eagles feasting on the body of a dead cat near Pittsburgh. Footage from a live web camera mounted at the Hays bald eagle nest, located a few miles from the center of Pittsburgh, showed the eagles serving up the cat to hungry eaglets. Concerned cat owners bombarded the local Audubon Society about why the eagles had preyed upon the cat. \u201cAfter reviewing the footage, we believe that the cat was dead when brought to the nest,\u201d the Audubon Society of western Pennsylvania in a statement. \u201cWhile many may cringe at this, the eagles bring squirrels, rabbits, fish (and other animals) into the nest to eat multiple times each day.\u201d \u201cTo people, the cat represents a pet but to the eagles and to other raptors, the cat is a way to sustain the eaglets and help them to grow. While seeing a cat in the nest was difficult for many, we\u2019re hopeful that people will understand that this is a part of nature, and nature isn\u2019t always kind or pretty.\u201d Eagles aren\u2019t the only threat facing cats. Coyotes are considered one of the most common predators of felines. Coyotes have expanded their range in parts of the US, causing occasional clashes with cats and dogs. In 2009, residents of a Denver suburb decided to scare off problem coyotes using paintball guns. Other threats to cats include snakes, raccoons and porcupines. Katie Lisnik, director of cat protection and policy at the Humane Society, said eagles and owls are the biggest threats to cats. \u201cI live in New England and the fisher [a small carnivorous mammal] can take a cat too,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cWhen cats are outside, they are part of the natural world. The animals that prey upon them don\u2019t think \u2018that\u2019s a pet, it\u2019s different\u2019.\u201d Lisnik said a number of approaches can be taken, such as leashing cats when they taken outside, or keeping them indoors, as Americans have increasingly chosen to do. But it\u2019s worth noting that cats are more often predators than prey. The Audubon Society has urged people to keep cats indoors because the felines kill and eat \u201cmany, many songbirds\u201d. Cats kill an estimated 1.3 billion to four billion birds and an incredible 6.3 billion to 22.3 billion mammals, such as rodents, each year in the US. While the majority of these deaths are caused be free-ranging \u201cferal\u201d cats, rather than pets, separate studies suggest that around a third of all domesticated cats engage in hunting. In Australia, where huge numbers of native animals are threatened by feral cats, several jurisdictions have considered making owners place bells around cats\u2019 necks, in order to warn unsuspecting birds. The Australian government has authorized a mass cull of feral cats, to the dismay of celebrities including French actor Brigitte Bardot and British singer Morrissey, but no such intervention is planned in the US. The Humane Society said that more needs to be done to reduce the number of feral cats, although primarily through trapping and neutering untamed felines. \u201cThere should be an overall goal of fewer unowned cats,\u201d Lisnik said. \u201cCats being harmed isn\u2019t a good thing and nor is killing large numbers of birds and other wildlife.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Even though I have never liked the sound of the N-word, and have only ever personally experienced it in a negative context, I could not have been more moved by Larry Wilmore\u2019s use of the word in his closing remarks as host of the White House Correspondents Dinner on Saturday night. Wilmore said to Barack Obama: \u201cYo Barry, you did it, my n---a,\u201d pounding his chest and going in for the brother-love embrace. Doing so, he broke comedic character to tell the president, to a large extent on behalf of black America, how meaningful it has been for us to have seen him in office for the past eight years. Whether viewers agree or disagree with his policies, as Wilmore noted earlier in his bit \u2013 \u201cI agree with the policy that he\u2019s black\u201d \u2013 the embrace represented a moment filled with the vulnerability, truth and power of two black men seeing each other in an America that devalues, profiles, incarcerates and kills them at a startling rate. I was introduced to the N-word long before I had any real understanding of its association with blackness and black culture. Certainly, when I first heard it from the mouth of a white playground bully in the fourth or fifth grade, I knew it was not meant as a term of endearment. But as a black child adopted into a white family, I had never heard the word and its meaning discussed. It wasn\u2019t until high school, after I\u2019d read James Baldwin and other black writers, interacted with some black kids during summers out of town and listened to hip-hop that I came to realize that it was a word not merely complicated, but intensely fraught. The level of fraughtness is entirely reliant upon who says it and to whom. I understood that in hip-hop culture, and among many black Americans, the N-word is often used playfully, lovingly. Ta-Nehisi Coates told Heben Nigatu and Tracy Clayton of BuzzFeed\u2019s popular podcast Another Round that \u201cn---a\u201d is his favorite word in the English language. But as an adult and the parent of a 10-year-old son, I still don\u2019t use it or want to hear it. The obvious reason is that I never heard it spoken to me lovingly. The only context I know for that word is one in which I am being intentionally degraded by white people. The next time I heard it, after the playground, was in high school, when my boss at the local oil company called me a lazy n---er under his breath after I refused to clean the bathroom right after he\u2019d used it. I was a receptionist, not a cleaning person. I believe the word belongs to black people and black culture \u2013 the agency and right to use it if and when and how we want to use it is important. As much as I support and understand Wilmore\u2019s use of it with Obama, and respect that Ta-Nehisi Coates finds magic in a word many people cringe at, I have been very clear with my son that context matters. When he hears Kendrick Lamar say it, or Larry Wilmore, he knows that it\u2019s their prerogative to use the word, and that they are communicating a very specific, deeply rooted kind of affection toward one another. He also knows that white people are never allowed to use it. While I have been fairly strict with him about his own usage of the word \u2013 not in our house, not with his boys, not even singing along with hip-hop \u2013 the exchange between Wilmore and Obama reminded me of a moment I witnessed and wrote about in an earlier book of mine called Saving the Race, which looks at the legacy of WEB Du Bois in a contemporary context. I was chatting to the journalist LeAlan Jones in New York\u2019s Union Square last year when, when mid-sentence, almost as if it were part of what he was saying to me, LeAlan looked up past my shoulder and said, \u201cHey, Q-Tizzy, what up?\u201d Then, in this one beautiful seamless motion, LeAlan and the man he had just greeted exchanged the graceful palm-to-fingers slide of a familiar handshake. The man kept walking, and LeAlan resumed the sentence where he\u2019d left off with me. A little while later, having recognized the man he\u2019d shaken hands with, I asked him: \u201cSo how do you know Q-Tip?\u201d and LeAlan said: \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s not just a familiar handshake \u2013 it\u2019s a black handshake. It\u2019s the physical embodiment of the word \u201cn---a\u201d and it is ours. At a time of heightened awareness and receptivity regarding race and black culture, it felt like Larry Wilmore was saying: \u201cYou can keep degrading us, keep ignoring or killing us, keep pretending that conversations about race will get us where we need to get, but you cannot take this. Not this word, not this gesture. Not our recognition of each other.\u201d And it made me feel a sense of pride \u2013 a sense of black pride.",

A little while later, having recognized the man he\u2019d shaken hands with, I asked him: \u201cSo how do you know Q-Tip?\u201d and LeAlan said: \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/apr/29/barack-obama-best-jokes-white-house-correspondents-dinners-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4tmnx\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2496718\"            data-video-name=\"White House correspondents\u2019 dinner: Obama\u2019s best zingers \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian/The White House\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5723ded9e4b0f300275c7fde\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/04/29/160429OBAMAFINAL_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11461798&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/04/29/160429OBAMAFINAL_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/04/29/160429OBAMAFINAL_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/04/29/160429OBAMAFINAL.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/apr/29/barack-obama-best-jokes-white-house-correspondents-dinners-video\">Obama\u2019s best zingers from last seven White House dinners</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s not just a familiar handshake \u2013 it\u2019s a black handshake.

Not this word, not this gesture. Not our recognition of each other.\u201d And it made me feel a sense of pride \u2013 a sense of black pride. </p>",

    "webTitle": "Iceland president's wife linked to offshore tax havens in leaked files", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The president of Iceland is expected to come under pressure this week after leaked documents appeared to show that part of his wife\u2019s considerable fortune was held in offshore tax havens. \u00d3lafur Ragnar Gr\u00edmsson, who has been in office for 20 years, last month surprised many by declaring he would stand for re-election again after serving five terms. His decision was prompted by the Panama Papers scandal, which forced Iceland\u2019s prime minister to resign. There was now \u201ca strong demand for stability [and] experience\u201d, said 72-year-old Gr\u00edmsson, who is on course to win a landslide victory according to the polls. A presidential spokesman said Gr\u00edmsson has never had any knowledge of his wife Dorrit Moussaieff\u2019s financial affairs, which her lawyers said have always been conducted legally. Sigmundur Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Gunnlaugsson resigned as prime minister last month, days after the Guardian and other media published details of a secretive investment company called Wintris, based in the British Virgin Islands, which he had owned with his wife. The information was from the Panama Papers, the largest ever data leak to journalists, which was obtained by German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and shared through the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) with the Guardian, the BBC and other media. Gunnlaugsson\u2019s links to Wintris, which he said did not need to be declared on the parliamentary register of financial interests, sparked mass protest in Reykjavik forcing him from office. Just over two weeks later, Gr\u00edmsson \u2013 who praised the expos\u00e9 as \u201ca great public service\u201d and \u201cimportant wake-up call\u201d for politicians \u2013 declared there would be no similar revelations concerning offshore accounts held by him or his wife, a wealthy London jeweller and socialite. \u201cNo. No, no, no, no,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to be the case.\u201d But previously unreported papers \u2013 part of a leak from HSBC\u2019s private bank in Geneva \u2013 show Moussaieff had links to offshore companies and to trusts registered outside the UK. Leaked bank files show Iceland\u2019s first lady listed as one of three Moussaieff family members who jointly owned a company in the British Virgin Islands called Jaywick Properties Inc. She was also a beneficiary of the Moussaieff Sharon Trust, according to the files. In addition, the HSBC files suggest Moussaieff, who is non-domiciled for UK tax purposes, was in line to inherit further portions of her family\u2019s offshore wealth when her 86-year-old mother, Alisa, dies. The Moussiaeff family are best known for running a jewellery shop on New Bond Street, Mayfair, catering to London\u2019s super-rich. Building up the business over generations, they are now among the world\u2019s wealthiest jewellers. According to the Sunday Times\u2019 annual rich list Alisa Moussaieff and her family have a fortune worth an estimated \u00a3200m. Information on her daughter\u2019s financial affairs taken from the HSBC files may well be out of date as the data covers a period of to 2005 to 2007. Asked if she still linked to Jaywick, the Moussaieff Sharon Trust, or any other aspect of the family\u2019s offshore holdings, her lawyers declined to comment. They said her business interests were always carried out legally and they were a private matter. Moussaieff\u2019s lawyers also said that she and Gr\u00edmsson conducted their business affairs separately from one another and did not therefore know anything about each other\u2019s financial circumstances. Asked about the first lady\u2019s offshore interests, a spokesman for the president said: \u201c[Gr\u00edmsson] has no knowledge of [them] nor has he ever heard of them.\u201d He added: \u201cPresident Gr\u00edmsson does not have, nor has he at any time had, any information about the financial affairs of his wife or other members of the Moussaieff family.\u201d In the run-up to Iceland\u2019s presidential election next month Gr\u00edmsson has spoken out against the use of complex offshore structures. \u201cI think one of the reasons people came out on the street was \u2026 moral disgust,\u201d he said. \u201cWe now live in a very open and transparent world. And everybody has to be accountable to the people in a way that people can for themselves see.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nearly every school in Detroit closed on Monday after the teacher\u2019s union called on members to take a sick day because the district will not be able to pay teachers in the summer unless a funding crisis is resolved. More than 45,600 students missed school on Monday after teachers responded to the union\u2019s call, forcing the closure of 94 of the 97 schools in the district. A few hundred teachers picketed outside the district headquarters. The Detroit school district, which is estimated to have more than $3bn in debt, said on Saturday it could not pay teachers past 30 June. So without additional funding, teachers who had chosen to be paid throughout the year, instead of just when school is in session, would not receive money they had already earned. Detroit Federation of Teachers interim president Ivy Bailey said the union organized the sickout because the district had broken its deal to pay teachers. \u201cTeachers want to be in the classroom giving children a chance to learn and reach their potential,\u201d Bailey said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, by refusing to guarantee that we will be paid for our work, DPS [Detroit public schools] is effectively locking our members out of the classrooms.\u201d Bailey did not say whether the sickouts would continue past Monday, though the union has an emergency meeting planned for Tuesday night. The union\u2019s executive vice-president, Terrence Martin, told the Detroit Free Press that it would hold a voice vote at the meeting \u201cto authorize a major collective action\u201d, in addition to holding ballot votes in schools later that week. Under Michigan law, government employees like teachers are not allowed to strike. The state attorney general, however, chose not to take action against union members following a similar sickout in January over poor school conditions, which labor experts said could be considered a method of strike. Though most school districts in the US are run by local governments, Detroit\u2019s financial difficulties led the state to take control of the district in 2009. Since then, a rotating cast of emergency managers have been tasked to head the district\u2019s recovery. Former bankruptcy judge Steven Rhodes, who took over the position in March, said he understood the teacher\u2019s frustrations but thought the union\u2019s decision was \u201ccounterproductive and detrimental\u201d. \u201cI am, however, confident that the legislature will support the request that will guarantee that teachers will receive the pay that is owed to them,\u201d Rhodes said in a statement. \u201cThe DFT\u2019s choice for a drastic call to action was not necessary.\u201d The state legislature is considering a $720m restructuring plan to pay off the school\u2019s debts. The state senate approved the deal in March, but it\u2019s waiting for approval from the state house and the governor, Rick Snyder. In March, Snyder approved a bill to use $48.7m to keep the school district operating until 30 June. In response to Monday\u2019s sickout, Snyder said: \u201cThat\u2019s not a constructive act with respect to getting legislation through.\u201d Detroit mayor Mike Duggan had not commented on this sickout as of Monday afternoon, though after January\u2019s union action, he said there was \u201cno question about the legitimacy of the issues they\u2019re raising\u201d, after touring schools where he saw a dead mouse and children wearing coats to stay warm in class.",

      "bodyText": "The trade union bill, which the government advertised as its flagship at the start of the parliamentary session that ends next week, has been heavily amended. But it is still a nasty, vindictive piece of legislation. There is no justification for it beyond a partisan desire to weaken trade unions, and indirectly to weaken the Labour party, to the point where it becomes almost impossible for workers to defend their rights. The intent of the bill sits uneasily with the jointly authored Guardian article last Thursday in which David Cameron and the former TUC general secretary Sir Brendan Barber appealed for a remain vote in the EU referendum partly in order to shore up protections for workers, many of which rest on European legislation. Many of the bill\u2019s proposals are high on the agenda of the neoliberal Brexiteers. Last week, the leave campaigner Bernard Jenkin complained that the concessions were an unprincipled sale of government policy just to buy the left\u2019s more active support for remain. Certainly, the TUC was open about prioritising the fight against the legislation rather than for the remain campaign. As early as January, concessions were being trailed to a cross-party coalition of peers, some of whom held no brief for trade unions except as an important part of civil society. This alliance of the unelected has fought hard but with only partial success to preserve the trade unions\u2019 role in the processes of democracy. It has defeated the attempt to stop employers processing union dues \u2013 which is entirely voluntary \u2013 which could have cost some unions millions in lost subs as they re-recruited their members and set up alternative ways of collecting their dues. That would have had a knock-on impact on the amount of cash unions could donate to Labour, but not nearly as much of an impact as making members opt in rather than out of the political levy. That will now apply only to new recruits, and will be phased in. The worst of the draconian rules on picketing, which the Conservative MP David Davis suggested would not have been out of place in Franco\u2019s Spain, have also been dropped. But the bill still includes clauses demanding that pickets have an identifiable and authorised supervisor. The double strike threshold in essential public services, a category that includes teachers, energy workers and border security, remains, imposing a turnout of 50% and then a \u201cyes\u201d vote of at least 40% of all eligible voters. The bill\u2019s critics still want more concessions on e-balloting \u2013 something Tories deemed too vulnerable to fraud for unions, but used to select Zac Goldsmith as their candidate for London mayor \u2013 and on the right to take time in the week for union work. This bill is unprincipled, unfair and unjustified. Fewer days than ever are lost to industrial action. Trade unions do not just protect and promote rights at work, but in an increasingly disconnected world offer a route into political engagement. In the absence of a negotiated agreement on party funding, their contribution to Labour funds is essential if there is to be anything like equality of arms between the two major parties. David Cameron has sometimes claimed that the Tories are the real party of the workers. The proposals in the trade union bill show just how remote this claim is from what most working lives actually involve \u2013 and how casually he is prepared to disregard one of the very foundations of democracy.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn will seek to seize back the initiative on Tuesday in Labour\u2019s battle to hold on to key council seats at Thursday\u2019s local elections, after the party was forced to suspend three councillors in a continuing row about antisemitism. On Friday Corbyn announced an independent review of claims of antisemitism within the Labour party, in the hope of drawing a line under accusations from some MPs that he had failed to respond forcefully enough to the issue. Three councillors were suspended on Monday after evidence emerged that they had used social media to promote what appeared to be antisemitic views. The former mayor of Blackburn, Salim Mulla, who is now a councillor, had shared social media posts last August that appeared to draw a link between Zionism and Islamic State. Below photographs with slogans suggesting that support for Palestinians from France and Japan had triggered attacks by Isis, he said: \u201cIs this a coincidence. You [sic] bloody daam [sic] right it is. We all know Zionism game being played. It\u2019s bloody obvious who is manupulating[sic] this. Those who are not sure. ISRAEL.\u201d Separately, Nottingham city councillor Ilyas Aziz was found to have shared a post suggesting that Israel should be relocated to the US \u2013 the same one that resulted in the Bradford West MP, Naz Shah, being suspended last week despite making a series of public apologies. Aziz also posted a link to an article about Nazi Germany, alongside which he said: \u201cA reminder of the treatment and suffering of Jews in Nazi Germany. Are there any similarities to how Israel is treating Palestinians?\u201d Later on Monday a third man, Burnley councillor Shah Hussain, was suspended, after it emerged that he had told an Israeli footballer on Twitter in 2014, \u201cyou and your country\u201d are \u201cdoing exactly the same thing\u201d that Hitler did, in reference to the violence against Palestinians. A Labour spokesperson confirmed that all three had been suspended pending an investigation. It emerged on Monday night that an unknown number of other Labour members have also been suspended while the party\u2019s compliance committee investigates accusations of antisemitism against them. A party source admitted there were more cases under review that had not yet been made public, but said reports that the figure was as high as 50 were \u201ca wild overestimate\u201d. The source said: \u201cWhile we do not give a running commentary on numbers suspended, the majority of the Labour party\u2019s suspensions for antisemitism are in the public domain. Labour takes antisemitism very seriously and that\u2019s why Jeremy has set out a robust plan to tackle the issue.\u201d With the latest polls suggesting Labour is heading for its worst performance in local elections since 1982, and could lose up to 175 council seats, Corbyn\u2019s team are keen to turn attention away from the issue of antisemitism and focus on campaigning. Labour launched a minimalist new poster Monday night, with the slogan: \u201cElections are about taking sides: Labour is on yours.\u201d A former director of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, was drafted in to chair a review of the Labour party after a series of incidents that culminated in an embarrassing public spat between Ken Livingstone, former London mayor, and John Mann MP. Livingstone defended Shah in radio and TV interviews but in doing so drew links between Zionism and Hitler. He has insisted that he will contest the grounds for his suspension when his case is reviewed by Labour\u2019s national executive committee. The dispute was given fresh impetus over the weekend when Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the Unite union, claimed that the row over Corbyn\u2019s response to antisemitic incidents was the latest crisis manufactured by \u201ctreacherous\u201d Labour MPs keen to undermine the leader. Corbyn\u2019s team insists there has been no surge in antisemitic incidents since he became party leader last year; but centrist MPs are warning that some Labour leftwingers slide too easily from staunch support for the Palestinians, to making slurs against Israel. Asked whether Labour has a problem with antisemitism, Corbyn told the Mirror: \u201cNo, there is not a huge problem. What there is is a very small number of people that have said things that they should not have done. We have therefore said they will be suspended and investigated.\u201d However, the shadow education secretary Lucy Powell said on Monday that there was \u201cclearly\u201d an issue with antisemitism \u201cotherwise we would not have spent the last six or seven days talking about it\u201d. Asked on Channel 4 news if Livingstone should be expelled from the party, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s very, very difficult to see a circumstance where his suspension would be lifted and he would be readmitted.\u201d One backbench MP critical of Corbyn said local councillors in his constituency have been \u201chead in hands\u201d over the party\u2019s travails nationally, which they fear could lose them their seats on Thursday. However, even those Labour MPs most sceptical of the leadership say they do not expect any challenger to move against him until after June\u2019s EU referendum \u2013 and they are conscious that he retains overwhelming support among grassroots members. Meanwhile Corbyn\u2019s closest lieutenant \u2013 the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell \u2013 has publicly denied claims that he is readying himself to take over if Corbyn is unseated in a putsch, tweeting: \u201cMedia &amp; right wing dirty tricks &amp; lies trying to divide me and Jeremy. They should know it only unites us even more &amp; makes us stronger.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An attempt by the New Hampshire Republican party to limit Donald Trump\u2019s influence in a potential contested convention was halted Monday, when the state chair canceled a controversial online vote for positions on crucial committees just minutes after the voting deadline. In an email obtained by the Guardian, party chair Jennifer Horn said that although all 23 of the state\u2019s delegates to the Republican National Convention participated in the vote, she was canceling it \u201cin the interest of full transparency\u201d. Instead, she summoned a delegates-only meeting in Concord on Friday, in which those unable to attend could participate via conference call. Initially, in an email sent out Saturday night, the state party\u2019s executive director proposed a slate for the eight slots on convention committees reserved for New Hampshire delegates at the Republican gathering in Cleveland in July. The proposed slate included two supporters apiece of John Kasich, Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz and one supporter of Marco Rubio. The eighth slot was left vacant. Trump won overwhelmingly in the Granite State\u2019s February primary, with 35% of the vote. His nearest competitor, John Kasich, only received 15% in what was then the first primary in the country. Under New Hampshire\u2019s relatively proportional rules, by which any candidate who gets more than 10% of the vote receives delegates, Trump was awarded 11 of the state\u2019s 23 delegates. Since then, the well-organized Cruz campaign has picked up stray delegates in other states that Trump won, such as Louisiana, and swept local contests in Wyoming and Colorado. In contrast, Trump\u2019s campaign spent weeks in disarray, its manager charged with battery against a reporter and ballot errors common at the local level. The businessman brought on a veteran of backroom politics, Paul Manafort, to take over his campaign\u2019s efforts to secure the 1,237 delegates needed for the nomination. His campaign has struggled in states where the process of delegate selection is not determined by the results of the primary election, but in New Hampshire delegates are chosen directly by campaigns. However, even without changing the composition of the delegates, who sits on convention committees can still have a major effect on who wins the nomination. The rules committee, in particular, is very important to the campaigns this year. Many delegates are bound to Trump on the first ballot by party rules, which oblige them to vote according to the results of their state\u2019s primary. But on the second, third and subsequent ballots, more and more delegates are free to vote their conscience. In theory, a rules committee made up of party members hostile to Trump could change this rule \u2013 and put the nomination up for grabs. Jennifer Horn, the chair of the New Hampshire GOP, has long been a critic of Trump. She condemned Trump as \u201cun-American\u201d after his call for a ban on Muslims entering the US in December. She did not respond to requests for comment on Monday but told the Guardian on Saturday that the committee election process was \u201cnot something I am going to discuss with the press until it\u2019s totally closed\u201d. A well connected Trump ally in New Hampshire used the episode to call the state GOP\u2019s leadership into question \u201cher ability to run a fair election\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that Jennifer Horn has been a disastrous state party chair, exceptionally critical of Donald Trump,\u201d said the supporter, who asked for anonymity. \u201cThis [was] an attempt to circumvent the will of the voters when Donald Trump won the state by 20 points and received 11 delegates,\u201d they said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Racing\u2019s ruling body has defended its decision to ban the trainer Paul Gilligan, despite the clear possibility that his case may have to be reheard. The disciplinary panel in the case was chaired by Matthew Lohn, a solicitor whose independent status has been challenged in a separate case involving the trainer Jim Best which will come before an appeal panel in three weeks\u2019 time. The disciplinary panel that heard Best\u2019s case was also chaired by Lohn, after which it emerged that Fieldfisher, the firm in which Lohn is senior partner, has in the recent past been paid by the British Horseracing Authority for advice on non-disciplinary matters. Best\u2019s lawyers have appealed on several grounds, one of them based on the assertion that Lohn should not have been on a panel that is supposed to be independent of the BHA. That line of appeal is now open to Gilligan and, indeed, anyone else found guilty in recent months by a BHA panel which featured Lohn as a member. Gilligan has told The Guardian that he will pursue an appeal on that ground, adding that he also denies the substance of the charge against him, which was that he ran a horse in a British race after running it at an unrecognised \u2018flapping\u2019 race-meeting in Ireland. The BHA\u2019s panel found Gilligan guilty of the charge in March but took more than a month to issue its decision on penalty, which turned out to be a six-month ban that was announced on Friday and came into immediate effect. The BHA asked for the ban to be reciprocated in Ireland, where Gilligan is based, but the Irish Turf Club has now refused to consider that request until Gilligan\u2019s appeal is heard, so the trainer can continue to have runners in Ireland. Asked whether it might not have been better for the BHA to postpone publication of Gilligan\u2019s penalty until the Best appeal had been heard, a BHA spokesman said he could see no good reason for further delay. \u201cThe hearing involving Paul Gilligan was held in March and the Panel found on the day that he was in breach of the rules, with his penalty and reasons to follow in due course,\u201d Robin Mounsey said. \u201cOnce that penalty had been decided on and the reasons written, it would not have been appropriate to hold them back until after the outcome of the Jim Best appeal in late May.\u201d The BHA intends to mount a vigorous defence when Best\u2019s appeal is heard on 24 May. Its chief executive, Nick Rust, indicated during a recent appearance on At The Races that the body does not believe its status as a client of Lohn\u2019s firm should void the conclusions of any panel on which he sat. Privately, however, officials are at least prepared to contemplate the possibility of having to rehear the matter in front of a different panel. From the regulator\u2019s perspective that would be embarrassing but clearly preferable to one of the alternatives for which Best\u2019s lawyers are expected to argue, that there is now no prospect of a fair hearing and therefore the proceedings must be abandoned. Lohn has not spoken in public about the issue and has not responded to The Guardian\u2019s requests for comment. Adam Brickell, the BHA\u2019s director of integrity, has said nothing in public since a brief defence of the disciplinary system a month ago, when he pointed out that it had withstood previous legal scrutiny. Anthony Boswood QC, who will chair the independent appeal board in the Best case, hinted at the gravity of the matter when he ruled recently that Best could continue to train before the appeal. \u201cThis causes me very great concern,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA partner in a solicitors\u2019 firm acts as chairman of a supposedly independent judicial inquiry into allegations of misconduct made by a regulatory body against a person when, unknown to the person accused, the regulatory body is itself a client of the chairman and his firm. \u201cThis situation seems to me to cry out for further consideration in the light of the English authorities and the rules which apply in what may be analogous situations, for example, arbitration.\u201d Boswood recorded an admission by Graeme McPherson QC, representing the BHA, \u201cthat the BHA was indeed a client of the chairman of the disciplinary panel, and his firm, in that they had acted on the BHA\u2019s behalf, in the recent past, in giving advice and/or undertaking work\u201d. The BHA\u2019s rules do not specify qualifications for membership of disciplinary panels. However its press releases habitually refer to such panels as being independent of the BHA.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After the last-ever circus to feature elephants, capping 145 years of elephant shows and decades of pressure from animal activists, two professional clowns walked into a bar to reflect on the state of the circus industry. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of an era,\u201d said Crickett McGrath, sipping a gin and tonic. \u201cIt\u2019s older than baseball.\u201d \u201cAnd Coca-Cola,\u201d added Anthony Hoang. Feld Entertainment, the production company behind Ringling Bros and Barnum and Bailey Circus, has retired its elephant herd and discontinued the act. Sunday evening\u2019s show in Providence, Rhode Island, was a formal farewell to the practice that McGrath called \u201cthe hooks on which a circus is hung\u201d, paraphrasing PT Barnum. Feld is retiring eleven animals in total, after five others performed their final show in Pennsylvania on Sunday. In Providence, Kellyann, a four-ton Asian elephant renowned for amusing her fellow entertainers with rude noises by pressing her foot to her trunk and emitting air, took her final bow along with five other females. The elephants stood on their hind legs, feigned sleep and spun on circular podiums, shorter than the elephants are wide, dancing to choruses of \u201cThis is the greatest show on earth!\u201d Feld Entertainment has fought lawsuits against animal rights groups in the past. In 2014, it won a $16m settlement, and in 2011 the USDA fined it $270,000 for Animal Welfare Act violations after Mother Jones reported the elephants spent most of their lives chained, were often whipped with bullhooks, and were left in cages full of feces. None of the efforts of animal rights groups appeared to have any direct impact on the circus until last year, when local governments began taking action. Los Angeles and Oakland both banned the use of bullhooks, short hooked poles used to train and instruct elephants; and Asheville, North Carolina, banned performing elephants at the 7,600-seat US Cellular Center. The bans put limitations on the circus\u2019s ability to tour. In an interview on the Ringling Bros elephant conservation website, Kenneth Feld, the company\u2019s CEO, also cited a shift in the public\u2019s attitude toward touring wild animals. Earlier this year, SeaWorld banned the breeding of captive orcas. The company\u2019s response to criticism seemed to be written into the show script Sunday night. \u201cWe have the healthiest, happiest and most physically fit herd in the world!\u201d boomed ringmaster Johnathan Lee Iverson, as a half dozen female elephants strolled into the arena in a neat line, trunk grasping tail. The audience burst into applause, peppered with the excited screams of children, twirling an assortment of plastic light-up toys. Dropping the elephant act and moving the animals to the Ringling Brothers Center for Elephant Conservation in Florida is not an admission of guilt, said Feld spokesman Stephen Payne, who insists that nothing about the training or the touring process is abusive. \u201cYou cannot make 9,000lbs do what 9,000lbs doesn\u2019t want to do,\u201d said Payne. Answering concerns that the elephants are taken away from their mothers too young and spend much of their lives in chains, Payne said they were separated at around two to three years old and were tethered only at night, \u201cso they don\u2019t disturb each other\u201d. Elizabeth Hogan, US wildlife campaign manager at World Animal Protection, welcomes the change from the household circus name. \u201cIt is a victory, certainly, for the elephants,\u201d she said, adding that there is a \u201cgrowing awareness\u201d among the general public about animal rights issues. Still, she is still concerned about other wild animals featured in the circus as well, such as lions, tigers and a kangaroo. The history of the mistreatment of elephants is as long as the history of the circus itself. One called Jumbo was known to be fed large quantities of alcohol by his trainer, and was hit by a train. After his death, Barnum proceeded to take the beast\u2019s skeleton on tour. Elephants are not normally afraid of rodents in the wild, but circus elephants such as Jumbo were often kept in rat-infested stalls, and were gnawed on by the beasts. Meanwhile, Ringling Bros faces the challenge of coming up with a new act as popular as the elephants. Circus aficionado Ernest Albrecht said taking elephants out of the show would cause irreparable damage to the event. \u201cElephants in the circus in America have always been just about the most important ingredient; it was the way a circus was measured, and if it [didn\u2019t] have any elephants, it wasn\u2019t considered much of a circus,\u201d said Albrecht. Several children at the Providence show reported having no interest in attending the show without elephants. \u201cI hear elephants are endangered,\u201d said Rama Colley, seven, who had seen Peta protesters outside the arena. John De Leonardo, a Peta employee, said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue protesting until all the animals are out of the circus.\u201d He held a model elephant bullhook and a sign that read \u201cElephants are beaten\u201d alongside a dozen other protesters outside the arena. De Leonardo has no faith in the wellbeing of elephants at the Ringling Bros-run Center for Elephant Conservation in Florida. \u201cIf they are calling it a sanctuary, it\u2019s like calling a puppy mill a dog rescue,\u201d he said. Payne maintained animal activists have no first-hand knowledge about the Center for Elephant Conservation. He said the circus would evolve with new traditions, including a new ice-skating feature.",

The elephants stood on their hind legs, feigned sleep and spun on circular podiums, shorter than the elephants are wide, dancing to choruses of \u201cThis is the greatest show on earth!\u201d</p> <p>Feld Entertainment has fought lawsuits against animal rights groups in the past.

Los Angeles and Oakland both banned the use of bullhooks, short hooked poles used to train and instruct elephants; and Asheville, North Carolina, banned performing elephants at the 7,600-seat US Cellular Center.</p> <p>The bans put limitations on the circus\u2019s ability to tour. In an interview on the Ringling Bros elephant conservation <a href=\"https://www.ringlingelephantcenter.com/ringling-bros-commitment/\">website</a>, Kenneth Feld, the company\u2019s CEO, also cited a shift in the public\u2019s attitude toward touring wild animals. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/03/17/470720804/seaworld-agrees-to-end-captive-breeding-of-killer-whales\">Earlier this year,</a> SeaWorld banned the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/17/seaworld-to-stop-breeding-killer-whales-orcas-blackfish\">breeding of captive orcas</a>.</p> <p>The company\u2019s response to criticism seemed to be written into the show script Sunday night. \u201cWe have the healthiest, happiest and most physically fit herd in the world!\u201d boomed ringmaster Johnathan Lee Iverson, as a half dozen female elephants strolled into the arena in a neat line, trunk grasping tail.</p> <p>The audience burst into applause, peppered with the excited screams of children, twirling an assortment of plastic light-up toys.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20a4c9fbb9e91f6f66ef3de2f8a48f675ae037e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20a4c9fbb9e91f6f66ef3de2f8a48f675ae037e0/0_36_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Senior elephant handler Alex Petrov interacts with the elephants after they appeared in their final show in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senior elephant handler Alex Petrov interacts with the elephants after they appeared in their final show in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Kelly/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dropping the elephant act and moving the animals to the Ringling Brothers Center for Elephant Conservation in Florida is not an admission of guilt, said Feld spokesman Stephen Payne, who insists that nothing about the training or the touring process is abusive. \u201cYou cannot make 9,000lbs do what 9,000lbs doesn\u2019t want to do,\u201d said Payne.</p> <p>Answering concerns that the elephants are taken away from their mothers too young and spend much of their lives in chains, Payne said they were separated at around two to three years old and were tethered only at night, \u201cso they don\u2019t disturb each other\u201d.</p> <p>Elizabeth Hogan, US wildlife campaign manager at World Animal Protection, welcomes the change from the household circus name. \u201cIt is a victory, certainly, for the elephants,\u201d she said, adding that there is a \u201cgrowing awareness\u201d among the general public about animal rights issues.</p> <p>Still, she is still concerned about other wild animals featured in the circus as well, such as lions, tigers and a kangaroo. </p> <p>The history of the mistreatment of elephants is as long as the history of the circus itself.

The Mercedes driver and reigning champion, who finished second in the Russian Grand Prix, was given his second reprimand of the season after qualifying and will face a 10-place grid penalty should he receive a third. \u201cI\u2019m just aware there\u2019s most likely going to be one 10-place grid penalty because I\u2019ve got one more reprimand to go,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last one was bloody ridiculous.\u201d Hamilton was censured in Sochi for going wide at turn two during qualifying and not, as required, heading to the left to go round a bollard, to ensure no time advantage was gained. The other reprimand came in Bahrain for reversing in the pit lane. In both cases the stewards were following the rules to the letter but Hamilton can feel legitimately aggrieved to an extent. In Sochi he gained no advantage from cutting the corner. In Bahrain, where he could have faced a stronger sanction, he had taken pole and had entered the pit lane to park up but was given no clear instruction where to go, stopped and then reversed for approximately 50cm. Hamilton felt the decisions were unnecessarily harsh. \u201cWhen I was in karting there was one steward who was just there to make everyone\u2019s weekend a bad weekend,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m starting to have reminiscent experiences. Families would turn up and spend so much money to be there but there was this one guy who was a complete arsehole. I heard he\u2019s still there. He was just there to ruin people\u2019s weekend. I have started to see signs of him.\u201d He said both reprimands had triggered this memory. There was one common denominator on both steward panels: Paul Gutjahr, president of the FIA hill climb commission. In Bahrain he was joined by Roger Peart, president of the FIA circuits commission, and the driver representative, Derek Warwick. In Sochi Nish Shetty, an FIA steward, and the former Le Mans winner Emanuele Pirro were the other representatives. Hamilton has not won a race since October, when he took his third world title in Texas, while his team-mate Nico Rosberg has started the season with four straight victories and leads the championship by 43 points. The German has also had a reliable car whereas Hamilton had to start from the back in China after a power unit failure in qualifying. In Russia another failure meant Hamilton missed the final phase of qualifying. Mercedes had to fly out parts overnight to ensure he did not start from the pit lane. Ferrari\u2019s team principal, Maurizio Arrivabene, has admitted his driver Sebastian Vettel went \u201cballistic\u201d during Sunday\u2019s race in which he was shunted out by Red Bull\u2019s Daniil Kvyat on the first lap. The Ferrari driver launched an expletive-laden tirade over team radio and then had words with his former, and Kvyat\u2019s current, team principal, Christian Horner, on the pit wall during the race. \u201cHe was not happy at all, he was going ballistic,\u201d Arrivabene said. \u201cHe has taken a DNF for a second time [after failing to start the race in Bahrain] for something that has nothing to do with him. This is the character of a guy who is a four-times world champion who wants to win, so it\u2019s understandable. Afterwards we talked and he was a bit more calm but of course calm does not mean happy.\u201d Vettel and Kvyat also came together at the Chinese Grand Prix when Vettel was angry with the Russian for putting a move up the inside of turn one that caused him to turn into his Ferrari team-mate, Kimi Raikkonen. Arrivabene had accepted Kvyat\u2019s legitimate move on that occasion but had no sympathy for the 22-year-old\u2019s actions in Sochi. \u201cLast time, in China, I was not complaining about Kvyat and I said he has done his job,\u201d he said. \u201cThis time I can\u2019t find any reason for what has happened.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Its high street stores are meccas of overpriced tat with piles of cuddly Nemo fishes, plastic lightsabres and polyester princess outfits that send girls into a frenzy. With recent cartoon blockbusters such as Frozen, Disney has tightened its hold over children\u2019s hearts but now it is targeting their parents too, by pitching a clothing and homeware empire aimed squarely at adults. \u201cWe did a lot of consumer research and discovered there was huge demand for adult product from Disney,\u201d said Francesca Gianesin, who heads up fashion and lifestyle for the Europe, Middle East and Asia region for Disney Consumer Products. \u201cWhen we see a movie, the first thing we think is will there be an emotional connection? What is it men and women would like to feel by wearing pieces of that movie?\u201d The division is already enjoying a strong run, with sales up 13% to $4.5bn (\u00a33bn) last year as cinema-goers snapped up Frozen, Avengers and Star Wars-related T-shirts, toys and lunch boxes. But the target audience is not the fancy dress party goer \u2013 at the clothing and homeware event Disney held at Somerset House last week there wasn\u2019t a pair of Mickey Mouse-style suspender shorts or a Cinderella costume with battery-operated lights in sight. Gianesin is wearing a Fausto Puglisi tunic inspired by the Captain America franchise, and is channelling superhero rather than Disney princess. \u201cIt\u2019s about empowerment because I\u2019m a superhero,\u201d the Italian explained. \u201cI\u2019m wearing Captain America and I\u2019m a woman, and I want to be seen as strong.\u201d More than 1,000 fashion industry professionals trooped to the event at Somerset House, a glamorous neoclassical building on the Strand in central London, which with its cobbled square and dancing fountains is often a hangout during London fashion week. In an industry always hungry for new ideas, Disney serves up a huge archive for fashion folk to plunder: from the drawings that were the genesis of classic 1930s and 1940s animations such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia and Bambi to storyboards and props from the most recent Marvel films. Enthusiasm for the event was underlined by key figures such as Sandra Choi, creative director of Jimmy Choo, and Geoffroy de La Bourdonnaye, president of Chlo\u00e9, taking part in a panel debate on the \u201cpower of storytelling\u201d. It is only the second time Disney has courted the fashion industry in this way, with last year\u2019s show based on mock-ups created by Disney designers. This year several galleries were packed with the Disney-inspired output of high-end clothing designers ranging from Preen to Anya Hindmarch and Marc Jacobs as well as more accessible fashions such as a \u00a3145 pair of tiger-print Reebok trainers, inspired by its Jungle Book remake. Disney grants character licences for use on everything from toys to clothing and food, earning royalties on the wholesale or retail price. Its hottest properties include Frozen, Mickey and Minnie, Marvel\u2019s The Avengers and Spider-Man \u2013 and, lest we forget, the Disney Princesses. The broad appeal of Disney is clear: its own stores sell a pair of Cinderella \u201clight up\u201d shoe for \u00a316, while a bespoke pair, decorated with thousands of Swarovski crystals, can be ordered from Jimmy Choo for just under \u00a33,000. Gianesin has reorganised her staff to create a Disney Living team, signalling an ambition to conquer the fragmented homewares market, with its characters ripe for use on everything from cushions to crockery and tea towels. Walt Disney logged the colours used to paint each character in its now classic animations, handing the company a paintbox filled with shades such as \u201cScat cat\u201d purple (from The Aristocats) and \u201cshine on ice\u201d from Bambi. Lorna Hall, head of market intelligence at trend forecaster WGSN, said demand for \u201cnovelty and nostalgia done well\u201d should not be underestimated. \u201cThere is a constant need for newness and storytelling in a fashion market that is quite stagnant at the moment,\u201d she explained. \u201cDisney is an iconic brand and part of the story of how we have grown up. There are lots of stories for brands to play with.\u201d With a market value of $170bn, Walt Disney\u2019s other interests include TV channels as well as the famous theme parks and film studios. Its arsenal of film rights was boosted by the purchase of Lucasfilm, the company behind Star Wars, in 2012, having swallowed Pixar, the animation firm behind Toy Story, and Marvel Comics in the 2000s. \u201cWhether you have children or not, it\u2019s all about the emotional connection,\u201d added Gianesin. \u201cLuxury brands create new trends that move through the pyramid from luxury to trend-market to mid-market to mass market, even discount. We are part of pop culture. There are so many properties and characters that are timeless and relevant to different consumers.\u201d",

    "sectionName": "US news", 
    "webTitle": "Sexual harassment training may have reverse effect, research suggests", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sexual harassment courses aimed at preventing workplace discrimination can have the opposite effect, making men less capable of perceiving inappropriate behavior and more likely to blame victims, according to academic studies that cast doubt on traditional training programs. One researcher who has questioned the effectiveness of harassment prevention classes is Lauren Edelman, a professor of law and sociology at the University of California Berkeley, the prestigious school that has been at the center of a series of high-profile faculty misconduct scandals in recent months. \u201cSexual harassment training may, in fact, make it less likely that males will recognize situations that are harassing,\u201d said Edelman, a faculty member in the renowned UC Berkeley law school, where Sujit Choudhry resigned as dean after he was found to have sexually harassed his executive assistant. \u201cSexual harassment training may provoke backlash in males.\u201d Studies testing the effects of harassment training are very limited, but some research has suggested counterintuitive and troubling consequences \u2013 that after men complete trainings, they may be more inclined to brush aside allegations and discount victims. Some researchers believe trainings have no positive effects, tend to be more about legal cover than meaningful prevention or may even have unintended negative consequences \u2013 raising serious concerns about the way colleges and companies heavily focus on training as a solution to harassment. One Journal of Applied Behavioral Science study that evaluated a sexual harassment program for university employees found that men who participated in the training were \u201csignificantly less likely\u201d to consider coercive behaviors toward a subordinate or student as sexual harassment compared with a control group of men who hadn\u2019t done the training. Men who completed the 30-minute training \u2013 during which officials discussed actions that constitute harassment, the harms of harassment, the importance of reporting and possible discipline \u2013 were also significantly less likely to report harassment. The men\u2019s surprising responses may have been an \u201ceffort at self-preservation intended to defend and protect against a perceived attack on them\u201d, the authors wrote. In other words, the training appears to make some men feel threatened and afraid that they will be subject to false accusations, said Shereen Bingham, co-author of the study and professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha school of communication. As a result, they may respond in a defensive manner. \u201cWe were surprised \u2026 it certainly appears to be irrational,\u201d said Bingham. \u201cThe only explanation can be psychological or emotional.\u201d The findings highlight a broader challenge \u2013 that men in leadership roles sometimes struggle to relate to the experiences of those who have faced harassment, she said: \u201cPeople in powerful positions don\u2019t have a good grasp of what it\u2019s like to be in a non-dominant group.\u201d Other studies have shown that when workplaces actively inform men of sexual harassment policies, it can also have unintended negative effects. A study published in the Social Psychology Quarterly found that after men learned about harassment rules, it triggered implicit gender biases, effectively making it more likely for them to stereotype women. \u201cThe purpose of sexual harassment policy is to make men and women more equal in the workplace,\u201d said Justine Tinkler, assistant professor of sociology at the University of Georgia and co-author of the study. \u201cIf the policies are sort of activating gender stereotypes rather than challenging them, they may not be promoting that broader goal.\u201d Tinkler has also studied how sexual harassment trainings can provoke backlash and how people who say they support harassment laws are resistant to the enforcement of those policies. Trainings can also reinforce men\u2019s feelings that women are \u201cemotional and duplicitous in the way that they both want sexual attention, but don\u2019t want sexual harassment\u201d, she explained. Edelman, the UC Berkeley professor, said she suspects the backlash could stem from the \u201ccartoonish, somewhat unrealistic\u201d harassment examples that trainings often include \u2013 lessons that can make participants skeptical and resentful. Edelman\u2019s own research has focused on what\u2019s known as \u201csymbolic compliance\u201d, which refers to the way organizations\u2019 anti-harassment and diversity policies and procedures are primarily focused on demonstrating compliance in a legal context \u2013 and likely do little to actually reduce discrimination or harassment. What\u2019s clear is that there\u2019s minimal research suggesting that standard harassment trainings have a positive impact and an overall dearth of studies on the subject, Edelman said. \u201cWe really need more research on what works. All we really know about sexual harassment training is that it protects employers from liability. We don\u2019t know whether it protects employees. We don\u2019t know whether it reduces sexual harassment.\u201d In California, employers with 50 or more employees are required by law to provide at least two hours of harassment prevention training, and in the University of California, all faculty and supervisors must complete a training every two years. Despite those training policies, UC Berkeley administrators and professors have repeatedly harassed subordinates and students and faced light punishments after the university substantiated allegations. That includes a famous astronomer, a tenure-track professor and the law dean, who was ordered to take a training course after he was found guilty. The questionable research makes clear that universities should not only study the effectiveness of training, but should also prioritize other mechanisms to promote prevention, professors said. \u201cThe university should focus more on having a much clearer zero-tolerance policy with very clear sanctions that are very consistently carried out,\u201d said Edelman. Tinkler said the best way to combat workplace sexual harassment is to reduce gender inequality and promote women in leadership positions. \u201cIt really requires changing workplaces that have gender inequality structured into the way that they are organized,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "Der Gang zu den Fans, going over to the terraces to thank your supporters after the final whistle has become a non-negotiable duty for Bundesliga players, second only to the mandatory wearing of shin pads. You have to do it when you win. You have to do it when you draw. You have to do it if your own supporters have just spent 90 minutes booing you and you\u2019ve lost 5-1. (Because if you don\u2019t, they\u2019ll block the team bus outside the stadium for hours until you come out and apologise). You also have to do it if you\u2019ve just won 5-1 and were booed for 90 minutes by your own fans, like Mats Hummels had been at the Westfalenstadion on Saturday. The want-away Borussia Dortmund captain coolly faced up to an island of irate fists amid the ocean of black and yellow on the S\u00fcdtrib\u00fcne. \u201cI think I\u2019m the only player in league history to get jeered before a move [has been finalised],\u201d he said, \u201cbut it was only 300 of them, a group of fans who didn\u2019t love me before either, certainly not 80,000. Not 8,000 even.\u201d Whistles and an anti-Hummels placard (\u201cThe captain\u2019s the first one to leave the ship \u2013 go now!\u201d) on the Yellow Wall were countered by friendly applause from the main stand. Two hundred kilometres further south the Eintracht Frankfurt team were so relieved to have won 2-1 in the Hessenderby at local rivals SV Darmstadt 98 that they overlooked a crucial detail on their jubilant Gang zu den Fans: there weren\u2019t any away fans at the B\u00f6llenfalltor Stadion. Or, to be more accurate, there shouldn\u2019t have been any. The DFB (German Football Association) had banned all away supporters from the match after crowd trouble at the first meeting in December; a local court had also banned Eintracht fans from setting foot in the city of Darmstadt. The city\u2019s mayor revoked that blanket ban, however, on Saturday morning. A few hundred away supporters turned up to symbolically occupy rival territory, sing about \u201cDarmstadtschweine\u201d (Darmstadt pigs) and half-heartedly attempt to break through the police cordon to get to the stadium. There were a few minor skirmishes, 530 (mostly temporary) arrests; for reasons that are still not entirely clear Eintracht ultras ripped out a bush while a few Darmstadt ultras trashed an ice cream parlour in their own city. Inside the ground a few Frankfurt fans had managed to buy tickets for the main stand, somewhere in the Nordkurve, too, among the die-hard Lilies supporters. Cue more aggro when the infiltrators blew their cover to celebrate Stefan Aigner\u2019s winner seven minutes before full-time. Riot police officers rushed in to stop fisticuffs as helicopters circled the ground and the stadium announcer castigated Eintracht fans as \u201cviolent thugs\u201d. The worst was over by the time of the strange spectacle Bild called \u201cthe most stupid celebration of the year\u201d*, Niko Kovac\u2019s men applauding in front of a vacant away end when the thrilling relegation six-pointer was over. \u201cIt was not meant as a provocation,\u201d insisted SGE captain, Marco Russ. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to make a fuss.\u201d The defender Bastian Oczipka explained the players had spotted an Eintracht flag and a few fans in the corner of the stadium; they had headed over \u201cinstinctively\u201d, Kovac maintained. The board member Axel Hellmann apologised for a move he called \u201cnot good\u201d, however, calling it \u201ca tad too provocative in view of the DFB ban. There\u2019s no need for it.\u201d To Darmstadt\u2019s credit they did not regard the away team\u2019s (empty) block party as too big a deal. The keeper Christian Mathenia criticised both sets for fans (\u201cI have zero sympathy for people who go to the ground to have a fight in between families with kids\u201d) for the flare-ups but seemed just as concerned with the home support\u2019s over-confident attitude before the defeat. They had welcomed the Eintracht team with \u201cAbsteiger\u201d (team to get relegated) chants, \u201cbut we can still go down, too,\u201d Mathenia acknowledged. After picking up many points with good ol\u2019 long-ball football and great attitude Dirk Schuster\u2019s team look as if they are running out of gas with the chequered flag in sight. They had started really well, taking the lead through Mario Vrancic and had a chance potentially to kill off the match when Haris Seferovic tugged Luca Caldirola in the box. To paraphrase Louis van Gaal: That might be allowed, welcome even - but not in this particular context. The SV striker Sandro Wagner stepped up, gave Lukas Hradecky the eyes and saw his tame shot saved. \u201cIf that had been the 2-0 I couldn\u2019t have imagined us coming back,\u201d said the Eintracht chairman, Heribert Bruchhagen. Darmstadt had dominated so much before the break that their subsequent caving-in was hard to explain. \u201dWe were afraid, we only reacted, we let them play their game,\u201d Kovac said about the first half. \u201cIt was nothing, the worst 45 minutes of my time in charge.\u201d Since the Croat took over at the beginning of March the Eagles haven\u2019t exactly scaled new heights of playing fine football but the 44-year-old has at least been able to bring an element of resilience into the team. He tirelessly pushed his men forward from the touchline and made sure to have a ball ready for his side at all times, to stop the ball boys from time-wasting. Armin Veh\u2019s easy-going hands-off regime has given way to a bit of Simeone-esque motivational intensity from the former Bayern Munich midfielder. \u201cFootball is a matter of willpower,\u201d explained Hellmann, \u201cit\u2019s good to have an instigator on the touchline, somebody who knows what\u2019s going on.\u201d Tactically, some semblance of order has returned as well. \u201cWe\u2019re not all over the shop any more,\u201d said Russ. A more concerted effort was enough to trouble the hosts: Makoto Hasebe equalised with a deflected shot shortly after the break to start the fightback. Frankfurt, for all their improvement, are by no means safe. Staving off relegation will continue to be a struggle without the services of their injured talisman Alexander Meier. He might be back for Saturday\u2019s game at home to Dortmund; he might not be. But the main thing is that Eintracht have found hope. \u201cWe\u2019re alive again,\u201d proclaimed Hradecky. Darmstadt are still two points to the good in comparison with their wealthier neighbours but the last two weeks of the season will now be much more fraught than necessary. They are only two points clear of the relegation play-off spot (before Werder\u2019s Monday night date with VfB Stuttgart), with a pair of very tough opponents (Hertha and Gladbach) to come. \u201cWe\u2019re still ahead of schedule,\u201d Schuster claimed. He and Kovac shared a warm embrace at the final whistle to demonstrate there was no need to persist with the enmity beyond the confines of the pitch and in recognition of the mounting pressure they are both enduring. Thus the most troublesome derby of the season ended on a surprisingly conciliatory note, as the authorities also pleaded for a sense of perspective. \u201cConsidering the amount of people with potential for violence in the city, relatively little happened in our view,\u201d the police director, Bernd Denninger, told Frankfurter Allgemeine. *They obviously hadn\u2019t watched the car-crash Laureus Awards, with Bill Murray as host.",

They had welcomed the Eintracht team with \u201cAbsteiger\u201d (team to get relegated) chants, \u201cbut we can still go down, too,\u201d Mathenia acknowledged.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/02/sassuolo-milan-serie-a-european-place\">Sassuolo show hare-brained Milan the value of simplicity and structure | Paolo Bandini</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After picking up many points with good ol\u2019 long-ball football and great attitude Dirk Schuster\u2019s team look as if they are running out of gas with the chequered flag in sight. They had started really well, taking the lead through Mario Vrancic and had a chance potentially to kill off the match when Haris Seferovic tugged Luca Caldirola in the box. To paraphrase Louis van Gaal: That might be allowed, welcome even - but not in this particular context.</p> <p>The SV striker Sandro Wagner stepped up, gave Lukas Hradecky the eyes and saw his tame shot saved. \u201cIf that had been the 2-0 I couldn\u2019t have imagined us coming back,\u201d said the Eintracht chairman, Heribert Bruchhagen. Darmstadt had dominated so much before the break that their subsequent caving-in was hard to explain.</p> <p>\u201dWe were afraid, we only reacted, we let them play their game,\u201d Kovac said about the first half. \u201cIt was nothing, the worst 45 minutes of my time in charge.\u201d Since the Croat took over at the beginning of March the Eagles haven\u2019t exactly scaled new heights of playing fine football but the 44-year-old has at least been able to bring an element of resilience into the team. He tirelessly pushed his men forward from the touchline and made sure to have a ball ready for his side at all times, to stop the ball boys from time-wasting. Armin Veh\u2019s easy-going hands-off regime has given way to a bit of Simeone-esque motivational intensity from the former Bayern Munich midfielder.</p> <p>\u201cFootball is a matter of willpower,\u201d explained Hellmann, \u201cit\u2019s good to have an instigator on the touchline, somebody who knows what\u2019s going on.\u201d Tactically, some semblance of order has returned as well. \u201cWe\u2019re not all over the shop any more,\u201d said Russ. A more concerted effort was enough to trouble the hosts: Makoto Hasebe equalised with a deflected shot shortly after the break to start the fightback.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33215772d50079a07a4a92478804d3c09511b2da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33215772d50079a07a4a92478804d3c09511b2da/0_51_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The empty away end at Darmstadt\u2019s B\u00f6llenfalltor stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The empty away end at Darmstadt\u2019s B\u00f6llenfalltor stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ralph Orlowski/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Frankfurt, for all their improvement, are by no means safe.

He and Kovac shared a warm embrace at the final whistle to demonstrate there was no need to persist with the enmity beyond the confines of the pitch and in recognition of the mounting pressure they are both enduring. Thus the most troublesome derby of the season ended on a surprisingly conciliatory note, as the authorities also pleaded for a sense of perspective. \u201cConsidering the amount of people with potential for violence in the city, relatively little happened in our view,\u201d the police director, Bernd Denninger, told Frankfurter Allgemeine.</p> <p>*They obviously hadn\u2019t watched<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMqmo5LLq8w\"> the car-crash Laureus Awards, with Bill Murray as host</a>.</p>",

Over half a million US troops suffer from PTSD, yet, according to the David Lynch Foundation\u2019s research, only 20% will receive adequate care due for the disorder. Through Operation Warrior Wellness, the Foundation teaches transcendental meditation to help relieve symptoms of PTSD, major depression, and help soldiers and their families learn greater resilience to stress. They aren\u2019t alone in their beliefs in TM\u2019s healing power, either. The National Institute of Health has found that TM can improve heart health and other studies have found decreased blood pressure and increased psychological well being. But when you can\u2019t meditate your woes away, laughter is a good alternative. To prove this maxim, the David Lynch Foundation brought together some of the funniest comedians around \u2013 Gaffigan, Saturday Night Live star Vanessa Bayer, Gilbert Gottfried and Louis CK for a night of jokes with some fundraising on the side. David Lynch was unable to join the festivities in person, as he was in Paris recuperating after filming the forthcoming return of Twin Peaks. Instead, Lynch greeted the audience via a pre-recorded message, which was suitably odd for the man who just spent weeks in the town of Twin Peaks (and directing a cast of 217 must be exhausting). The first star to take the stage in corporeal form was Bayer, who has been an avid practitioner of meditation for the last two years. \u201cIt helps me to be able to focus and be more creative and calm. It helps me handle things in a more deliberate way,\u201d she said on the red carpet. While Bayer is not known for her standup, she got the crowd on her side with a slough of brilliant impressions, including her SNL character Jacob the Bar Mitzvah Boy. She then acted out an entirely fantasized episode of Friends, in which she starred as Ross\u2019s love interest and delivered on-point impersonations of both Rachel and Monica. Bayer was followed by comic\u2019s comic Gottfried who is not a meditator, but merely in it for the swag. \u201cI would work a fundraiser for Isis if they were giving free lunch,\u201d Gottfried said on the red carpet. \u201cLaughter is a good medicine,\u201d Gottfried said, \u201cbut penicillin is a little stronger. If I needed medicine, I would ask the doctor to list all the available medicine and give me those first, and then after that he could tell me a joke.\u201d Gottfried was a last-minute addition to the show, stepping in for Russell Brand. On stage, he delivered a raucous and raunchy set that had the decidedly liberal New York audience laughing uproariously at very un-politically correct jokes. Gottfried\u2019s half-hour set of groan-worthy ethnic jokes had the audience in stitches due primarily to its sheer relentlessness. Following in Gottfried\u2019s vulgar footsteps was Gaffigan, a comic who notoriously works \u201cclean\u201d. Gaffigan had the crowd of 2,000 people belly laughing over his stories of accidentally smuggling doughnuts through airport security and his aversion to viewing the fall foliage: \u201cIt\u2019s leaf hospice!\u201d he announced. His set ranged from coast to coast, noting that Pacific Northwest residents dress \u201clike a hike could break out at any minute\u201d and that local news channel NY 1 is like \u201cwatching a friend in a play\u201d pretending to be a newscaster. To close out the show, Louis CK delivered a half-hour set of what seemed like mostly new material, much of which was on the topic of parenthood. One particularly entertaining bit was a riff on the Greek myth of Achilles whose mother (\u201cthe Goddess of Grip\u201d) dipped her son into the River Styx by his heel. Other material included his uncomfortable love of Matthew McConaughey\u2019s character in Magic Mike, a movie he refuses to see, the dominance of Christianity, and his own interest in peace on earth: \u201cTwo human babies have never fought,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if they had, I would know, because I Google it occasionally.\u201d If a war ever breaks out between infants, transcendental meditation could help.

      "bodyText": "Batman\u2019s \u201crogues gallery\u201d of villains is the classic comic book coterie of evil. So why have so many of them been absent from the big screen for so long? Penguin has been missing since Danny DeVito\u2019s freaky turn in 1992\u2019s Batman Returns, while The Riddler hasn\u2019t been wheeled out since Jim Carrey\u2019s nerve-shatteringly ebullient performance in 1995\u2019s Batman Forever. Poison Ivy? Well, we haven\u2019t seen her since Uma Thurman\u2019s uber-camp 1997 portrayal in Joel Schumacher\u2019s ill-fated Batman &amp; Robin. Some Batman bad guys, it seems, drew so firmly on the burlesque that they failed to find a natural place in Christopher Nolan\u2019s grim and brooding Dark Knight trilogy. But a new report on birthmoviesdeath.com suggests a number of famous villains might be on the verge of an unexpected return in Ben Affleck\u2019s upcoming solo outing for the caped crusader. So which classic Bats baddies are long overdue a new appearance in Warner\u2019s DC Comics-based cinematic universe, and who should play them? (Note: I haven\u2019t included The Joker, Harley Quinn or Deadshot here, as that particular trio are nailed on to be portrayed by Suicide Squad\u2019s Jared Leto, Margot Robbie and Will Smith). The Riddler Like a toddler after guzzling too much candy, Carrey\u2019s leering, gurning turn as Edward Nigma in Schumacher\u2019s Batman Forever is so frenzied and manic that more than a few seconds of viewing is likely to make your eyes bleed. Where the comics play on the ingenious supervillain\u2019s obsession with riddles and puzzles, making him the perfect foil for detective-mode Batman, Hollywood gave us a fatuous cackling loon whose crazed antics are even soundtracked with irritating Hanna Barbera-style sound effects. Any new version needs to be a genuine threat to Gotham\u2019s dark knight, rather than a wacky passing distraction. Chances of a comeback: High. Carrey\u2019s turn, while much-maligned, helped establish The Riddler as one of Batman\u2019s ultimate antagonists in the eyes of the public, and the villain also appeared in the old school 1960s Batman TV series and 1966 movie. Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio are among the Hollywood A-listers who have been linked to the role at various times in the past. Ideal casting: Younger actors with the ability to pull off Carreyesque levels of intensity are few and far between. Tom Hiddleston certainly has the requisite supervillain chops, and appears to have no clear current path forward in the rival Marvel universe, if Warner Bros felt compelled to throw the ultimate curveball. Napoleon Dynamite\u2019s Jon Heder would make for another fascinating choice. The Penguin DeVito imagined Oswald Cobblepot as a sinister sideshow circus freak with a vicious streak in Batman Returns, while the excellent Robin Lord Taylor gives us a gimpy, nerdy take on the TV show Gotham. Either way, The Penguin works best as a powerful crime boss with a chip on his shoulder and taste for the gothic, though Tim Burton\u2019s missile-toting penguin army was surely a step too far into the realms of the absurd. Chances of a comeback: Virtually guaranteed. The Penguin is right up there with The Joker as an ever-present member of Batman\u2019s rogues gallery, and has been a vital screen presence ever since Burgess Meredith\u2019s early turn in the 1960s TV series. Ideal casting: Boardwalk Empire\u2019s Stephen Graham can shift from cool tranquility to murderous rage in the blink of an eye, while Jason Schwartzman and Joaquin Phoenix both have the required sinister, unnerving quality. Game of Thrones\u2019s Peter Dinklage would also make a fine choice. The Scarecrow Nolan\u2019s superbly-essayed real world take on Dr Jonathan Crane was the glue that held The Dark Knight trilogy together, Cillian Murphy appearing as the demented quack psychiatrist in all three instalments, though far more prominently in series opener Batman Begins. Chances of a comeback: Middling. Affleck would have to do something very different with the fear-obsessed supervillain to make Crane worth resurrecting on this stage. Ideal casting: This could make a fantastic comeback role for Elijah Wood. Poison Ivy The extravagantly gifted Uma Thurman was perhaps the perfect actor to play the flora-obsessed villain in Batman &amp; Robin, but Schumacher\u2019s pantomime stylings foiled all her best-laid plans. Even better is the Rita Hayworth-inspired iteration from the classic TV show Batman: the Animated Series. In the era of environmental activism and militant veganism, a baddie keen on using the domination of plant-based species to take over the world couldn\u2019t be more topical. Chances of a comeback: Decent. Though Ivy surely needs a storyline of her own to flourish, rather than being rolled out as a sidekick to other better-known villains. Ideal casting: Bombshells Christina Hendricks and Elizabeth Debicki, or a post X-Men Jennifer Lawrence if Warner aims to transform the character into a major player. Catwoman A Batfleck Batman movie without the ultimate feline femme fatale would surely be a missed opportunity to add some diversity to the DC universe. Eartha Kitt\u2019s 1960s take might not be as well known to modern audiences as Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s PVC-clad, finger-lickin\u2019 dominatrix from Batman Returns, yet the role made Kitt the first black woman to achieve mainstream TV success. The comics later followed suit in a pioneering example of the kind of diversity-fuelled race-swapping that has become common in print. That led to surely the spikiest Selina Kyle yet seen, the African American sex worker version introduced in Frank Miller\u2019s famous Batman: Year One. Chances of a comeback: Anne Hathaway\u2019s relatively recent portrayal of Kyle in 2012\u2019s The Dark Knight Rises makes this one a maybe. Ideal casting: Rosario Dawson or Beyonc\u00e9.",

      "body": "<p>Batman\u2019s \u201crogues gallery\u201d of villains is the classic comic book coterie of evil. So why have so many of them been absent from the big screen for so long? Penguin has been missing since Danny DeVito\u2019s freaky turn in 1992\u2019s Batman Returns, while The Riddler hasn\u2019t been wheeled out since Jim Carrey\u2019s nerve-shatteringly ebullient performance in 1995\u2019s Batman Forever. Poison Ivy? Well, we haven\u2019t seen her since Uma Thurman\u2019s uber-camp 1997 portrayal in Joel Schumacher\u2019s ill-fated Batman &amp; Robin.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/13/ben-affleck-batman-confirmed-direct-star-in-solo-movie\">Ben Affleck confirmed to direct and star in solo Batman movie</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some Batman bad guys, it seems, drew so firmly on the burlesque that they failed to find a natural place in Christopher Nolan\u2019s grim and brooding Dark Knight trilogy. <a href=\"http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2016/05/01/you-will-probably-see-your-favorite-villain-in-afflecks-batman-movie\">But a new report on birthmoviesdeath.com</a> suggests a number of famous villains might be on the verge of an unexpected return in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/13/ben-affleck-batman-confirmed-direct-star-in-solo-movie\">Ben Affleck\u2019s upcoming solo outing for the caped crusader</a>. So which classic Bats baddies are long overdue a new appearance in Warner\u2019s DC Comics-based cinematic universe, and who should play them? (Note: I haven\u2019t included The Joker, Harley Quinn or Deadshot here, as that particular trio are nailed on to be portrayed by Suicide Squad\u2019s Jared Leto, Margot Robbie and Will Smith).</p> <h2>The Riddler</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2QVTiLGFVY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2QVTiLGFVY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Like a toddler after guzzling too much candy, Carrey\u2019s leering, gurning turn as Edward Nigma in Schumacher\u2019s Batman Forever is so frenzied and manic that more than a few seconds of viewing is likely to make your eyes bleed. Where the comics play on the ingenious supervillain\u2019s obsession with riddles and puzzles, making him the perfect foil for detective-mode Batman, Hollywood gave us a fatuous cackling loon whose crazed antics are even soundtracked with irritating Hanna Barbera-style sound effects. Any new version needs to be a genuine threat to Gotham\u2019s dark knight, rather than a wacky passing distraction.</p> <p><strong>Chances of a comeback:</strong> High. Carrey\u2019s turn, while much-maligned, helped establish The Riddler as one of Batman\u2019s ultimate antagonists in the eyes of the public, and the villain also appeared in the old school 1960s Batman TV series and 1966 movie. Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio are among the Hollywood A-listers who have been linked to the role at various times in the past. </p> <p><strong>Ideal casting:</strong> Younger actors with the ability to pull off Carreyesque levels of intensity are few and far between. Tom Hiddleston certainly has the requisite supervillain chops, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/31/marvel-tom-hiddleston-loki-movie-deadpool-suicide-squad\">appears to have no clear current path forward in the rival Marvel universe</a>, if Warner Bros felt compelled to throw the ultimate curveball. Napoleon Dynamite\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hJHHZieNE4\">Jon Heder</a> would make for another fascinating choice.</p> <h2>The Penguin</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qELPfzrDxI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7qELPfzrDxI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>DeVito imagined Oswald Cobblepot as a sinister sideshow circus freak with a vicious streak in Batman Returns, while the excellent Robin Lord Taylor gives us a gimpy, nerdy take on the TV show Gotham. Either way, The Penguin works best as a powerful crime boss with a chip on his shoulder and taste for the gothic, though Tim Burton\u2019s missile-toting penguin army was surely a step too far into the realms of the absurd.</p> <p><strong>Chances of a comeback:</strong> Virtually guaranteed. The Penguin is right up there with The Joker as an ever-present member of Batman\u2019s rogues gallery, and has been a vital screen presence ever since Burgess Meredith\u2019s early turn in the 1960s TV series.</p> <p><strong>Ideal casting:</strong> Boardwalk Empire\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/stephen-graham\">Stephen Graham</a> can shift from cool tranquility to murderous rage in the blink of an eye, while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/12/on-my-radar-jason-schwartzman-cultural-highlights\">Jason Schwartzman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/joaquin-phoenix\">Joaquin Phoenix</a> both have the required sinister, unnerving quality. Game of Thrones\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/aug/07/peter-dinklage-tyrion-lannister-game-of-thrones-pixels\">Peter Dinklage</a> would also make a fine choice.</p> <h2>The Scarecrow</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCELYhYlLtU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qCELYhYlLtU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Nolan\u2019s superbly-essayed real world take on Dr Jonathan Crane was the glue that held The Dark Knight trilogy together, Cillian Murphy appearing as the demented quack psychiatrist in all three instalments, though far more prominently in series opener Batman Begins. <br /><strong>Chances of a comeback:</strong> Middling. Affleck would have to do something very different with the fear-obsessed supervillain to make Crane worth resurrecting on this stage.<br /><strong>Ideal casting:</strong> This could make a fantastic comeback role for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/18/elijah-wood-interview\">Elijah Wood</a>.</p> <h2>Poison Ivy</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdGdXVm4SN8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gdGdXVm4SN8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The extravagantly gifted Uma Thurman was perhaps the perfect actor to play the flora-obsessed villain in Batman &amp; Robin, but Schumacher\u2019s pantomime stylings foiled all her best-laid plans. Even better is the Rita Hayworth-inspired iteration from the classic TV show Batman: the Animated Series. In the era of environmental activism and militant veganism, a baddie keen on using the domination of plant-based species to take over the world couldn\u2019t be more topical.<br /><strong>Chances of a comeback:</strong> Decent. Though Ivy surely needs a storyline of her own to flourish, rather than being rolled out as a sidekick to other better-known villains.<br /><strong><br />Ideal casting:</strong> Bombshells <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/aug/03/christina-hendricks-joan-mad-men-gods-pocket-interview\">Christina Hendricks</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/02/elizabeth-debicki-on-hollywood-i-dont-think-i-even-really-dreamed-of-this\">Elizabeth Debicki</a>, or a post X-Men <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jennifer-lawrence\">Jennifer Lawrence</a> if Warner aims to transform the character into a major player.</p> <h2>Catwoman</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXiGbkE5nSI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vXiGbkE5nSI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>A Batfleck Batman movie without the ultimate feline femme fatale would surely be a missed opportunity to add some diversity to the DC universe. Eartha Kitt\u2019s 1960s take might not be as well known to modern audiences as Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s PVC-clad, finger-lickin\u2019 dominatrix from Batman Returns, yet the role made Kitt the first black woman to achieve mainstream TV success. The comics later followed suit in a pioneering example of the kind of diversity-fuelled race-swapping that has become common in print. That led to surely the spikiest Selina Kyle yet seen, the African American sex worker version introduced in Frank Miller\u2019s famous Batman: Year One.<br /></p> <p><strong>Chances of a comeback:</strong> Anne Hathaway\u2019s relatively recent portrayal of Kyle in 2012\u2019s The Dark Knight Rises makes this one a maybe.<br /><strong>Ideal casting:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/rosario-dawson\">Rosario Dawson</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyonc\u00e9</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the latest instalment of his offence-inducing courtship of the Indian vote, Zac Goldsmith has professed his love of Bollywood. \u201cI love almost everything about [it],\u201d he enthused at the Asian awards. \u201cI love the atmosphere, the colour, the excitement.\u201d Yet when pressed on his passion, the Conservative candidate for London mayor was unable to name a single film. If only he had been briefed with our blagger\u2019s guide to Bollywood \u2026 Don\u2019t confuse all Indian cinema with Bollywood Know your Satyajit Ray from your Shah Rukh Khan. \u201cBollywood\u201d refers to the mainstream Hindi film industry based in Mumbai. It is huge, producing about 800 films and selling 4bn tickets every year. \u201cGoldsmith could have gone for a major hit with an easy title, such as PK, the highest-grossing Indian film of all time,\u201d suggests Rachel Dwyer, professor of Indian cultures and cinema at Soas, University of London. \u201cOr he could have played it safe with a crossover film such as Lagaan, which was nominated for an Oscar.\u201d Know your stars Ranbir Kapoor is the hot young guy, Radhika Apte the up-and-coming woman who does both independent and Bollywood films, and Amitabh Bachchan is the grandfather of Bollywood. Aishwarya Rai\u2019s star is descending, Deepika Padukone has already taken her place, and Katrina Kaif (British, dodgy Hindi accent) is officially huge. The three Khans \u2013 Shah Rukh, Salman and Aamir \u2013 still rule the box office and are members of what has come to be known as the 100 Crore Club, referring to any Hindi film that generates more than 100 crore (1bn rupees or \u00a310m) at the box office. When it comes to Bollywood history, go left field Everyone knows the big hits, such as Sholay and Bombay \u2013 but if you want to show your Bollywood stripes, pick a cult classic that has experienced a recent resurgence of interest. \u201cPakeezah is an iconic piece of 70s high camp that has been adopted by the LGBT community,\u201d says Cary Sawhney, director of the London Indian film festival. Featuring one of the most famous soundtracks in Bollywood history, a giant pink palace and a tragic backstory (it took 14 years to make and legendary actress Meena Kumari, who visibly ages through the film, died days after it was finished), it\u2019s perfect for the Tory politician and targets as many minority communities as possible. It\u2019s not all about \u2018atmosphere, colour and excitement\u2019 The Bollywood of Goldsmith\u2019s, erm, imagination \u2013 family-friendly melodramas stuffed with songs, dance sequences, action scenes, love triangles, twins separated at birth and lots of angry parents \u2013 is on the wane. For the first time in five years, Bollywood box-office revenues fell in 2015, thanks to a new generation of middle-class Indians who have grown up with satellite TV and multiplexes. They want fewer blockbusters and more \u201chindies\u201d \u2013 smaller independent films on edgier subjects. These might include Aligarh, a biopic about the suicide of a gay college professor in Uttar Pradesh, or English Vinglish, a feminist comedy that caused its leading lady, Sridevi, to be hailed as the Meryl Streep of India. \u201cThe new wave is neither arthouse nor mainstream, but upper middlebrow and the films are often sports biopics or costume dramas,\u201d says Dwyer. If in doubt, reference Gangs of Wasseypur Directed by Anurag Kashyap, it\u2019s not strictly Bollywood but is stuffed with postmodern references to it. A 2012 crime saga screened in two parts, it features three generations of Indian mafia and a killer soundtrack influenced by Indian folk songs. \u201cIf you want to blag it, mention it and you have instant credibility,\u201d advises Sawhney, just a little too late for Goldsmith to take note.",

At a time when the amount of revolts in this year\u2019s annual general meeting season are coming thicker and faster than those in recent years, the Norway oil fund has revealed it is preparing to target high pay. Yngve Slyngstad, chief executive of the fund, told the Financial Times that the absolute level of pay \u2013 not just the way deals were structured \u2013 was becoming an issue. \u201cWe have so far looked at this in a way that has focused on pay structures rather than pay levels. We think, due to the way the issue of executive remuneration has developed, that we will have to look at what an appropriate level of executive remuneration is as well,\u201d said Slyngstad. The Norges Bank Investment Management is so large that it holds stakes in most major companies. It supported the controversial pay deal for BP\u2019s chief executive, Bob Dudley, which was voted against by a majority of investors but, according to the FT, the fund voted against pay at Anglo American and also at Weir. Weir has faced the largest rebellion of this AGM season and was forced to abandon potential share awards for its top management team, after 72.4% of shareholders voted against its pay policies. \u201cWe are looking at how to approach this issue in the public space. We will choose the right instance for the right case of voting,\u201d Slyngstad said. The remarks by Slyngstad come as a long list of London-listed companies prepare to hold their AGMs over the coming days, including Reckitt Benckiser, whose chief executive was paid \u00a323m in 2015, double the amount the year before. Two banks, Standard Chartered and bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland, along with Rolls-Royce, GlaxoSmithKline and hedge fund Man Group, are also holding meetings. Data compiled by the corporate governance consultancy ISS Corporate Solutions (ICS) shows that two pay deals have already secured \u201cno\u201d votes \u2013 those at BP and Smith &amp; Nephew \u2013 compared with none by this stage over the previous three years. \u201cThe average level of dissent for advisory remuneration report resolutions across the FTSE All Share continues to outpace that evidenced in recent years,\u201d said Stephan Costa, executive director at ICS. \u201cMore critically, we are seeing companies failing to secure majority support with others narrowly passing, thereby underscoring the depth and breadth of investor sentiments on pay this annual meeting season,\u201d Costa said. The AGM season continues for a number of more weeks yet, when major companies hold their investor meetings, including WPP, the advertising company which confirmed last week that its chief executive, Sir Martin Sorrell, had been paid \u00a370.4m in 2015. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 May 2016 to give the full name of ISS Corporate Solutions",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In Lagos, the city I grew up in, there are not many signs that Nigeria was once a British colony. There are some unusual street names such as Bourdillon Road, named after the popular governor general, Bernard Bourdillon. There\u2019s the Ikoyi Club, formally opened to Africans in 1947 and now the preserve of the black bourgeoisie. There are a few weathered colonial buildings on prime property. These were once the homes of colonial staff, which are now destined for demolition and high rises. Not only is our British past not missed; it is barely remembered. Thus it was with a wry smile that I read of the call for the preservation of colonial buildings and monuments by Philip Davies, a former director of English Heritage. Davies frets over the dilapidation of crumbling \u201cgovernment houses\u201d, the dereliction of secretariats and the decay of clubs around the Commonwealth. He asks that the British government contribute to their preservation, as these buildings are part of Britain\u2019s history and legacy. Imperial architecture has always played a crucial role in empire building. Albert Speer, the chief architect of Nazi Germany, designed buildings he hoped would make great ruins a thousand years hence, ruins that would rival the Colosseum. The equally ambitious architects of the British empire designed buildings to intimidate, to awe, to be a physical representation of the might and the violence of empire. Their efforts make spectacular ruins. There is the British secretariat in Yangon, Myanmar, that took six years to build and is a massive construction the size of London\u2019s V&amp;A museum. It is completely abandoned today. Plants grow between the arches, damp creeps into the pillars, and the crumbling balconies may give way any&nbsp;minute. Or the countless rundown colonial buildings that litter India, once the jewel in Queen Victoria\u2019s crown. Perhaps this is the befitting legacy for all empires:&nbsp;ruins. Yet Davies would disagree. He sees these buildings not as symbols of the folly of imperialism but as a legacy Britain should be proud of. He says: \u201cAt a time when so much public debate is focused on Britain\u2019s role in Europe, I think we often forget that we built much of the modern world.\u201d It is a grand claim, in line with the grand claims made by the imperialists of the 19th and 20th centuries. But what is the modern world? What does it consist of? Large, stuffy brick buildings unfit for the tropical climate of Myanmar? A railway line built to transport cash crops from the Nigerian interior to the ports, where they would be exported to enrich the Cadburys and Unilevers of this world? Who is this modern world built for? Who is it designed to enrich? The ability to preserve and expand European infrastructure and economic models has often been used as a metric to judge the success of post-colonial nations. You build roads, you have running water, constant electricity, skyscrapers and a stock exchange: then your country is progressing, developing, moving one step closer to civilisation. If you don\u2019t have these things, you are backward, primitive, a suitable case for \u201cdevelopment\u201d. Don\u2019t get me wrong: rail networks, roads and plumbing are useful and necessary, but an abundance of technology does not equate to an abundance of civilisation. What have countries such as Nigeria chosen to preserve from the often destructive effects of colonial contact with Britain? We\u2019ve preserved our indigenous languages, our marriage customs, chieftaincy titles, monarchies and, in some parts, our communal way of life, despite attempts to destroy them. We haven\u2019t preserved these things in their entirety and complexity, nor have they remained closed to outside influences; but any conservation efforts have been centred there, not on buffing imperial statues and whitewashing colonial secretariats. As a historian, I sympathise with the case for the conservation of colonial monuments \u2013 not because they are the building blocks of the \u201cmodern world\u201d but because nations should confront painful parts of their history. This is why the jail on Robben Island was not torn down but is now open to tourists. Yet, in the same South Africa the people have decreed that Rhodes must fall. Perhaps some colonial monuments must be toppled. Either way, it is for the people of the former empire to decide how they will commemorate their connection to Britain: with ruins or with plaques. The ruins of the Commonwealth are a warning for all would-be empire builders. Remember Ozymandias, \u201cking of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\u201d",

He asks that the British government contribute to their preservation, as these buildings are part of Britain\u2019s history and legacy.</p> <p>Imperial architecture has always played a crucial role in empire building. Albert Speer, the chief architect of Nazi Germany, designed buildings he hoped would make great ruins a thousand years hence, ruins that would rival the Colosseum.</p> <p>The equally ambitious architects of the British empire designed buildings to intimidate, to awe, to be a physical representation of the might and the violence of empire. Their efforts make spectacular ruins.</p> <p>There is the <a href=\"http://yangon.coconuts.co/2015/07/21/yangon-heritage-trust-seeks-input-public-secretariat\" title=\"\">British secretariat</a> in Yangon, Myanmar, that took six years to build and is a massive construction the size of London\u2019s V&amp;A museum. It is completely abandoned today. Plants grow between the arches, damp creeps into the pillars, and the crumbling balconies may give way any\u00a0minute.</p> <p>Or the countless rundown colonial buildings that litter India, once the jewel in Queen Victoria\u2019s crown. Perhaps this is the befitting legacy for all empires:\u00a0ruins.</p> <p>Yet Davies would disagree. He sees these buildings not as symbols of the folly of imperialism but as a legacy Britain should be proud of. He says: \u201cAt a time when so much public debate is focused on Britain\u2019s role in Europe, I think we often forget that we built much of the modern world.\u201d It is a grand claim, in line with the grand claims made by the imperialists of the 19th and 20th centuries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/nov/13/architecture.india\">The rubble of the Raj</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what is the modern world? What does it consist of? Large, stuffy brick buildings unfit for the tropical climate of Myanmar? A railway line built to transport cash crops from the Nigerian interior to the ports, where they would be exported to enrich the Cadburys and Unilevers of this world? Who is this modern world built for? Who is it designed to enrich?</p> <p>The ability to preserve and expand European infrastructure and economic models has often been used as a metric to judge the success of post-colonial nations. You build roads, you have running water, constant electricity, skyscrapers and a stock exchange: then your country is progressing, developing, moving one step closer to civilisation. If you don\u2019t have these things, you are backward, primitive, a suitable case for \u201cdevelopment\u201d. Don\u2019t get me wrong: rail networks, roads and plumbing are useful and necessary, but an abundance of technology does not equate to an abundance of civilisation.</p> <p>What have countries such as Nigeria chosen to preserve from the often destructive effects of colonial contact with Britain? We\u2019ve preserved our indigenous languages, our marriage customs, chieftaincy titles, monarchies and, in some parts, our communal way of life, despite attempts to destroy them. We haven\u2019t preserved these things in their entirety and complexity, nor have they remained closed to outside influences; but any conservation efforts have been centred there, not on buffing imperial statues and whitewashing colonial secretariats.</p> <p>As a historian, I sympathise with the case for the conservation of colonial monuments \u2013 not because they are the building blocks of the \u201cmodern world\u201d but because nations should confront painful parts of their history. This is why the jail on Robben Island was not torn down but is now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/06/nelson-mandela-robben-island-prison\" title=\"\">open to tourists</a>.

Either way, it is for the people of the former empire to decide how they will commemorate their connection to Britain: with ruins or with plaques.</p> <p>The ruins of the Commonwealth are a warning for all would-be empire builders.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A huge police and security operation has been launched to keep the calm in Odessa on Monday, the second anniversary of one of the bloodiest days in Ukraine\u2019s recent history. Two years ago, clashes left 48 dead and hundreds injured in the Black Sea city. Most of the dead were pro-Russia protesters who died in a fire at the trade union building. Political and social tensions continue to bubble under the surface. On Monday authorities cordoned off the area around the trade union building, surrounding it with police and National Guard forces and keeping out those who had come to pay their respects. More than 1,000 people gathered outside the police cordon, furious at not being allowed in. The Odessa governor, Mikheil Saakashvili, said police had received information about \u201cprovocations\u201d planned for the anniversary. Authorities said there had been an anonymous bomb threat early in the morning and the area had been closed off for a search. Those outside were certain the bomb threat was a pretext to prevent them from gathering, and no officials made any attempt to keep the crowds informed about when or whether they would be let in. There were shouts of \u201cShame!\u201d and \u201cFascists!\u201d as the crowd became angrier. Many people left flowers outside the perimeter and went home. At one point, a bus arrived carrying a the mothers of some of those who died. A group of Ukrainian nationalists shouted: \u201cGlory to Ukraine!\u201d as they disembarked from the bus, leaving the women visibly shaken. The events in Odessa were one of the most controversial chapters of the period that began with the Maidan protests in Kiev in February 2014 and ended with a separatist uprising in parts of east Ukraine that received Russian military and financial backing. On 2 May 2014, as pro-Russian protests were growing in many of the cities in south and east Ukraine, street clashes between pro-Russians and Ukrainians nationalists ended with the pro-Russians blocked into the five-storey Trade Unions building, which was then set on fire. Dozens burned to death inside. The deaths were portrayed as a \u201cfascist massacre\u201d by Russian media, and acted as a recruiting sergeant for the separatist cause in east Ukraine. In Kiev, Russian media and security agencies were accused of stirring up and manipulating local discontent, furious at the pro-western turn Ukraine\u2019s post-Maidan government wanted to take. After events in Donetsk and Luhansk regions led to a war and thousands of deaths, some have claimed the Odessa events marked a \u201cvictory\u201d over pro-Russian sentiment in the city. Nationalist MP Ihor Mosiychuk wrote on Facebook that 2 May should be a \u201cgreat national holiday\u201d, as it was the day in which separatist sentiment was crushed in Odessa. In the run-up to the second anniversary, Saakashvili had pleaded with Kiev to send reinforcements into the city, fearing \u201cprovocations\u201d from Russia or local separatist groups. About 300 members of Azov, formerly a volunteer battalion with many far-right members and now part of the official National Guard, were dispatched to Odessa. By the early evening, the day appeared to have passed more or less peacefully, though police reported 14 arrests for public order offences. Yuri Tkachev, who runs a news website many believe is sympathetic to the separatist cause, said the \u201cpro-Russian\u201d movement in the city was actually not pro-Moscow but more anti-Kiev and against the Maidan protest movement. \u201cOf course there are people who would cheer if Putin came, but they are not the majority,\u201d he said. Odessa remains a divided city, said Tkachev, but with the leaders of the separatist movement either fled or jailed, there \u201care no achievable goals or any understanding of how to act\u201d among their supporters. An investigation into the events has stalled. While 20 pro-Russian activists are standing trial for the riots that took place earlier in the day, nobody has been charged with the events in the Trade Unions building that led to most of the deaths. Earlier in the day, a smaller group of pro-Ukrainians came to pay their respects at the site in the city centre where the first death occurred, a Ukrainian activist shot in the city centre. They sang the Ukrainian national anthem and laid flowers at the spot. \u201cSome people think of today as a victory day,\u201d said Yuri, who did not want to give his surname but said he had been involved in the clashes on 2 May. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to think of it as a victory when our city is still split and one half of the city doesn\u2019t think of itself as Ukrainian.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "My last therapist always told me that if I was considering ending our sessions, we would need to talk about it for at least four sessions before deciding. But when I decided to walk away, I didn\u2019t give him any warning. After what I felt was an unprofessional response to a traumatic life event, I canceled my standing appointment through the reception desk and never went back. But I never look back and regret the way I unceremoniously cut ties with my therapist through a proxy, and I certainly don\u2019t regret that I didn\u2019t give it four to six sessions worth of thought. And when it comes to disregarding the feelings of my therapist in the termination phase, I am hardly alone. The language people use around discontinuing therapy is telling. Some call it \u201cbreaking up\u201d, others refer to having \u201cghosted\u201d \u2013 a term most often used to describe the phenomenon of a romantic interest dropping off the radar without notice. This is not the same language we use for our yoga teachers or our gastroenterologists \u2013 it is the language we reserve for our more intimate relationships. And yet, when it comes to ending this special relationship, we don\u2019t treat it with the same thoughtfulness or care that we would to a romantic interest or friend. We often leave them without notice, suddenly stop scheduling appointments without explanation. But why? Perhaps it is the asymmetrical intimacy embedded in the therapist-client relationship that allows us to cut it off so abruptly. While we lay out our thoughts, fears and feelings during our hourlong sessions, the therapist remains a non-judgmental listener and hopefully, a facilitator of self-understanding and healing. Part of the appeal of going to therapy is that patients are allowed to be selfish in the relationship. \u201cThe whole point of having a therapist is not being emotionally invested in them, [and] they aren\u2019t emotionally invested in you if they\u2019re doing their job right,\u201d said Olivia, a 28-year-old woman from Seattle, who has ended three of her relationships with her therapists by \u201cghosting\u201d. \u201cTherapy is a paid service. For me, it was a business transaction that I ended and didn\u2019t feel an obligation to continue any further,\u201d she added. Therapists are professionals, of course, but they are also human. Having sessions terminated without explanation from patients can be emotional, causing doubt that they are doing their job well. One therapist went so far as to refer to having sessions terminated without notice as \u201cabandoning me\u201d. Most, however, were not devastated by abandonment so much as they were disoriented by the jarring lack of resolution. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be a fit for everyone. I\u2019m aware of this. I prefer to have an upfront conversation for closure and growth for both my client and myself,\u201d said Kelley Kitley, a psychotherapist in Chicago. Our desire to protect our therapists from hurt feelings or to avoid confronting the circumstances that make us stop wanting to attend sessions makes it easier to just walk away. Sure, the relationship is intimate, but therapists are service providers who have the cushion of several other patients to cushion the blow, we reason. Trina, a university student from California, was assigned to five mandatory therapy sessions during which discussion of not returning wasn\u2019t an option, but when her last session came, she could not bring herself to officially break it off with the therapist. \u201cI implied that I would be making another appointment. I think I lied to avoid hurting her feelings or causing conflict. She seemed to think she was helping me, and I wanted her to think she was doing her job right,\u201d she explains. We leave our therapists for all sorts of reasons: we no longer feel we need them, we feel they lack a certain investment or emotional connection to us \u2013 or, in some cases, that they are failing to provide the help we need. Diamond, a 27-year-old woman in New York, did not give notice that she wasn\u2019t planning to return when she was facing a mental health crisis. \u201cI had been dealing with serious suicidal ideation and the therapist didn\u2019t pick up on the warning signs. I never went back. I hospitalized myself and then got a new therapist,\u201d she said. When I left my own therapist, my priority was finding a new source of help and healing to get through trauma. His feelings were not just irrelevant to me \u2013 they were completely off my radar. Carole Lieberman, a psychiatrist in California, said that patients need to take on some responsibility in letting therapists know when things aren\u2019t working out. \u201cPatients need to come for at least one more session when they are thinking of breaking up with their therapist. Oftentimes, the therapist can resolve a misunderstanding that occurred, or help them to understand why it\u2019s important for them to delve into their past. Even if the patient still decides to leave, they will do so with more insight into themselves and with an open door to return.\u201d But this expectation demands a great deal, too. Is it really the job of the patient to offer tips and tricks on how the therapist can improve their approach, particularly if the patient is already in a vulnerable or wounded state? Therapists who expect everyone to be experts at the therapeutic process are going to miss or dismiss the patients who need therapy the most. Surprisingly, the therapists with the most perspective on the issue were those whose patients terminated most often: therapists treating patients who had court-mandated sessions. \u201cI spent lots of time worrying about what I could have done better to ensure their commitment to me. Having \u2018breakups\u2019 led me to do research on the most effective treatments,\u201d said Deanna F Omoniyi, founder and lead therapist at Kalamazoo Empowerment Services, which serves populations who are navigating the criminal justice system. Instead of hoping for her patients to tell her how to improve, she proactively pursued professional enrichment that would maximize therapeutic results. \u201cIt pushed me to attend trainings and seminars to better address the needs of the people I serve. So the first breakups of my career actually pushed me to be better.\u201d Because therapy is a critical and even life-saving service for so many people, we have exceptionally high expectations for therapists to execute their role perfectly every time. But all therapists are not going to be well-suited to all patients. Where one patient requires aggressive excavation of their interior life, another requires a gentler approach. In an ideal scenario, we would all approach our therapists with well-articulated, thoughtful reasons for terminating therapy, and both part ways the better for it. But if any of us were in such ideal scenarios, what on Earth would we be in therapy for?",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In a crowded field, the saga of Labour and antisemitism is a case study in hysterical conflation. All the familiar ingredients are there \u2013 from the imprecision of the deadly allegation to a series of hugely significant issues becoming lost in a foggy assault on a party leader. \u201cBlair lied over WMD\u201d comes to mind. Last week\u2019s events top the lot. Let us begin with the trigger for the frenzy. There is much to explore in what led to the dark provocations of Naz Shah, comments made before she was elected as a Labour MP. Yet there was little such exploration. Instead her social media posts on Israel generated a wave of feverish comments about how Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership had \u201cgiven permission\u201d for antisemitism&nbsp;to thrive in the party. Shah\u2019s remarks were unquestionably offensive; but they were made when Ed&nbsp;Miliband was leader. Miliband is&nbsp;Jewish. Shah stood down as parliamentary aide to the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and the problem was resolved quickly. Corbyn took his time to suspend her. The delay is a valid line of criticism, but what was the cause? Corbyn could not move Hilary Benn from his post as shadow foreign secretary when the two met during the never-ending shadow cabinet reshuffle earlier this year, although they disagree on key aspects of foreign policy. He was bound to struggle over wrecking the career of that rarity, a Labour MP who is supportive of his leadership. The hesitation may raise questions about Corbyn\u2019s suitability to meet the impossible demands of modern leadership, but does it mean Corbyn is antisemitic? Over recent days I have asked a range of MPs. Although some are fumingly critical, none of them thought so. Shah was suspended and delivered an apology that impressed some of those shocked by her original comments. The story would have subsided at this point were it not for the intervention of Ken&nbsp;Livingstone. If the former London mayor\u2019s spectacularly misjudged and self-absorbed BBC radio interview had been part of a coordinated plot involving the leadership, the story would have been the sensation it appears to be. But Livingstone\u2019s thoughtless meandering around early 1930s Hitler thinking was a freelance exercise that has damaged those he seeks to help. Who is surprised? Livingstone has always been an odd mix of courageously brilliant policy innovator and crass commentator. In an attempt to move the story on, I know of BBC producers who have worked around the clock to find Labour interviewees of any significance who would support Livingstone\u2019s Hitler analysis. They have found no one. Without new voices the story moved on with a continued focus on Livingstone. In order to frame him as an antisemite, some critics cited his comments about concentration camp guards when he was doorstepped by a Jewish reporter. But when this exchange took place the Labour leader was Tony Blair. There were no reflections then on a wider antisemitism crisis, although Livingstone then held the role of London mayor. When I put this to an MP she pointed out that Blair\u2019s views on Israel were different to Corbyn\u2019s. That is unquestionably the case. So is this ill-defined saga more about differences over Israel \u2013 highly sensitive and sometimes raised crassly, but nonetheless debated across the political spectrum for decades? As for Livingstone he is well past his peak years in office. He is not a rising star who may rule or lead his party in the future. He is not even an MP. Yes, Livingstone is close to Corbyn, but look what good that has done him. He was suspended within hours. Corbyn is attacked for not suspending him earlier. Yet given that Corbyn was out of London campaigning in the local elections when Livingstone made his remarks, that one of his senior aides worked for Livingstone and is passionately convinced the former mayor is not antisemitic, and that Corbyn was being asked to destroy one of the few high-profile figures who supports his leadership, it is remarkable the move was made as speedily as it was. Even the attacks on Livingstone became contradictory \u2013 though in ways that kept him and therefore the wider saga in the news. Last Thursday Livingstone was rightly criticised for fuelling the story by giving so many interviews. The following day there was no new development, so the broadcasters doorstepped him. When Livingstone refused to comment he was attacked for not giving them fresh interviews. The pictures of Livingstone not commenting topped the bulletins. Should he not have apologised? Should he not have explained his comments? This is a story that appears to have dramatic twists and turns but is largely driven by pictures made for TV bulletins. The Labour MP, John Mann, is the perceived hero of this saga because his target, Livingstone, is the villain. But Mann ramped up the political temperature by screaming at Livingstone in front of the cameras that he was a Nazi sympathiser. It was this clash that generated deeply damaging headlines about Labour being in a Nazi meltdown. The problem with the headline is that, apart perhaps from Mann, even Livingstone\u2019s most ardent opponents do not believe he is a Nazi. Interviewers ask senior Labour figures, every hour of the day, whether they accept their party is damaged by \u201cthis\u201d. What do they mean by \u201cthis\u201d? It does not take a genius to recognise that never-ending headlines about antisemitism and accusations against senior Labour figures are damaging. But is antisemitism sweeping the Labour party, and if so what form does it take? Now there is an inquiry. If there is evidence of antisemitism the perpetrators will be punished. I cannot imagine any leader declaring after an inquiry that he or she supports the right of antisemites to flourish within their party. If Corbyn is removed as a result of this saga his successor will fail. The bid will have been formed on the back of hysteria rather than as a result of framing arguments and policies that address more precise challenges \u2013 creaking public services and infrastructure, low productivity, housing, generational inequality and the rest. There is antisemitism and there are other forms of racism. There are crises in the Labour party. Both are serious. They are also separate; and attempts to conflate them with flimsy evidence undermine the seriousness of both.",

All the familiar ingredients are there \u2013 from the imprecision of the deadly allegation to a series of hugely significant issues becoming lost in a foggy assault on a party leader. \u201cBlair lied over WMD\u201d comes to mind. Last week\u2019s events top the lot.</p> <p>Let us begin with the trigger for the frenzy. There is much to explore in what led to the dark provocations of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/27/naz-shah-suspended-labour-party-antisemitism-row\" title=\"\">Naz Shah</a>, comments made before she was elected as a Labour MP. Yet there was little such exploration. Instead her social media posts on Israel generated a wave of feverish comments about how Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership had \u201cgiven permission\u201d for antisemitism\u00a0to thrive in the party. Shah\u2019s remarks were unquestionably offensive; but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/27/naz-shah-timeline-of-events-leading-to-mps-suspension-from-labour\" title=\"\">they were made when Ed\u00a0Miliband was leader</a>. Miliband is\u00a0Jewish.</p> <p>Shah stood down as parliamentary aide to the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and the problem was resolved quickly. Corbyn took his time to suspend her. The delay is a valid line of criticism, but what was the cause? Corbyn could not move <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jan/06/hilary-benn-labour-reshuffle-muzzled-video\" title=\"\">Hilary Benn from his post as shadow foreign secretary</a> when the two met during the never-ending shadow cabinet reshuffle earlier this year, although they disagree on key aspects of foreign policy. He was bound to struggle over wrecking the career of that rarity, a Labour MP who is supportive of his leadership.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If Corbyn is removed as a result of this saga his successor will fail</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The hesitation may raise questions about Corbyn\u2019s suitability to meet the impossible demands of modern leadership, but does it mean Corbyn is antisemitic? Over recent days I have asked a range of MPs. Although some are fumingly critical, none of them thought so.</p> <p>Shah was suspended and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/apr/27/naz-shah-apologises-israel-facebook-labour-mp-video\" title=\"\">delivered an apology</a> that impressed some of those shocked by her original comments. The story would have subsided at this point were it not for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/28/ken-livingstone-suspended-from-labour-after-hitler-remarks\" title=\"\">the intervention of Ken\u00a0Livingstone</a>.</p> <p>If the former London mayor\u2019s spectacularly misjudged and self-absorbed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/apr/28/ken-livingstone-naz-shaw-vanessa-feltz-labour-antisemitic-row-audio\" title=\"\">BBC radio interview</a> had been part of a coordinated plot involving the leadership, the story would have been the sensation it appears to be. But Livingstone\u2019s thoughtless meandering around early 1930s Hitler thinking was a freelance exercise that has damaged those he seeks to help.</p> <p>Who is surprised? Livingstone has always been an odd mix of courageously <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/28/self-igniting-firestorm-end-ken-livingstone-labour-party\" title=\"\">brilliant policy innovator and crass commentator</a>. In an attempt to move the story on, I know of BBC producers who have worked around the clock to find Labour interviewees of any significance who would support Livingstone\u2019s Hitler analysis. They have found no one.</p> <p>Without new voices the story moved on with a continued focus on Livingstone. In order to frame him as an antisemite, some critics cited his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/feb/12/pressandpublishing.londonpolitics\" title=\"\">comments about concentration camp guards</a> when he was doorstepped by a Jewish reporter. But when this exchange took place the Labour leader was Tony Blair. There were no reflections then on a wider antisemitism crisis, although Livingstone then held the role of London mayor.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/01/diane-abbott-smear-labour-antisemitism-problem-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4tn59\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2496969\"            data-video-name=\"Diane Abbott: 'Smear' to say Labour has antisemitism problem \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC One\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5725e710e4b0a2f120514bca\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/01/160501AbbottMarrAntiSemitism_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/01/160501AbbottMarrAntiSemitism_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/01/160501AbbottMarrAntiSemitism.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/01/160501AbbottMarrAntiSemitism_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/01/160501AbbottMarrAntiSemitism_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/01/diane-abbott-smear-labour-antisemitism-problem-video\">Diane Abbott: \u2018Smear\u2019 to say Labour has antisemitism problem \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>When I put this to an MP she pointed out that Blair\u2019s views on Israel were different to Corbyn\u2019s. That is unquestionably the case. So is this ill-defined saga more about differences over Israel \u2013 highly sensitive and sometimes raised crassly, but nonetheless debated across the political spectrum for decades?</p> <p>As for Livingstone he is well past his peak years in office. He is not a rising star who may rule or lead his party in the future. He is not even an MP. Yes, Livingstone is close to Corbyn, but look what good that has done him. He was suspended within hours.</p> <p>Corbyn is attacked for not suspending him earlier. Yet given that Corbyn was out of London campaigning in the local elections when Livingstone made his remarks, that one of his senior aides worked for Livingstone and is passionately convinced the former mayor is not antisemitic, and that Corbyn was being asked to destroy one of the few high-profile figures who supports his leadership, it is remarkable the move was made as speedily as it was.</p> <p>Even the attacks on Livingstone became contradictory \u2013 though in ways that kept him and therefore the wider saga in the news.</p> <p>Last Thursday Livingstone was rightly criticised for fuelling the story by giving so many interviews. The following day there was no new development, so the broadcasters doorstepped him. When Livingstone refused to comment he was attacked for not giving them fresh interviews. The pictures of Livingstone not commenting topped the bulletins. Should he not have apologised? Should he not have explained his comments?</p> <p>This is a story that appears to have dramatic twists and turns but is largely driven by pictures made for TV bulletins. The Labour MP, John Mann, is the perceived hero of this saga because his target, Livingstone, is the villain.</p> <p>But Mann ramped up the political temperature <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/apr/28/john-mann-calls-ken-livingstone-a-nazi-apologist-video\" title=\"\">by screaming at Livingstone</a> in front of the cameras that he was a Nazi sympathiser. It was this clash that generated deeply damaging headlines about Labour being in a Nazi meltdown. The problem with the headline is that, apart perhaps from Mann, even Livingstone\u2019s most ardent opponents do not believe he is a Nazi.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/01/corbyn-anitsemitic-leader-slur-labour-anti-jewish-prejudice\">Corbyn may not be antisemitic.

      "bodyText": "After discovering in 2009 that my beautiful mum, who died in 1991, was in fact murdered by my father and the woman he had formerly had an affair with, I was propelled into a new world of trauma. Loss of any form is distressing. But the intentional and often violent killing of another brings about a complex grieving process that is interrupted, sidelined and trivialised in favour of a criminal investigation. In a 2011 report of 400 families bereaved through homicide, more than 80% were found to suffer from trauma-related symptoms. When dealing with (or often not dealing with) the impact of murder and the sequence of events it brings about, it can result in multiple processes of re-trauma. We all love a good crime drama. Yet the reality of murder on the families involved is much more sobering, traumatic and, well, messier than is often projected on our screens. Behind the high viewing figures, whether for fiction or the coverage of real crimes, there are people living with murder bereavement on a daily basis. And an intrusive media experience can often compound this original trauma. If deemed \u201ca good enough story\u201d, private grief becomes public property. News is important, and when handled factually it serves the public interest. But there is a clear distinction between public interest and what is of interest to the public \u2013 the latter is problematic. What\u2019s more, many families seek out the media as this can be their only chance to have a voice in a justice process that continually strips them of agency. Their son \u2013 or daughter, or mother, or father \u2013 no longer belongs to them, but the Crown Prosecution Service. In a similar way, exploiting a tragedy for entertainment can result in further feelings of loss and lack of control \u2013 your loved one no longer belongs to you but becomes a character in a book or on television. When media interest goes beyond the reporting of events and is against the wishes of family members, the effects can be as devastating as the murder itself. Following the publication of a book that was written about the murder of my mother (described as the \u201cdefinitive account\u201d), ITV commissioned The Secret, a drama series based on the \u201cstory\u201d. It started last Friday \u2013 despite resistance from myself and my family. But The Secret is not based on a \u201cstory\u201d, a word that has been continuously used in the correspondence I have had with the production company. By calling it a story, they trivialise the reality of these events and dehumanise the impact that it has on those involved. Furthermore, careless oversights, such as the misspelling of my mum\u2019s name in emails that I had to correct, go deeper than just a trivial mistake; this echoes a disrespect for the victims and disregard for accuracy. In telling these \u201cstories\u201d, they have to re-write truth to fit a narrative that gives the impression of an assumed complicity or even authorisation from the families, which is so often not the case. Even when sticking to the facts, the information is often surplus to requirement and provides little context for the events that occurred. As Emma Brockes recently wrote in the Guardian, regardless of how well-researched true crime is, dramatic shortcuts are made: information provided by those involved is used selectively, or ignored, and an embellished account is broadcast that is in places unrecognisable to the families. One of the most painful ways this occurs in The Secret is in the character of my mum, who is depicted as no more than a down-trodden housewife. It fails to capture her ambition and drive, her wicked sense of humour, her thoughtfulness and warmth. What it comes down to is the powerlessness of families in this situation to have any sort of control over events that shape their lives. The culture we live in and its fascination with crime means that someone can write a book or film a drama to make money from someone else\u2019s life and be applauded for it. In the midst of trying to come to terms with the imminent release of the drama, our family endured the PR and social media build-up with sleepless nights and tearful days, while those responsible were being congratulated for a \u201cbrilliant\u201d production. We have been left trembling in the wake of it. The insensitivity of this intrusion is in direct proportion to the trauma that it causes. The reality of murder is devoid of eerie music or close-ups, just devastation and sorrow: first for the murders themselves, then for a justice process that strips them of control, and finally for the unnecessary sensationalisation of events in the aftermath. Truth is replaced with \u201cgood enough truth\u201d; embellished and rewritten for entertainment. The naive hopefulness that your resistance could stop all this, and the accompanying burst of misplaced adrenaline, leads only to the crushing realisation that you lack the ability to do so. You step into the ring, gloves on, but there is no fight; they have already won. Whether you choose to rise above it or fight, the result is the same \u2013 helplessness. Much like the lack of rights and representation in criminal justice, people bereaved by murder have no voice. And yet some members of the media industry continue to exploit the murder-bereaved and victims of crime in pursuit of entertainment. Surely the law needs to change in a way that enforces the human right to privacy, especially in a time of such vulnerability. Victims and their families need more options to express their voice and have more rights over their \u201cstory\u201d and the narrative of their loved ones.

Just like a pound or a dollar or a euro, one bitcoin is worth whatever people will give you in exchange for it, and just like pounds or dollars or euros, the supply of bitcoins has to be controlled or they end up being worth nothing. So Nakamoto owns the machine that prints bitcoins? No. \u2018Nakamoto\u2019 invented bitcoin by publishing an academic paper in 2008 which explained, roughly speaking, how new bitcoins could be awarded to anybody who was willing to donate vast amounts of their computer\u2019s processing time to maintaining the bitcoin system. Sounds a bit clever. It\u2019s very clever. Since being launched in January 2009, it seems to work. Some bitcoin fans think it might even become the global currency one day. Nakamoto himself is believed to own about a million bitcoins, currently worth \u00a3305m. No one could congratulate him for his brilliance, however, because no one knew who he was. Who needs congratulations? \u00a3305m is its own reward. Yeah. There were rumours though. In December some sources claimed he was actually Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist now based in London, after receiving apparently stolen documents about him. Now Wright has come forward to admit it \u2013 seemingly proving the matter by using a special cryptographic key previously linked to the same blocks of bitcoin sent by Nakamoto. Hurrah! So are the nerds carrying him shoulder-high? They are not. For one thing, there are still some doubts about what Wright claims, and he is being very grumpy about the whole thing. \u201cI don\u2019t want money, I don\u2019t want fame, I don\u2019t want adoration,\u201d he says. \u201cI just want to be left alone.\u201d He should follow James Goodfellow\u2019s example. Who\u2019s James Goodfellow? Exactly. Goodfellow patented the first cash machine 50 years ago today, but he never got rich or famous from it. Sounds great. Or maybe it\u2019s better just not to do anything impressive in the first place. Good idea. It works for me. Do say: \u201cAll right, I admit I\u2019m a multimillionaire genius, but you are not allowed to praise me.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cI think I can manage that.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Last week I reported that over a million people in the UK were estimated to have experienced destitution. Seemingly paradoxically, I also learned that demand for a multi-million pound pot of emergency cash grants for Britain\u2019s poorest families had fallen. Yes, fallen. That feels counter-intuitive. Despite years of austerity corroding the incomes of the poorest households, Britain\u2019s biggest child poverty grant-giver, Buttle UK, reported that referral rates for crisis handouts had slumped. Buttle gave out \u00a33.7m last year in small grants to 30,000 children whose families are in severe poverty. These buy items such as fridges, washing machines, baby equipment, clothing and bedding - living essentials that it argues can help drag a penniless family out of destitution and help get them back on their feet. You\u2019d reasonably expect that over the past three years demand for this kind of crisis grants would have soared. This, after all, was a period characterised by food banks, benefit sanctions, spiralling rents, insecure work, rising living costs, and a shrinking welfare safety net. Instead, Buttle has reported a steady slide in grant applications. During October 2012, its pool of 10,000 referring organisations - social services, health visitors, children\u2019s centres and local poverty charities - made a record 1,600 applications for grants on behalf of families in crisis. By September 2015 this had declined to 800, recovering slightly to 1,000 by October 2015. So why, when indicators suggested that need was increasing among Buttle\u2019s core group of beneficiaries (the majority of whom live in households with an income of less than \u00a310,000 a year) had demand for cash grants collapsed so swiftly? Gerri McAndrew, Buttle\u2019s chief executive, argues it is down to cuts to and closures of social care services dealing with vulnerable families. These cuts effectively choked off Buttle\u2019s established grant referral lines. As offices and services shut and key staff left, the contacts and know-how that kept open the flow of crisis grants evapourated. For example, between 2013 and 2015 Buttle received 21 applications from Brighter Futures, a service in Wandsworth, south London, which supported children affected by domestic abuse. After the service was closed, that source of applications dried up. \u201cWe can quite clearly say that the fall-off in grant applications is tied absolutely to local services disappearing,\u201d says McAndrew. Curiously, however, it also found that grant applications were below expected levels in areas least affected by spending cuts. The affluent likes of West Berkshire and Winchester make far fewer applications to Buttle than than even their low levels of relative deprivation suggest they ought to make. In some areas, it seems, the very poor are invisible. Buttle is seeking to raise \u00a320m to extend its grant-giving work through its Chances for Children appeal, though it is debatable whether an expanded Buttle trust war chest, even alongside other charity crisis grant givers, has the capacity to mitigate the impact of an eviscerated local welfare safety net. However, Buttle\u2019s research makes an interesting point. It suggests that cuts to public services infrastructure don\u2019t just disrupt crisis services for poor families but can reduce their access to charity alternatives. That is not, perhaps, what the progenitors of the big society had in mind.",

    "webTitle": "Craig Wright: scepticism surrounds bitcoin inventor's identification", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For years the identity of the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, creator of bitcoin, the world\u2019s leading digital currency, has eluded even the best cryptographers. So when Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist and entrepreneur, outed himself on Monday as the inventor of the cryptocurrency it seemed to be the end of a mystery that began with the first bitcoin in 2009. Wright\u2019s claim, made in interviews to the BBC, the Economist, GQ and on his blog, has fired furious debate. After his assertion he is Nakamoto, some sceptics demand technical proof. If Wright is who he claims to be, researchers believe he would own the original 1m bitcoin, worth an estimated \u00a3300m. One bitcoin is worth about \u00a3300 and there are said to be 15.5m in circulation. The BBC reported that Wright, 45, had given technical proof by demonstrating that he had access to cryptographic keys linked to the same blocks of bitcoin Nakamoto sent to another cryptographer and pioneer, Hal Finney, who has since died, in the currency\u2019s first transaction in 2009. The broadcaster also reported that prominent members of the bitcoin community, including its development team, had confirmed the claim. \u201cI was the main part of it but other people helped me,\u201d it quoted Wright as saying. Wright\u2019s claim was backed up by Jon Matonis, one of the founding directors of the Bitcoin Foundation, who said: \u201cDuring the London proof sessions, I had the opportunity to review the relevant data along three distinct lines: cryptographic, social, and technical. It is my firm belief that Craig Wright satisfies all three categories.\u201d Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, published a blog backing the claim. \u201cI believe Craig Steven Wright is the person who invented bitcoin,\u201d he wrote. However, the Economist reserved judgment, emphasising that Wright had declined its requests to provide further proof. \u201cOur conclusion is that Mr Wright could well be Mr Nakamoto but that important questions remain,\u201d it said. \u201cIndeed, it may never be possible to establish beyond reasonable doubt who really created bitcoin.\u201d Techcrunch.com reported the tech community was \u201cpouring scorn\u201d on reports that Wright is Nakamoto. Bitcoin allows consumers to make electronic transactions without commercial banks as intermediaries and outside the reach of central banks. It is a system popular with criminals. Bitcoins are \u201cmined\u201d by using computers to calculate increasingly complex algorithmic formulas and uses public-key cryptography. Users have private and public keys, so a person who can demonstrate they have the private keys linked to public keys known to have been used by Nakamoto could cite this as proof. Wright said in interviews he planned to release information that would allow others to cryptographically verify his claim. The identity of Nakamoto has been the subject of speculation since he outlined the ideas behind bitcoin in an academic white paper in October 2008. The software was developed the following year. But in 2011 Nakamoto stopped all communications with the bitcoin community, saying he had \u201cmoved on to other things\u201d. Other individuals have previously been wrongly outed as Nakamoto. In December Wright was named as the probable bitcoin creator by Wired and Gizmodo. Shortly after police raided his Sydney home and office as part of a tax investigation, said to be unrelated to bitcoin. This year Wright reportedly approached the author Andrew O\u2019Hagan, to whom he is also said to have given evidence of his involvement in bitcoin for a forthcoming article in the London Review of Books. In a taster, O\u2019Hagan reveals : \u201cThere are three computers and seven screens in his study; rows of computing books and seven dead laptops stacked on top of a bookshelf. The room is lit with two Tiffany lamps and there\u2019s a climbing machine by a green Persian rug. \u201cHe made me a cup of tea and then beckoned me over to his main computer: it was time for him to show me the proof that he was Satoshi. His manner was still that of a man who mildly resented having to prove anything.\u201d In his blog on Monday Wright posted a technical explanation, including examples of code, of the process by which he claimed to have created the currency. \u201cSatoshi is dead,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut this is only the beginning.\u201d He said he chose the pseudonym as a homage to Tominaga Nakamoto, a 17th-century Japanese philosopher, merchant and advocate of free trade. Until recently, Wright was the director of more than a dozen companies, some involved in cryptocurrency, until he divested himself of 12 of them in the space of a week in July 2015. In a statement on Monday he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t take the decision lightly to make my identity public and I want to be clear that I\u2019m doing this because I care so passionately about my work, and also to dispel any negative myths and fears about bitcoin and the blockchain. \u201cI cannot allow the misinformation that has been spread to impact the future of bitcoin and the blockchain.\u201d David Glance, an associate professor of computer science at the University of Western Australia, who has worked with Wright in the past, told the Guardian he remained \u201chighly sceptical\u201d. \u201cI would wait until we\u2019ve actually seen absolute proof that it\u2019s the case,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The MP leading an analysis into the collapse of BHS has lashed out at its former owner Sir Philip Green over the sale of the business to people who \u201ccrash[ed] it into a cliff\u201d. The retail billionaire, his wife Tina and Anthony Grabiner, chairman of Green\u2019s retail empire Arcadia for more than a decade, are being asked to appear before two parliamentary committees to give evidence about the high street chain\u2019s demise. Iain Wright MP, who chairs the Commons business, innovation and skills select committee, said Green had \u201cenormous questions\u201d to answer. Wright highlighted the sale of the business to Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt who bought BHS via a company called Retail Acquisitions last year. He said: \u201cThe question that we want to ask Sir Philip Green is, \u2018You bought BHS, took enormous sums out of the business, the pension scheme went from surplus to deficit and then you sold it for a pound to somebody who was twice bankrupt and who had no experience whatsoever of the retail sector \u2013 is that appropriate stewardship of a big, important company?\u2019\u201d Retail Acquisitions argues that it spent \u00a310,000,001 to buy BHS, because it invested \u00a310m in shares on top of the deal\u2019s notional \u00a31 price tag. Wright said: \u201cSo it\u2019s a case of \u2018is it right that people can buy a company, strip it, in many respects, of cash in terms of dividends without real regard to pensions or to employees and then sell it for a pound to untried and untested people who then crash it into a cliff?\u2019\u201d He told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWe are keen to find out who knew what, when. This issue over the sale and acquisition of BHS raises enormous questions.\u201d MPs on the committee as well as those on the work and pensions committee are taking evidence on BHS. Green declined to comment. Wright said: \u201cWhen you sell a business do you have any further responsibility or do you start to crash it into the cliff and then bail out just before it does crash? Those are things we want to look at on the business select committee and we also want to see whether the system is fit for purpose in making sure we can create long-term value rather than making sure that people can extract value out of businesses to the detriment of employees and to the detriment, ultimately, potentially, of the taxpayer.\u201d While Wright has yet to announce a list of witnesses that the business select committee wants to question, they are expected to be the same as those called by Frank Field, chair of the Commons work and pensions committee. BHS called in administrators in March, putting almost 11,000 jobs at risk, a year after Arcadia\u2019s 15-year ownership ended. Questions are now being asked about how its \u00a3571m pension deficit will affect the Pension Protection Fund, a rescue scheme funded by contributions from other pension pots. Sports Direct tycoon and Newcastle United Mike Ashley, who has resisted calls to appear before MPs over working conditions in his own retail empire, has indicated that he could bid for BHS. Green is also thought to have considered a move to buy back the brand he once owned, while boardroom veteran and former Asda boss Allan Leighton has also been linked with a rescue bid.",

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s the name of this show? Houdini &amp; Doyle When does it premiere? Monday 2 May at 9pm EST on Fox. The 10 episodes already aired on ITV in March in the UK. Does this have something to do with Harry Houdini? Yes, the noted escape artist. The Doyle in the title is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the author of the Sherlock Holmes mysteries. What do the two have to do with each other? They were friends in real life at the turn of the 20th century and were greatly interested in questions of spiritualism. However, this show has them solving crimes. You can\u2019t be serious? As serious as Moriarty\u2019s attack of the gout. (Did Moriarty have gout? It seems like he would.) The show takes the same tack as The X-Files with Doyle (Stephan Mangan) taking the Mulder role of the true believer with Houdini (Michael Weston) as the Scully who thinks that all events have a rational explanation. What happens in the first episode? When a nun is killed and a fellow sister thinks it\u2019s the work of a ghost, Houdini and Doyle make a bet with each other over whether spirituality or science can solve the case. Scotland Yard agrees to let them investigate but appoints Constable Adelaide Stratton (Rebecca Liddiard), the only woman on the police force, to babysit them. Naturally, each of them has a hand in solving the murder \u2013 Doyle by using the observations Holmes is known for, Stratton using detective work and Houdini by escaping a water trap by picking the lock. How many times is he going to save them from drowning? Probably once an episode, I would guess. So this is a procedural? Very firmly. In fact, it takes the \u201cfemale detective leads a gifted man to help solve crimes\u201d model and just adds an extra man. It\u2019s essentially the same as Castle, where a mystery writer helps a woman solve crimes; The Mentalist, where a man with magic-like powers helps a woman solve crimes; or Elementary, where Sherlock Holmes helps a woman solve crimes. Can a woman solve crimes on her own? According to television it seems impossible. Also in these shows the guy usually ends up falling for the girl (and vice versa) but what will they do here? Well, Doyle has a wife in a coma, so Houdini will have to get the girl. Is it good? You very much know what you\u2019re getting with each episode. Only the first two were made available to viewers in the States, but in each episode there is a crime (the second episode is about a faith healer) with a supernatural element. Houdini says it\u2019s all poppycock. Doyle falls for it entirely. They both go about proving that the other is wrong. Doyle solves the murder and Houdini does something else that usually involves champagne and women in bad wigs. Then they both end up questioning their stance based on what happened. For instance (spoiler warning), Doyle has to admit it wasn\u2019t a ghost that killed a nun, but Houdini sees something that he think might be a spirit. Classic Mulder and Scully. The success of the show is going to rest on how winning audiences find the two characters. Houdini comes off like a bit of a smug, American jerk (even though he was born in Hungary). At the end of their first case, Doyle says he enjoyed working together \u201cdespite [Houdini] being an insufferable ass the whole time\u201d. Doyle is a bit of a British prig and is the more interesting of the pair, with his love of psychics and ghost stories, but doesn\u2019t inspire much devotion. They also don\u2019t have a real chemistry like Mulder and Scully. They come across more like Hillary and David on HGTV\u2019s renovation show Love It or List It, concocting conflict where none should really exist. What about the woman? Constable Stratton is the best of the trio and she doesn\u2019t even get her name in the title. She\u2019s trying to save herself from \u201ca life of pretty dresses and condescension\u201d and isn\u2019t really succeeding. When she helps solve the case, her boss suspects her of sleeping with one or both of the men she was tasked with caring for and threatens to expose her and never hire another female again. This lends itself to a wonderful brand of proto-feminism that is easy to root for. Sadly, she is not even playing second fiddle. She\u2019s more like third oboe. I would rather this were a show about a female Victorian constable sticking it to her bosses by solving crimes on her own. But what would we do without a man to help her? Are the period aspects of the show good? There is a fair amount of attention paid to historical accuracy given that the show is dealing with characters that actually existed. However, it doesn\u2019t quite feel like one of the many historical dramas that litter prestige TV channels these days. It\u2019s more like the Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes films, that filter the past through the lens of the present and come up with some sort of slick amalgamation, but not so slick that it is something new. This is not realistic enough to be accurate, but not fantastical enough to be brilliant either. Should I watch this show? If you like procedurals, then adding one more to your repertoire couldn\u2019t hurt. However, there are more charming and vital ones on the air for sure. For those who don\u2019t like their shows to be formulaic, it will be as easy to skip this as it would be for Houdini to get out of a water tank while hanging upside down and shackled by his hands and feet.",

    "webTitle": "NHS health check for over-40s has marginal benefits, says study", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The NHS health check offered to everyone from the age of 40 is having little impact, according to research, preventing few heart attacks or strokes and failing to cut the numbers of people who smoke. The \u201chealth MOT\u201d offered every five years to people between 40 and 74 is intended to spot those at risk of cardiovascular disease and help them improve their lifestyle or get medication to keep them healthy. But a major study by Imperial College London, funded by the Department of Health, found that the scheme offers only marginal benefit for the estimated \u00a3165m it costs in payments to GPs for carrying out the checks. Researchers found that the programme succeeds in preventing just one heart attack or stroke for every 4,762 people who go for a check-up. GPs give them a cardiovascular risk score based on their blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), cholesterol, age, gender and other factors. Those at raised risk may be advised on their lifestyle, including diet and exercise and drinking habits or may be prescribed drugs such as statins to lower their cholesterol levels. Kiara Chang, lead author of the research from the School of Public Health at Imperial, said the findings question the initiative\u2019s effectiveness. \u201cCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death across the world \u2013 and so we urgently need effective initiatives to tackle the condition. However, these findings suggest the NHS health check scheme offers very modest benefits,\u201d she said. Among a representative sample of 138,788 people who went for a health check between 2009 and 2013, the 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease was reduced by 0.21%, the study found. There were small decreases in blood pressure, cholesterol levels and BMI. Only 21% of people eligible for a health check went along at all, the study found. Statins were prescribed to 40% of people considered to be at high risk of cardiovascular disease. This suggests the programme does not meet national targets, said Chang. \u201cNot only are very few people attending the appointments, but the results suggest that among those who do undergo the check, the number of high-risk patients placed on statins is below national guidelines. The Nice [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] guidance suggests all people deemed at high risk of cardiovascular disease should be considered for statins, and the Department of Health suggests 85% uptake of statins is required for the NHS health check programme to be cost-effective.\u201d Prof Azeem Majeed, principal investigator on the study which was published in the Canadian Medical Journal \u2013 there has been interest in Canada in starting a similar programme \u2013 said that further work was needed to establish why the benefits were so slim, as well as evaluating the most recent data from the scheme. The team also hoped to see whether certain sectors of the population would benefit from the checks more greatly than others. Majeed added: \u201cFor the NHS health check scheme to be effective, it needs to be better planned and implemented \u2013 our work will help highlight how this can be done. In future we plan to evaluate whether particular groups \u2013 for instance older patients \u2013 have greater health benefits from the check than younger patients. It would also be interesting to investigate the reasons why the health check produced such modest benefits. For instance, to evaluate the advice patients are given during the health check.\u201d The programme has been criticised before. In 2013, the Royal College of GPs said the checks were a waste of money and in 2012, research from the respected Cochrane group found they did not reduce deaths. However, a study by Queen Mary University this year said at least 2,500 people would have avoided a heart attack or stroke in the first five years of the programme. Jamie Waterall, national lead for the health check at Public Health England, said: \u201cIt is important that we review all emerging evidence for this programme. PHE has an established expert group which will look at the findings of this study. \u201cThe largest national evaluation of the programme shows that the NHS health check could have prevented 2,500 heart attacks and strokes in its first five years due to clinical treatments following the check. We know that more people could benefit from the check and we are working with local teams to deliver the best possible service.\u201d The British Heart Foundation took the view that even small improvements in the nation\u2019s health were better than nothing. \u201cThis important study suggests that the NHS health check programme is delivering some modest health gains in reducing people\u2019s risk of cardiovascular disease, which accounts for about a quarter of all deaths in the UK,\u201d said Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director. \u201cHowever, we need to do more to improve the numbers of patients attending these health checks. We also need to ensure that all patients are given the best advice and treatment in the management of conditions such as high blood pressure and cholesterol if we are to significantly reduce the burden of preventable diseases.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The NHS health check offered to everyone from the age of 40 is having little impact, according to research, preventing few heart attacks or strokes and failing to cut the numbers of people who smoke.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/apr/02/health.nhs\">\u201chealth MOT\u201d</a> offered every five years to people between 40 and 74 is intended to spot those at risk of cardiovascular disease and help them improve their lifestyle or get medication to keep them healthy.</p> <p>But a major study by Imperial College London, funded by the Department of Health, found that the scheme offers only marginal benefit for the estimated \u00a3165m it costs in payments to GPs for carrying out the checks.</p> <p>Researchers found that the programme succeeds in preventing just one heart attack or stroke for every 4,762 people who go for a check-up. GPs give them a cardiovascular risk score based on their blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), cholesterol, age, gender and other factors. Those at raised risk may be advised on their lifestyle, including diet and exercise and drinking habits or may be prescribed drugs such as statins to lower their cholesterol levels.</p> <p>Kiara Chang, lead author of the research from the School of Public Health at Imperial, said the findings question the initiative\u2019s effectiveness. \u201cCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death across the world \u2013 and so we urgently need effective initiatives to tackle the condition. However, these findings suggest the NHS health check scheme offers very modest benefits,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Among a representative sample of 138,788 people who went for a health check between 2009 and 2013, the 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease was reduced by 0.21%, the study found. There were small decreases in blood pressure, cholesterol levels and BMI.</p> <p>Only 21% of people eligible for a health check went along at all, the study found. Statins were prescribed to 40% of people considered to be at high risk of cardiovascular disease. This suggests the programme does not meet national targets, said Chang.</p> <p>\u201cNot only are very few people attending the appointments, but the results suggest that among those who do undergo the check, the number of high-risk patients placed on statins is below national guidelines. The Nice [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] guidance suggests all people deemed at high risk of cardiovascular disease should be considered for statins, and the Department of Health suggests 85% uptake of statins is required for the NHS health check programme to be cost-effective.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Azeem Majeed, principal investigator on the study which was published in the Canadian Medical Journal \u2013 there has been interest in Canada in starting a similar programme \u2013 said that further work was needed to establish why the benefits were so slim, as well as evaluating the most recent data from the scheme. The team also hoped to see whether certain sectors of the population would benefit from the checks more greatly than others.</p> <p>Majeed added: \u201cFor the NHS health check scheme to be effective, it needs to be better planned and implemented \u2013 our work will help highlight how this can be done. In future we plan to evaluate whether particular groups \u2013 for instance older patients \u2013 have greater health benefits from the check than younger patients. It would also be interesting to investigate the reasons why the health check produced such modest benefits. For instance, to evaluate the advice patients are given during the health check.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The programme has been criticised before. In 2013, the Royal College of GPs said the checks were a waste of money and in 2012, research from the respected Cochrane group found they did not reduce deaths. However, a study by Queen Mary University this year said at least 2,500 people would have avoided a heart attack or stroke in the first five years of the programme. </p> <p>Jamie Waterall, national lead for the health check at Public Health England, said: \u201cIt is important that we review all emerging evidence for this programme. PHE has an established expert group which will look at the findings of this study. </p> <p>\u201cThe largest national evaluation of the programme shows that the NHS health check could have prevented 2,500 heart attacks and strokes in its first five years due to clinical treatments following the check. We know that more people could benefit from the check and we are working with local teams to deliver the best possible service.\u201d</p> <p>The British Heart Foundation took the view that even small improvements in the nation\u2019s health were better than nothing. \u201cThis important study suggests that the NHS health check programme is delivering some modest health gains in reducing people\u2019s risk of cardiovascular disease, which accounts for about a quarter of all deaths in the UK,\u201d said Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, we need to do more to improve the numbers of patients attending these health checks. We also need to ensure that all patients are given the best advice and treatment in the management of conditions such as high blood pressure and cholesterol if we are to significantly reduce the burden of preventable diseases.\u201d</p>",

The fictional state of Zubrowka starts out as a decadent monarchy, becomes a mafia state, goes fascist, gets conquered, is absorbed into the Warsaw Pact and then, as a form of closure in the movie, becomes the classic, inconsequential member of the EU, somewhere east of the Alps. But in the real-life countries of eastern Europe, there is no closure with the past. In fact, with the rise of rightwing nationalism and outright fascism, Anderson\u2019s film begins to look less funny and more prescient. On 22 May, Austria faces a presidential run-off, where the choice is between the leader of the far-right Freedom party and a Green standing as an independent. In the first round, the combined votes of the two main parties that govern Austria \u2013 the socialists and the conservatives \u2013 would still have had them running third. The far-right won in every region except Vienna, and, even then, won half of the Austrian capital\u2019s sub-districts. The swing happened despite the centrist coalition government putting razor wire on Austria\u2019s border with Hungary, deporting thousands of refugees and demonstratively excluding Greece from the summit that effectively closed the Balkan route. Police in Austria report a 60% year-on-year rise in racist incidents, while those who monitor racism online report numerous instances of Nazi-glorification linked to anti-migrant hate speech. Take a 60-minute drive from Vienna to Bratislava, the capital of neighbouring Slovakia, and you\u2019ll find in the parliament 14 MPs from an outright fascist party and another 15 from a cleaned-up rightwing nationalist grouping. The socialist prime minister, Robert Fico, had fought the March election on a platform of accepting \u201cnot one Muslim\u201d refugee and defying the EU quota system, and has now taken the rightwing nationalists into a coalition government. Two hours away is Budapest, where the rightwing nationalist prime minister, Victor Orb\u00e1n, is under challenge from the far-right Jobbik party. Jobbik once had a jackbooted militia but is now, too, trying to clean up its fascist image. An opinion poll last year found 24% of Hungarians willing to express open antisemitic views, with the figure rising to 49% in the capital. Go north to Poland and the rightwing conservative Law and Justice party is busy altering the constitution to suppress judicial oversight of the government and stifle the press. Of course, the emergence of rightwing conservative parties that oppose migration and want to break up the EU is not confined to eastern Europe. We\u2019ve got Ukip here and Marine Le Pen\u2019s Front National, which is currently hovering just under 30% in the run-up to next year\u2019s presidential election and would come first in two out of three likely scenarios next April. But the combined rise of authoritarian nationalism, outright fascism and anti-minority racism in the east of Europe should alarm us more. First, because it\u2019s happening in immature democracies, where the media is oligarchic and under state manipulation, graft is endemic and levels of democratic consciousness and traditions are low. When a far-right politician in eastern Europe wants to make the kind of transition Le Pen has made for the FN \u2013 from squadism to Chanel suits \u2013 it does not have to travel so far. Second, because it is not being driven by the normal driver of extremism \u2013 economic failure. GDP per head in Slovakia, for example, rose sharply after EU membership in 2004. And while unemployment there remains high, at 10%, it\u2019s fallen by a third in the past three years. This is, instead, an existential swing away from centrism in eastern Europe \u2013 based on anxieties about traditional lifestyles, above all in response to the refugee crisis. Third, the rise of the far-right in eastern Europe is part of a geopolitical game. A report for the Martens Centre last year pointed out, despite the differences between the patchwork fascisms of the region, \u201ctheir astonishingly similar stance towards Putin\u2019s Russia\u201d. The European far-right not only shares Putin\u2019s goal \u2013 the breakup of Nato and the EU \u2013 but sees his authoritarian, socially conservative nationalism as a model for how their own countries should be run. While the far-right in Europe is not simply a creation of the Kremlin, the concrete ties are manifest: regular appearances on the Russian media, regular visits, invitations to monitor elections in Russia and its allied states, and then money, with Marine Le Pen\u2019s \u20ac9m (\u00a37m) loan from a Russian bank the best known example. Faced with these developments, the EU and its centrist governments seem paralysed. Article 7 of the EU Treaty allows a country to be sanctioned or suspended if it commits a severe breach of fundamental rights. But it needs two-thirds majority in the parliament and has never been invoked. This month it must draw the line in Austria. Europe must make clear it will refuse to recognise a far-right president in Vienna. It\u2019s their democratic right to elect a cleaned-up fascist; it\u2019s ours \u2013 by treaty \u2013 to suspend Austria from the EU. We know the EU can act ruthlessly against a government it does not like \u2013 because we watched it try to smash the most anti-racist, pro-social justice government ever elected, in Greece last summer. Today the countries that stood alongside Germany in its attempt to boot Greece out of the euro are the same ones who refuse to take refugees, whose media and judiciaries are under threat. As Europe dithers in the face of the authoritarians and racists, the populations in the mature democracies that founded the EU should insist: our grandparents didn\u2019t defeat fascism in 1945 to see it weasel back into the mainstream now, dressed in suits instead of uniforms, but trailing the same pathetic victimhood that excused the crimes of the past.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Radiohead have become the kings of the unexpected album release. Not only does the album itself often come as a bit of a shock, but the method of its delivery tends to be a surprise. Put it this way: the first person to buy a new Radiohead album isn\u2019t someone at their local Tesco with a crisp new tenner in their hand. So how have their releases evolved over the years? Here\u2019s your album-by-album guide to Radiohead \u2013 not the music but the way it came out. Pablo Honey When? 22 February 1993. How? Conventional physical release on EMI. What else? The recording industry was still in rude health when Radiohead released their first album. Leaking, filesharing, streaming and downloading were things of the future. Pablo Honey was released exactly as the debut album by a young alt-rock band would usually be. It was preceded by a single, Creep, that did nothing (Radio 1 found it too depressing to play). But then radio stations in other countries started playing it \u2013 Israel, New Zealand, Spain \u2013 until finally it became a radio hit on the US west coast, eventually reaching No 34 in the Billboard chart. At which point it was rereleased in the UK, reaching No 7 and getting the band on Top of the Pops. Pablo Honey peaked at No 22 in the UK, but eventually went double platinum. What the critics said: \u201cBritish teenagerhood has never been grumpier ... the best bits rival Nirvana, Dinosaur Jr and even the mighty Sugar.\u201d (Q) The Bends When? 13 March 1995. How? Conventional physical release on EMI. What else? The short and highly partial story: Thom Yorke gets sick of being rock star travelling the world with people screaming out for Creep. Makes album that consists of 48 minutes of him being fed up. That\u2019s an oversimplification of course, but The Bends was the point when Radiohead went from being a mid-level alt-rock band to an art-rock band with Something To Say. The album was preceded by the My Iron Lung EP in October 1994, which did badly enough that EMI insisted that The Bends, which had been produced by John Leckie, be remixed by Sean Slade and Paul Q Kolderie. Did the band revolt at this label interference? No. Because they realised it sounded better. It\u2019s easy to forget that Radiohead are very good at the business bit of \u201cmusic business\u201d as well as the music bit. The Bends reached No 4 in the UK, and though it went no higher than No 88 in the US, it paved the way for what was to come. What the critics said: \u201cThe album mostly reminds me of Suede trying to rock like Sparks but coming out like U2, or (more often) that hissy little pissant in Smashing Pumpkins.\u201d \u2013 Spin OK Computer When? 16 June 1997. How? Conventional physical release on EMI. What else? Radiohead\u2019s US label, Capitol, took one listen to OK Computer and decided the band had delivered their commercial suicide record. It lowered its sales forecast from 2m to 500,000, leaving Parlophone \u2013 the EMI imprint that released Radiohead in the UK \u2013 as the only ones to offer unequivocal support. The lead single, released a couple of weeks before the album, was a six-and-a-half minute, multi-sectioned epic, that the band said was a bit of a joke, really. But Paranoid Android became the defining moment of the new Radiohead \u2013 a creation myth for the World\u2019s Most Earnest Band. It was premiered on Radio 1\u2019s Evening Session a month before release, and when it came out it was hailed as a new Bohemian Rhapsody. A performance on Later \u2026 With Jools Holland on 31 May sealed the deal: this was the future of rock music. When OK Computer followed, it was received like the second coming of the Beatles, with sales to match \u2013 No 1 in the UK and many other countries. A placing at No 21 in the US, and platinum status, suggested Capitol had been wrong. What the critics said: \u201cWhere Radiohead might go from here is anyone\u2019s guess, but OK Computer is evidence that they are one rock band still willing to look the devil square in the eyes.\u201d \u2013 Rolling Stone Kid A When? 2 October 2000. How? Conventional physical release on EMI, accompanied by iBlip. (This was also the last Radiohead album released on MiniDisc.) What else? By now, Radiohead were firmly in control. Kid A was not promoted with albums or singles, but 30-second animated \u201cblips\u201d. Once again, this was an album made in reaction to the music industry rather than in conjunction with it. Thom Yorke told the Guardian \u2013 and this theme might sound familiar: \u201cI always used to use music as a way of moving on and dealing with things, and I sort of felt like that thing that helped me deal with things had been sold to the highest bidder and I was simply doing its bidding. And I couldn\u2019t handle that.\u201d And so, one of the most anticipated rock records in years was another left-turn, inspired by electronica rather than rock, and accompanied by the minimum amount of promotion by the band. Here, though, was the first of the big Radiohead release innovations: the band released the iBlip \u2013 a Java proto-app that allowed people to preorder and stream the album, and access artwork and links. The result was that the album was streamed 400,000 times \u2013 nothing now, but a landslide then. The album was the band\u2019s first US No 1, though it didn\u2019t come close to matching OK Computer\u2019s sales. What the critics said: \u201cIt is the sound of Thom Yorke ramming his head firmly up his own arse, hearing the rumblings of his intestinal wind and deciding to share it with the world.\u201d \u2013 Melody Maker Amnesiac When? 4 June 2001. How? Conventional physical release on EMI. What else? Recorded during the same sessions as Kid A, Amnesiac was a little more of a band record than Kid A had been, and was more warmly regarded by many fans as a result. Again, though, Radiohead were wrongfooting the music industry: a big band releasing an album less than a year after their last one, and again shifting styles. This bucked conventional wisdom, but yet again the album was a hit: No 1 in the UK, No 2 in the US. Radiohead were proving that artistry trumped accountancy. The lead single, Pyramid Song, was beaten to No 1 by Do You Really Like It? by DJ Pied Piper and the Master of Ceremonies. What the critics said: \u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, Kid A\u2019s wilful racket now recalls the clatter of a rattle being thrown from a pram. Tantrum over, Radiohead have returned to their role as the world\u2019s most intriguing and innovative major rock band.\u201d \u2013 The Guardian Hail to the Thief When? 9 June 2003. How? Conventional physical release on EMI, accompanied by radiohead.tv. (This was also the last Radiohead album released on cassette.) What else? Radiohead\u2019s last album for a major label leaked, in unfinished form, 10 weeks before its release. Radiohead were unhappy but EMI were far from displeased, given that what came out wasn\u2019t the actual version of the album, and still gave the group more than two months of free promotion. This was backed by an official promotion campaign that vastly exceeded those for the band\u2019s previous few records \u2013 planes with banners flying over Coachella; promotional posters for a fake talent show, with lyrics from the song We Suck Young Blood. There were two major innovations this time, though: the promotion of a phone hotline connecting callers to the \u201cHail to the Thief customer care hotline\u201d and the launch of radiohead.tv, a site with short films, music videos and live webcasts from the recording studio. If you missed the webcasts, you saw a test card. What the critics said: \u201cThat\u2019s not to say there\u2019s not some exceptional music on this record, it\u2019s just once again the impact of the best moments is dulled by the inclusion of some indifferent electronic compositions.\u201d \u2013 NME In Rainbows When? 10 October 2007. How? Direct to the public via inrainbows.com, on a pay-what-you-like model. What else? Radiohead\u2019s contract with EMI had expired after Hail to the Thief, and when the private equity firm Terra Firma acquired the record company in August 2007, the band decided to strike out on their own. That summer, they set up their own company, Xurbia Xendless Ltd, which eventually released In Rainbows. The album wasn\u2019t a surprise, though: Jonny Greenwood announced the record on 1 October, with a link to preorder the MP3 version. Yorke explained the logic to David Byrne in Wired: \u201cWe were trying to avoid that whole game of who gets in first with the reviews. These days there\u2019s so much paper to fill, or digital paper to fill, that whoever writes the first few things gets cut and pasted. Whoever gets their opinion in first has all that power. Especially for a band like ours, it\u2019s totally the luck of the draw whether that person is into us or not. It just seems wildly unfair, I think.\u201d This time, the world really took notice of the release strategy \u2013 in some ways it rather overshadowed the actual music. There\u2019s little doubt that this was the release that made other superstar acts realise the benefits they could accrue \u2013 both in terms of finance, and control of the discussion about their record \u2013 by self-releasing their records under strictly controlled conditions. Radiohead simultaneously ensured they would have the kudos of getting their music out to fans who couldn\u2019t or didn\u2019t want to pay much, while shoring up revenue streams by releasing a deluxe box set with additional music and vinyl at a premium price. The giveaway worked, too \u2013 most downloaders paid a normal retail price, according to the band\u2019s management. A retail release followed, enabling Radiohead to get the No 1 that their own release was ineligible for. What the critics said: \u201cLiberated from their self-imposed pressure to innovate, they sound \u2013 for the first time in ages \u2013 user-friendly; the glacial distance that characterised their previous records melted away by dollops of reverb, strings, and melody.\u201d \u2013 Pitchfork The King of Limbs When? 18 February 2011. How? Direct to the public to download via their website. What else? Once again, Radiohead set up a company \u2013 Ticker Tape Ltd, in December 2010 \u2013 to look after the self-releasing of their new album. Again, they only gave a few days\u2019 notice, though they ended up putting The King of Limbs out a day earlier than they had said. Again, it was available to download from a website, though this time there were fixed prices. Again, there was a deluxe edition available at a premium price. Again, it was later released in conventional retail form later on. (Thom Yorke would later take the instant-download release to its logical conclusion by releasing his solo album, Tomorrow\u2019s Modern Boxes, through BitTorrent.) The release of The King of Limbs was promoted with a 12-page newspaper, The Universal Sigh, given away in record stores. This time, retail sales were down \u2013 the album peaked at No 7 in the UK and No 3 in the US. But when you have been selling direct to fans with sales that don\u2019t count towards the chart, those placings look like something of a triumph. What the critics said: \u201cYou\u2019re reminded that Radiohead are the only band of their size and status that seem driven by an impulse to twist their music into different shapes. As The King of Limbs proves, when it works it\u2019s glorious, but that impulse doesn\u2019t always yield perfect results.\u201d \u2013 The Guardian Album No 9 (no title known as yet) When: Rumoured to be this week. How: Your guess is as good as mine. What else? We know something is in the works. The band have spoken about having recorded a new album. They released a James Bond theme that the makers of Spectre didn\u2019t want. They\u2019ve announced headline shows for this summer. And then a member of their management company, Brian Message, said the album would be coming out in June. That was hastily reconsidered by observers on Sunday, when the band erased their internet presence. Their website is blank, as is their Twitter feed (along with Thom Yorke\u2019s), as is their Facebook page. Here\u2019s a thought, though: over the past couple of years, members of Radiohead and their management team have been seen at shows by the 1975 and visiting the younger band\u2019s dressing room. Last year, the 1975 deleted their social media for 24 hours before returning with the build up to their second album. Is it possible Radiohead have been looking at and adapting some of the methods tried by a band who are very good at using social media to their own advantage and communicating with their fans?",

Leaking, filesharing, streaming and downloading were things of the future. Pablo Honey was released exactly as the debut album by a young alt-rock band would usually be. It was preceded by a single, Creep, that did nothing (Radio 1 found it too depressing to play). But then radio stations in other countries started playing it \u2013 Israel, New Zealand, Spain \u2013 until finally it became a radio hit on the US west coast, eventually reaching No 34 in the Billboard chart. At which point it was rereleased in the UK, reaching No 7 and getting the band on Top of the Pops. Pablo Honey peaked at No 22 in the UK, but eventually went double platinum.</p> <p><strong>What the critics said:</strong> \u201cBritish teenagerhood has never been grumpier ... the best bits rival Nirvana, Dinosaur Jr and even the mighty Sugar.\u201d (Q)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFkzRNyygfk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XFkzRNyygfk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>The Bends</h2> <p><strong>When?</strong> 13 March 1995.</p> <p><strong>How?</strong> Conventional physical release on EMI.</p> <p><strong>What else?</strong> The short and highly partial story: Thom Yorke gets sick of being rock star travelling the world with people screaming out for Creep.

(Thom Yorke would later take the instant-download release to its logical conclusion by releasing his solo album, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/29/thom-yorke-tomorrows-modern-boxes-review-distribution\">Tomorrow\u2019s Modern Boxes</a>, through BitTorrent.) </p> <p>The release of The King of Limbs was promoted with a 12-page newspaper, The Universal Sigh, given away in record stores. This time, retail sales were down \u2013 the album peaked at No 7 in the UK and No 3 in the US. But when you have been selling direct to fans with sales that don\u2019t count towards the chart, those placings look like something of a triumph.</p> <p><strong>What the critics said:</strong> \u201cYou\u2019re reminded that Radiohead are the only band of their size and status that seem driven by an impulse to twist their music into different shapes. As The King of Limbs proves, when it works it\u2019s glorious, but that impulse doesn\u2019t always yield perfect results.\u201d \u2013 The Guardian</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOa1a8hYP8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cfOa1a8hYP8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>Album No 9 (no title known as yet)</h2> <p><strong>When:</strong> Rumoured to be this week.</p> <p><strong>How:</strong> Your guess is as good as mine.</p> <p><strong>What else?</strong> We know something is in the works. The band have spoken about having recorded a new album. They released <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/26/radioheads-bond-theme-the-gift-that-fans-didnt-spectre-receive-for-christmas\">a James Bond theme</a> that the makers of Spectre didn\u2019t want. They\u2019ve announced headline shows for this summer. And then a member of their management company, Brian Message, said the album would be coming out in June. That was hastily reconsidered by observers on Sunday, when the band erased their internet presence. Their <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://radiohead.com/\">website is blank</a>, as is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/radiohead?lang=en\">their Twitter feed</a> (along with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/thomyorke?lang=en\">Thom Yorke\u2019s</a>), as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/radiohead\">is their Facebook page</a>. Here\u2019s a thought, though: over the past couple of years, members of Radiohead and their management team have been seen at shows by the 1975 and visiting the younger band\u2019s dressing room. Last year, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jun/02/the-1975-their-disappearance-was-a-stunt-yes-but-it-was-brilliant\">the 1975 deleted their social media for 24 hours</a> before returning with the build up to their second album. Is it possible Radiohead have been looking at and adapting some of the methods tried by a band who are very good at using social media to their own advantage and communicating with their fans?</p>",

Chief among the critical voices has been that of Joe Corr\u00e9, son of Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood, who has claimed the events have been \u201cgiven the Queen\u2019s blessing\u201d, and represent \u201calternative and punk culture being appropriated by the mainstream\u201d. This once radical movement, he said, is becoming \u201clike a fucking museum piece or tribute act\u201d. In response, Corr\u00e9 has announced that he\u2019s going to burn \u00a35m worth of punk memorabilia \u2013 an action that, rather winningly, has been added to Punk London\u2019s online list of upcoming commemorative events: \u201c26 Nov: Joe Corr\u00e9 burns his punk stuff.\u201d Clearly this is just the kind of cocktail of recklessness, provocation and look-at-me self-publicising that his late father would have loved. Nevertheless, you could argue all night about whether Corr\u00e9 has a point, or whether the co-opting of punk by the mainstream happened so long ago as to render his argument irrelevant. It\u2019s nearly 20 years since the Sex Pistols\u2019 1976 appearance on the Today Show, once a source of national outrage, took its place next to Benny Hill and Morecambe and Wise on a collection of classic Thames TV moments. You might also wonder where exactly Corr\u00e9 got his intel that Her Majesty is on board with, say, the Design Museum\u2019s fanzine-making workshop. But even if you don\u2019t share Corr\u00e9\u2019s aversion to nostalgia, it\u2019s easy to feel that the story of punk has become over-told in recent years. That the movement has been reduced to a series of tired and occasionally inaccurate bullet points by endless BBC4 documentaries that are apparently obliged by law to cut from footage of an angry man standing by a brazier and rubbish piling up in Leicester Square in early 1979 to the Sex Pistols performing Anarchy in the UK on ITV\u2019s So It Goes nearly three years earlier. Perhaps a slightly more complex, nuanced account of what happened in 1976 will emerge from all the events scheduled in London over the coming months. The centrepiece is probably Punk 1976-78, an exhibition that opens at the British Library on 13 May, featuring rare material from the collection of Jon Savage, punk archivist and author of the definitive punk history, England\u2019s Dreaming. Elsewhere, there are a multitude of photography exhibitions \u2013 certainly no one is going to be able to complain that they didn\u2019t see enough black and white shots of Johnny Rotten \u2013 of which the pick might be Anita Corbin\u2019s Visible Girls, a collection of photos of youth subcultures that includes new romantics, mods and rockabillies as well as punks. There\u2019s also a film festival at the BFI curated by the musician and film-maker Don Letts; a weekend of music and spoken word at the Roundhouse to commemorate the Ramones\u2019 legendary 4 July 1976 concert at the same venue; and a special \u201cpunk strand\u201d at the Stoke Newington literary festival \u2013 presumably something to do with key player in the festival and \u201ccoolest librarian in the world\u201d, former Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon. There\u2019s also a major exhibition at a venue yet to be confirmed, which purports to show \u201cthe lasting impact of punk on British fashion from Westwood to McQueen and Vogue to Vice\u201d \u2013 a description that raises the question of where the curators of Punk London think the movement\u2019s legacy resides 40 years on, if anywhere. \u2022 Punk London: 40 Years of Subversion, various London venues until 26 November.",

We are all part of a culture that is desperately inhospitable to women at any age. We are told our lives don\u2019t matter unless, of course, we are wives or mothers, and then we only matter insofar as we adequately perform those roles. I am getting older. I suppose I am losing my looks, whatever looks I may have had. My hair is going white at an alarming rate and in some alarming places. My body is changing. With each passing day, I am confronted by new aches and discomforts, and I find myself groaning when I sit in a comfortable chair. Certain masses on my body are shifting and not to my advantage. I tell myself I am not yet middle-aged, but my body laughs. Something else is also happening, though. I am becoming more comfortable in who I am, even as my body betrays me, even as I continue to fight the lifelong battle to feel comfortable in my skin. I am getting older, but I know things now. I am confident in my voice. I am more accepting and even accommodating of who I am because I recognise that this far in, I cannot change who I really am, I don\u2019t want to change who I really am. And in this comfort, I find that I don\u2019t mind that I am getting older or becoming invisible because I know how to make myself seen. I know how to make it clear that my joyfully imperfect life matters. When a woman artist uses her work to capture the lives of women, I am always intrigued because as women, we have such intimate, common ground, but we are also different in the identities we inhabit, the lives we have lived, the way our bodies have been marked by the lives we have lived. I want to tread both that common ground and the different. In Her, Marjorie Salvaterra allows us to see who she is, as she is, a 43-year-old woman. She makes herself more than visible. Through her camera lens, she makes herself, and a number of other women, seen and heard. This astonishing collection of photographs is more than documentary. The images herein are strange, unexpected, whimsical, provocative. Salvaterra manipulates light and shadow, and the bodies of women. In so many of the pictures, women\u2019s bodies are presented plainly. These women wear their skin without apology. Their eyes are darkened, the better we may see them. They wear wild wigs, big and bold, taking up space in ways women are often denied. Many of the images offer up compelling stories and there is a current of sly wit running from the beginning of Her through the end. Take Her Last Supper, for example. Twelve women, around a long table, inside a mausoleum. Each woman is a portrait unto herself as she looks toward the woman at the centre of the table who is looking down, the palms of her hands placed flat against the table. And then there is one woman, one arm across her stomach, who is looking away. We know not what she says but to follow her gaze is a journey. Indeed, to follow each of the images in Her is a journey into womanhood, a journey with innumerable destinations, and one that left me, and hopefully everyone who takes in this collection, shouting, to all the joyfully imperfect hers to be found in Her and beyond: I see you.

They wear wild wigs, big and bold, taking up space in ways women are often denied.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27e9f1492f96c4ef8a2c29fe1fa68cb87e1d12c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27e9f1492f96c4ef8a2c29fe1fa68cb87e1d12c2/0_0_6300_4200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Her Last Supper by Marjorie Salvaterra.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Her Last Supper by Marjorie Salvaterra.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of the images offer up compelling stories and there is a current of sly wit running from the beginning of Her through the end.

      "bodyText": "Skepta: Konnichiwa The thrilling revival of Skepta has mirrored that of UK grime itself. Before the Tottenham rapper was owning 2015 with his track Shutdown, his career had become derailed by the lure of major label money, and he was making cheesy tracks about Rolex watches with tacky dance routines in an attempt to mimic Dizzee\u2019s Bonkers rise. Skepta has since found strength through going back to basics, and although comeback album Konnichiwa has been delayed, you get the sense that it\u2019s because he\u2019s determined to get this one right. \u20226 May, Boy Better Know. Busted With McBusted on the road last year, you could be forgiven for thinking that fans of early noughties pop-punk would be over re-formation hysteria. However, with the return of Charlie Simpson, who left Busted 10 years ago vowing never to return, 100,000 arena concert tickets were shifted in the first hour of their release. The band \u2013 also featuring Matt Willis and James Bourne \u2013 aim to entice fans old and new by bringing British YouTuber Emma Blackery and Teenage Dirtbag rock group Wheatus on the road for their Pigs Can Fly tour. Cartoonishly charismatic as ever. \u202211 May, Wembley SSE Arena, London. Then touring until 4 June. Bob Dylan: Fallen Angels Bob Dylan\u2019s late-career reinvention as a crooner continues with a second successive set of standards \u2013 all bar one previously recorded by Frank Sinatra. This most quixotic of performers is now spilling all his musical facets out, one after another \u2013 last year it was an 18CD set of every note he recorded during 1965 and 1966 \u2013 as if daring anyone to suggest they know what he represents. The contrast between the Thin Wild Mercury Sound of 50 years ago and the ragged crooner of today could hardly be greater. \u202220 May, Sony/Columbia. Adam Ant To tie in with a deluxe box set of Adam and the Ants\u2019 breakthrough second album, Kings of the Wild Frontier \u2013 which with its cocktail of African-inspired drums, spaghetti western guitar and Native American-influenced whooping and chanting is surely one of the most unlikely records in pop history to propel an artist to teenybopper stardom \u2013 the band\u2019s redoubtable mastermind, still a brilliant live performer, will take to the stage to play the album in its entirety. \u202223 May, Ipswich Regent theatre. Then touring until 10 June. Bruce Springsteen The Boss shows no signs of slowing down: at 66, he still stages large tours at a moment\u2019s notice, still plays for more than three hours, still leaves audiences exhilarated and baying for more. This latest jaunt with the E Street Band sees him revisit his 1980 double album The River, playing it in full and then adding on what for most bands would be a whole additional set of extra material. There\u2019ll be no gimmicks, no visual effects, no state-of-the-art technology; just rock\u2019s most versatile band and one man who can hold a stadium crowd in the palm of his hand. \u202225 May, Etihad Stadium, Manchester. Then touring UK and Ireland until 5 June. Radiohead After playing London\u2019s O2 on their previous trip to the capital, this time around Radiohead, much to the misery of millions of fans, decided to downscale to three nights at the 3,000-capacity Roundhouse, a former railway engine shed. The news of a tour was accompanied by the usual frenzied speculation about a new album, which, according to one member of their management company, sounds \u201clike nothing you\u2019ve ever heard\u201d. Regardless of whether ticketholders will be privy to revolutionary new material or simply slurring along to Karma Police, every era of the band\u2019s back catalogue guarantees melancholic euphoria. \u202226, 27 and 28 May, Roundhouse, London. Beth Orton: Kidsticks Not many people would have predicted Beth Orton\u2019s next move would be to collaborate on a krautrock-inspired electropop album with one of Fuck Buttons, but we\u2019re pleased it\u2019s happened. From the tracks Orton has premiered so far (Moon and 1973), Kidsticks promises to be a radical departure from 2012\u2019s folky Sugaring Season, one that is both synth-heavy and rhythmically interesting. \u202227 May, Anti Records. ABC: The Lexicon of Love II It\u2019s a bold move on the part of Martin Fry, the only remaining member of the ABC lineup who recorded their debut album, to announce a sequel, nearly 35 years on. The Lexicon of Love may be the most celebrated album to emerge from the early 80s \u201cnew pop\u201d movement: a lavish confection of classic pop songwriting, dancefloor infections and sumptuous strings and brass, the latter the work of arranger Anne Dudley, who reprises her role on the sequel. \u2022 27 May, Virgin/EMI. Dexys Do Irish and Country Soul The day Dexys do something you expect is the day they cease to be Dexys. In 2012, One Day I\u2019m Going to Soar, the band\u2019s excellent comeback album after 27 years away, saw them embracing their theatrical side. But the forthcoming Let the Record Show: Dexys Do Irish and Country Soul appears to be an about-turn, consisting of soulful interpretations of predominantly Irish folk standards such as Carrickfergus and Curragh of Kildare. Kevin Rowland says it\u2019s a project he has wanted to get off the ground since the mid-80s, and with typical contrariness the band tell us that it is not a covers album. So there you go. \u20223 June, Rhino Records. AC/DC with Axl Rose AC/DC sacrificed a great deal of goodwill with the way they dispensed of their singer of 36 years, Brian Johnson, after doctors told him to quit or risk losing his hearing. Their statement on the matter was terse to the point of rudeness. The appointment of Guns N\u2019 Roses leader Axl Rose as his short-term replacement will shore up ticket sales, but raises questions: how will the world\u2019s most efficient rock\u2019n\u2019roll organisation cope with having the planet\u2019s most unpredictable frontman on board? \u20224 June, Olympic Stadium, London; 9 June, Etihad Stadium, Manchester. Lionel Richie Has last year\u2019s Glastonbury festival revived Lionel Richie\u2019s previously somewhat cheesy reputation? His pottery-based exploits in the Hello video combined with a dedication to the sexytime album sleeve had helped make him something of a guilty pleasure over the years. But his Sunday afternoon slot on the Pyramid stage drew more punters than any of the headliners. He\u2019ll be hoping to revive the communal magic at a series of arena shows from Colwyn Bay to Colchester. \u202214 and 15 July, St Austell, Cornwall. Then touring to 7 July. Africa Oy\u00e9 2016 The Liverpool festival \u2013 the UK\u2019s largest free celebration of African and Caribbean music \u2013 returns with a lineup that includes much-praised new Congolese band Mbongwana Star and Ghanaian veteran Pat Thomas, along with Randy Valentine from Jamaica. \u2022June 18 to 19, Sefton Park, Liverpool. Glastonbury festival The annual hippy utopia that is Glastonbury returns, and following last year\u2019s divisive Kanye set, this year\u2019s headliners pander to the British masses. Muse, Adele and Coldplay top the bill on the Pyramid stage, but there\u2019s plenty to uncover elsewhere, with leftfield loopiness, seasoned legends, and, er, Jeremy Corbyn. Confirmed names so far include LCD Soundsystem, PJ Harvey, Beck, Foals, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Ellie Goulding, Skepta, the 1975, Grimes, Mac DeMarco, Savages, Art Garfunkel and Cyndi Lauper. \u202222 to 26 June, Worthy Farm, Somerset. Rae Sremmurd: StremLife 2 Rae Sremmurd are two Mississippi brothers, now based in Atlanta, who are happy to mess around with hip-hop\u2019s preconceptions. Songs about Donald Trump? Live shows in snorkelling gear? Why not, eh? With tracks such as Start a Party, Shake It Fast and Set the Roof, don\u2019t expect forthcoming album SremmLife 2 to be this year\u2019s To Pimp a Butterfly. But do expect it to sound great when you\u2019re drunk. \u202224 June, Eardrummers. Beyonc\u00e9 Her new album, Lemonade, has led some to claim Beyonc\u00e9 is a kind of musical cross between Martin Luther King and Maya Angelou. She\u2019s also a shrewd businesswoman who knows precisely the value of her brand \u2013 which is why tickets for her shows aren\u2019t just seated or standing: you can also get BeyHive, BeyGoldCircle, Platinum and Beyswag packages, depending on just how much money you want to spend. The shows will be spectacular, but the real winner will be Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s bank account. \u202228 June, Stadium of Light, Sunderland. Then touring until 7 July. Maxwell: blackSUMMERS\u2019night Before there was Miguel there was Maxwell. Twenty years after his definitive neo-soul album, Urban Hang Suite, the Brooklyn singer returns to the jazz-inflected R&amp;B scene he helped establish. The new album, blackSUMMERS\u2019night, comes after a seven-year absence, during which he turned 40, and experienced the deaths of his cousin and his grandmother. Part two of a musical trilogy \u2013 following 2009\u2019s Grammy award-winning BLACKsummers\u2019night \u2013 finds the artist readjusting his mindset but retaining his inimitable smoothness. \u20221 July, Sony/Columbia. Possibly Colliding This new music weekend curated by contemporary composer and pianist Nils Frahm boasts boundary-pushing musicians, from Penguin Cafe, Wildbirds and Peacedrums to Britten Sinfonia Voices. The German-born Frahm, who sits where contemporary classical meets electronic music, will also play his only gig of 2016. \u20221 to 3 July, Barbican, London. Love Supreme Jazz Festival The South Downs festival returns with an ambitious mix of big-name jazz, soul, funk, r&amp;b and hip-hop. Pop legends such as Burt Bacharach and Grace Jones share the bill with jazz-inspired singer-songwriters Esperanza Spalding and Melody Gardot, meteorically risen saxist-bandleader Kamasi Washington, the new trio of guitarist John Scofield, pianist Brad Mehldau and drummer Mark Guiliana, as well as a raft of local talent. \u20221 to 3 July, Glynde, Lewes. Kendrick Lamar at Hyde Park Last year, Kendrick Lamar\u2019s To Pimp a Butterfly won every critics\u2019 poll going, from Pitchfork to Waste Management News (probably), and garnered praise for confronting the rising inequalities and racial tension bubbling away in America, and for its melding of modern production (courtesy of Flying Lotus, Thundercat) with the retro feel of 70s jazz and psychedelic soul. But having to translate its anger and underlying torment to a sunny park in London \u2013 not always the easiest outdoor music venue in which to make a connection \u2013 means the challenges haven\u2019t ended for him just yet. \u20222 July, BST Hyde Park, London. Carole King at Hyde Park Perhaps the success of Beautiful, the musical based on her songs and life story, has convinced the queen of the Laurel Canyon set that it\u2019s worth her coming to London to perform her 1971 smash album Tapestry in its entirety for the first time. While audience tears will doubtless be shed, it\u2019s a moot point whether standing in a crowd of 60,000, a quarter of a mile from the stage, is the best way to hear this intimate record being played live. \u20223 July, BST Hyde Park, London. T in the Park In its second year at Strathallan Castle in Perthshire, the T in the Park festival will showcase the titans of baggy, EDM and funk pop on the main stage. Headliners the Stone Roses, Calvin Harris and the Red Hot Chili Peppers top a populist bill that also includes old-school ravers Faithless, new-school electronic acts Jamie XX and Disclosure, acoustic revivalist Jake Bugg, indie veterans Shed 7 and the Coral, and chart pop disruptors Bastille, the 1975 and Jess Glynne. \u20228 to 10 July, Strathallan Castle, Perthshire. Womad 2016 Britain\u2019s best-known world music festival has succeeded thanks to its bravely eclectic approach. This year\u2019s lineup has Senegalese veteran Baaba Maal, Saharawi star Aziza Brahim, Colombia\u2019s Sidestepper and Vietnam\u2019s Hanoi Masters. There\u2019s also American funk and soul from George Clinton Parliament Funkadelic. \u202228 to 31 July, Charlton Park, Wiltshire. Flit A handful of folk\u2019s most visionary thinkers collaborate with BAFTA-winning animators to explore tales of migration through music and animation. Becky Unthank and Edinburgh-born singer songwriter Adam Holmes perform songs by Scottish musician Martin Green (best known as Lau\u2019s accordion genius) with lyrics \u2013 inspired by first-hand stories \u2013 by Karine Polwart, Aidan Moffat, Sandy Wright and Anais Mitchell. Whiterobot (Will Anderson and Ainslie Henderson ) bring their trademark wit and wisdom to the visuals. \u202210 to 11 August, Edinburgh International Conference Centre. Green Man festival Arguably the summer\u2019s nicest festival \u2013 its closest rival is End of the Road, in Dorset in September \u2013 Green Man offers a stunning location in the Brecon Beacons, plenty to do that isn\u2019t music, including talks, films and activities, and a list of artists who bathe in acclaim: Belle &amp; Sebastian, James Blake, Julia Holter, Jason Isbell, White Denim, Floating Points and many more. Do take waterproofs though: Green Man has a reputation for dampness. \u202218 to 21 August, Brecon Beacons, Wales. Reading and Leeds festivals The rite-of-passage festivals for kids who have just got their GCSE results are now split three ways: part rock, part dance, part hip-hop (with a smattering of pop). It\u2019s hard to see what appeal Red Hot Chili Peppers will have for the teens, but Disclosure, Foals, the 1975, Skrillex\u2019s Jack \u00dc and A$AP Rocky will surely attract heaving throngs. Those who miss the days when Reading was all about metal should congregate at the Pit stage to catch the likes of Mastodon. \u202226 to 28 August, Richfield Avenue, Reading, and Bramham Park, Leeds.",

This latest jaunt with the E Street Band sees him revisit his 1980 double album The River, playing it in full and then adding on what for most bands would be a whole additional set of extra material. There\u2019ll be no gimmicks, no visual effects, no state-of-the-art technology; just rock\u2019s most versatile band and one man who can hold a stadium crowd in the palm of his hand. <br />\u202225 May, Etihad Stadium, Manchester. <a href=\"http://brucespringsteen.net/category/live-dates\">Then touring</a> UK and Ireland until 5 June.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2912b918570aeb3fdf638b12f339841868ad5496\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2912b918570aeb3fdf638b12f339841868ad5496/6_133_4889_2933/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Springsteen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Back to the river \u2026 Bruce Springsteen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Radiohead</h2> <p>After playing London\u2019s O2 on their previous trip to the capital, this time around Radiohead, much to the misery of millions of fans, decided to downscale to three nights at the 3,000-capacity Roundhouse, a former railway engine shed. The news of a tour was accompanied by the usual frenzied speculation about a new album, which, according to one member of their management company, sounds \u201clike nothing you\u2019ve ever heard\u201d. Regardless of whether ticketholders will be privy to revolutionary new material or simply slurring along to Karma Police, every era of the band\u2019s back catalogue guarantees melancholic euphoria. <br />\u202226, 27 and 28 May, <a href=\"http://www.roundhouse.org.uk/whats-on/2016/radiohead/\">Roundhouse, London</a>.</p> <h2>Beth Orton: Kidsticks</h2> <p>Not many people would have predicted Beth Orton\u2019s next move would be to collaborate on a krautrock-inspired electropop album with one of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/19/fuck-buttons-kings-of-noise\">Fuck Buttons</a>, but we\u2019re pleased it\u2019s happened.

But the forthcoming Let the Record Show: Dexys Do Irish and Country Soul appears to be an about-turn, consisting of soulful interpretations of predominantly Irish folk standards such as Carrickfergus and Curragh of Kildare. Kevin Rowland says it\u2019s a project he has wanted to get off the ground since the mid-80s, and with typical contrariness the band tell us that it is <em>not</em> a covers album.

Their statement on the matter was terse to the point of rudeness. The appointment of Guns N\u2019 Roses leader Axl Rose as his short-term replacement will shore up ticket sales, but raises questions: how will the world\u2019s most efficient rock\u2019n\u2019roll organisation cope with having the planet\u2019s most unpredictable frontman on board? <br />\u20224 June, <a href=\"http://queenelizabetholympicpark.co.uk/whats-on/events/2015/12/acdc-at-the-stadium\">Olympic Stadium</a>, London; 9 June, Etihad Stadium, Manchester.</p> <h2>Lionel Richie</h2> <p>Has last year\u2019s Glastonbury festival revived Lionel Richie\u2019s previously somewhat cheesy reputation?

The initiative was launched formally at COP21 in Paris. AFR100 will see governments working together with regional institutions, public and private sector partners and international development programs to restore productivity to deforested and degraded landscapes, mostly through restoring forests and planting trees on agricultural land. \u201cAFR100 seeks to realize the benefits that trees can provide in African landscapes, thereby contributing to improved soil fertility and food security, improved availability and quality of water resources, reduced desertification, increased biodiversity, the creation of green jobs, economic growth, and increased capacity for climate change resilience, adaptation and mitigation,\u201d the group\u2019s mission states. Land degradation and soil erosion have real human impacts, especially on people whose livelihoods depend on agricultural productivity. Africa is thought to be most severely impacted, with 65% of arable land, 30% of grazing land and 20% of forests already lost to land degradation. In Ethiopia alone, recent estimates put the size of degraded land at over one-quarter of the entire country, which affects nearly a third of the population \u2013 some 20 million people. At a minimum, this contributes to losses of 3% of agricultural GDP. Degraded lands are also less resilient to the periodic droughts that precipitate famines. \u201c[Ethiopia is] losing so much soil because of poor land management,\u201d said Florence Landsberg, a senior associate at the World Resources Institute (WRI), an NGO. \u201cIt is not sustainable and they know it very well.\u201d In response to this challenge, Ethiopia has begun implementing programs that have restored more than 1m hectares of degraded land through community reforestation programs, better irrigation and planting trees alongside river banks to reduce erosion. The regional government of Tigray managed a campaign to reduce grazing and firewood harvest on degraded lands and build terraces on hilly agricultural lands. Now, by joining the AFR100, Ethiopia is committing to scaling up its existing efforts in order to restore 15m hectares of degraded land \u2013 an area greater than the size of England. \u201cThe government and communities realize that land degradation is affecting the growth and development of Ethiopia,\u201d says Ashebir Wondimu Zeleke, senior forestry expert at the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change of Ethiopia. \u201cThat is why the government of Ethiopia is aggressively working on mass mobilization and Ethiopian farmers are investing their free labor to restore degraded lands through integrated watershed management efforts. We need to conserve and manage our natural resources, our land [and] our ecosystem services.\u201d The interpretation of forest and landscape restoration is broad. It can cover a range of activities, including agroforestry, timber plantations for the production of fuel wood and the restoration of degraded forests. As greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere continue to break records, restoration is one way to capture carbon dioxide in the soil, trees and other vegetation. For example, restoring 15m hectares in Ethiopia could capture as much as 1.42 gigatons of CO2 \u2013 the equivalent of removing almost 300m cars from the roads for one year. Other types of restoration, such as Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, rely on trees and other plants still in the landscape. Farmers selectively prune tree stumps and protect land from grazing animals, resulting in surprising tree growth results. This type of restoration is less challenging from a biophysical perspective, but requires extensive outreach to farmers in order to achieve scale. Tevis Howard is the CEO and founder of Komaza, a Kenyan company that provides technical support to Kenyan farmers and pays farmers for raw wood before processing it into a variety of products. Like Ethiopia, Kenya has been consistently plagued by droughts, which have heavily impacted on surrounding landscape and livestock numbers. \u201cWhat used to be a sustainable ecosystem has been chopped down for charcoal and firewood, for building poles, a little for slash and burn agriculture, and then has been gobbled to bits by goats,\u201d Howard says. Komaza has already planted 2,000 hectares of trees, working with some 6,000 farmers. \u201cUntil [world] governments step up to say \u2018We value restoring land\u2019 and until there are mechanisms that [reward landowners for planting trees], the challenge is finding businesses that can get trees in the ground,\u201d Howard says. While Ethiopia and other AFR100 countries are devoting resources to the commitment, public funds are likely to be insufficient to meet the ambitious target. That\u2019s why many groups are focused on enticing the private sector to make restoration investments. \u201cWe have to develop a proof of concept for restoration models where people can earn money and it does something good for the environment,\u201d says Till Pistorius, deputy head of the climate division at international consulting firm Unique Forestry and Land Use, which provides advice on forest management and sustainable land use. In order to increase private sector financing, AFR100 has sought commitments from a number of impact investors, such as the Moringa Partnership, which invests in large-scale agroforestry projects that benefit the environment and local populations. Combined, these investors have earmarked $546m for AFR100 land restoration investments. Moringa has already put money into an agroforestry coffee project in Nicaragua, and is planning to invest tens of millions of dollars more by 2018. Moringa and others will look to invest in companies and farmers that can make money from restoration. In Ethiopia, beef, dairy, coffee, timber and firewood producers will be the primary targets for investment. Clement Chenost, investment director of Moringa Partnerships, says Moringa is looking to invest in companies that have a proven concept and an \u201cestablished a base of production\u201d. \u201cWe are not doing venture capital or pure startup. We bring capital to scale up companies and reach size and maturity.\u201d But many challenges still remain. Bureaucracy, for one. Environmental initiatives are often hampered by conflicting priorities between different ministries. The ministry of agriculture might have different plans for a piece of land than the ministry of environment, for example. \u201cWe need to work with different institutions, bilateral organizations, and restoration actors, including the private sector,\u201d Zeleke says. \u201cBringing this effort to the landscape with a common vision is not easy.\u201d This article was amended on 4 May.

      "bodyText": "Chris Hughton said last week that taking Brighton &amp; Hove Albion into the Premier League this season would be the greatest achievement of his managerial career. After this 1-1 draw with Derby County, a match rescued at the death after Brighton had been reduced to 10 men, the south coast club have given themselves a chance of doing exactly that on the final day of the season against Middlesbrough. In order to avoid the horror of joining Derby in the play-offs, Brighton will need to win at the Riverside, where Aitor Karanka\u2019s side have won 26 times this season. \u201cWe know what we have to do \u2013 we just have to show enough quality, against a really good team,\u201d Hughton said. It was always going to be a ruinously tense afternoon in the north-east, but Brighton will at least go there with the boost of rescuing this game in the fourth minute of injury time. James Wilson was the man who sent an unbearably tense Amex Stadium wild, firing into the ground then over the Derby keeper Scott Carson in a scramble from a frantic corner. \u201cIt\u2019s given us great confidence going into the last game,\u201d Wilson, the Manchester United loanee, said. \u201cGoing into the last game on a defeat is probably the worst way to do it. We have got a point so we\u2019re going up to Middlesbrough with some confidence.\u201d Hughton added: \u201cI think it will give us something. We weren\u2019t at our best, but it\u2019s still a game we didn\u2019t lose.\u201d Brighton\u2019s form has been excellent of late but despite not being at their best in this game they showed their spirit and gumption, too. In the early stages there were no signs of any, understandable, nerves in the Brighton side. Beram Kayal had their first chance, shooting from around 25 yards in the opening exchanges, denied only by a deflection. Then in the 15th minute a smart piece of defending by Jason Shackell denied Anthony Knockaert a goal from another of his brilliant free-kicks, the Derby defender retreating from the wall to head over the bar as the ball arced towards the corner of the net. Derby defended stoutly in the opening phases, but the rest of their play was disjointed, looking \u2013 as they have done for much of the season \u2013 like a collection of excellent individuals half waiting for someone else to do something. The respective midfields were a case in point: in George Thorne, Will Hughes and Craig Bryson, Derby have arguably the most talented trio in the division, and theoretically should have been too much for Brighton\u2019s duo of Kayal and Dale Stephens. Not so, as the Brighton duo controlled the early exchanges. Brighton\u2019s threat appeared to fade as the break neared, but they came within inches of taking the lead in injury time, Lewis Dunk heading just wide from a corner earned after Knockaert somehow snake-hipped his way through a clutch of three Derby defenders. The Frenchman, who might be particularly keen to avoid the play-offs after his last appearance, in which he missed a penalty for Leicester in the last minute of the 2013 semi-finals, was again Brighton\u2019s most threatening performer, as he has been since arriving in January. After the break Knockaert claimed a penalty in an incident not dissimilar to the one that won the spot-kick at Watford three years ago: Thorne lunged in, the winger tumbled, a corner was given and multiple replays cleared up not much. A busy few minutes for the referee Robert Madley then saw Tom Ince booked for an aerial challenge on Bruno, after which Chris Martin was spoken to for trying to lift the right-back from the ground, implying he was making the most of the contact. Regular watchers of Derby will appreciate that neat example of irony. Derby certainly looked more like a team who had remembered the object of all this was to score a goal or two after the break, and had three efforts on goal inside the opening four minutes, but it was not until the 71st minute that they took the lead. Hughes played a delicious ball through to Andi Weimann, who had replaced Ince moments earlier. The Austrian\u2019s initial shot was brilliantly saved by David Stockdale, but it fell straight back to the striker to side-foot into the empty net. Following logic and spending power, Derby really should be the ones scrapping for the top two rather than waiting for the play-offs, but with options like Weimann on the bench only the brave or foolish would write them off. Brighton\u2019s task at the Riverside is tricky enough, but they will have to go about it without Dunk, after the central defender was sent off in the closing stages, receiving a second booking for a heroically foolish and clumsy lunge on Bryson. His scream of frustration as he walked down the tunnel seemed to sum up Brighton\u2019s afternoon. Until Wilson popped up, that is.",

After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/02/brighton-derby-county-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">this 1-1 draw </a>with Derby County, a match rescued at the death after Brighton had been reduced to 10 men, the south coast club have given themselves a chance of doing exactly that on the final day of the season against Middlesbrough.</p> <p>In order to avoid the horror of joining Derby in the play-offs, Brighton will need to win at the Riverside, where Aitor Karanka\u2019s side have won 26 times this season.</p> <p>\u201cWe know what we have to do \u2013 we just have to show enough quality, against a really good team,\u201d Hughton said.</p> <p>It was always going to be a ruinously tense afternoon in the north-east, but Brighton will at least go there with the boost of rescuing this game in the fourth minute of injury time.</p> <p>James Wilson was the man who sent an unbearably tense Amex Stadium wild, firing into the ground then over the Derby keeper Scott Carson in a scramble from a frantic corner.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s given us great confidence going into the last game,\u201d Wilson, the Manchester United loanee, said. \u201cGoing into the last game on a defeat is probably the worst way to do it. We have got a point so we\u2019re going up to Middlesbrough with some confidence.\u201d</p> <p>Hughton added: \u201cI think it will give us something. We weren\u2019t at our best, but it\u2019s still a game we didn\u2019t lose.\u201d</p> <p>Brighton\u2019s form has been excellent of late but despite not being at their best in this game they showed their spirit and gumption, too. In the early stages there were no signs of any, understandable, nerves in the Brighton side. Beram Kayal had their first chance, shooting from around 25 yards in the opening exchanges, denied only by a deflection. Then in the 15th minute a smart piece of defending by Jason Shackell denied Anthony Knockaert a goal from another of his brilliant free-kicks, the Derby defender retreating from the wall to head over the bar as the ball arced towards the corner of the net.</p> <p>Derby defended stoutly in the opening phases, but the rest of their play was disjointed, looking \u2013 as they have done for much of the season \u2013 like a collection of excellent individuals half waiting for someone else to do something.</p> <p>The respective midfields were a case in point: in George Thorne, Will Hughes and Craig Bryson, Derby have arguably the most talented trio in the division, and theoretically should have been too much for Brighton\u2019s duo of Kayal and Dale Stephens. Not so, as the Brighton duo controlled the early exchanges.</p> <p>Brighton\u2019s threat appeared to fade as the break neared, but they came within inches of taking the lead in injury time, Lewis Dunk heading just wide from a corner earned after Knockaert somehow snake-hipped his way through a clutch of three Derby defenders. The Frenchman, who might be particularly keen to avoid the play-offs after his last appearance, in which he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/12/watford-leicester-city-championship-play-off\" title=\"\">missed a penalty for Leicester in the last minute of the 2013 semi-finals</a>, was again Brighton\u2019s most threatening performer, as he has been since arriving in January.</p> <p>After the break Knockaert claimed a penalty in an incident not dissimilar to the one that won the spot-kick at Watford three years ago: Thorne lunged in, the winger tumbled, a corner was given and multiple replays cleared up not much. A busy few minutes for the referee Robert Madley then saw Tom Ince booked for an aerial challenge on Bruno, after which Chris Martin was spoken to for trying to lift the right-back from the ground, implying he was making the most of the contact. Regular watchers of Derby will appreciate that neat example of irony.</p> <p>Derby certainly looked more like a team who had remembered the object of all this was to score a goal or two after the break, and had three efforts on goal inside the opening four minutes, but it was not until the 71st minute that they took the lead. Hughes played a delicious ball through to Andi Weimann, who had replaced Ince moments earlier. The Austrian\u2019s initial shot was brilliantly saved by David Stockdale, but it fell straight back to the striker to side-foot into the empty net.</p> <p>Following logic and spending power, Derby really should be the ones scrapping for the top two rather than waiting for the play-offs, but with options like Weimann on the bench only the brave or foolish would write them off.</p> <p>Brighton\u2019s task at the Riverside is tricky enough, but they will have to go about it without Dunk, after the central defender was sent off in the closing stages, receiving a second booking for a heroically foolish and clumsy lunge on Bryson. His scream of frustration as he walked down the tunnel seemed to sum up Brighton\u2019s afternoon. Until Wilson popped up, that is.</p>",

She was delivering the closing Arthur Miller Freedom to Write lecture of the PEN World Voices Festival. In the past, this lecture has been delivered by figures as diverse as supreme court justice Sonia Sotomayor, the novelist Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn and the essayist Christopher Hitchens. This year the honour went to the cultural critic Gay. PEN American executive director Suzanne Nossel introduced her as someone who \u201cmay be a Bad Feminist, but a perfect Arthur Miller Freedom to Write lecturer\u201d, in reference to the Gay\u2019s popular book of feminist essays. Sitting onstage, dressed in a plain dark shirt, Gay began by thanking the audience for turning up in the rain, \u201cbut then I thought I\u2019d talk to you about Beyonc\u00e9\u201d.

Though often the \u201cfreedom to write\u201d is considered in the context of writers around the world in perilous positions, Gay brought the evening\u2019s discussion to the personal obstacles involved.

Gay, who described herself \u201ctaking up a lot of space\u201d, has publicly chronicled her battles with her body. \u201cIt would be easy to pretend I am just fine with my body as it is \u2013 I am a feminist after all,\u201d she said after an evocative passage in which she described her body as a cage, \u201cand I believe in diverse body types \u2013 but then I have to leave my apartment and face the world.\u201d Gay was raped as a 12-year-old. \u201cThe past is written on my body,\u201d she said, talking further about how she often denied herself many basic pleasures such as wearing bright colors because she \u201cdid not feel I had the right\u201d. Gay closed her speech by describing the self-compassion she does allow herself \u201ceven though the world thinks I should [hate myself]\u201d. \u201cThe truth makes me uncomfortable too,\u201d she said of her body, \u201cbut I\u2019m also saying here\u2019s my heart \u2013 what\u2019s left of it.\u201d Saeed Jones, Buzzfeed\u2019s executive editor for culture, then joined \u201cQueen Roxane\u201d for a conversation about separating valid criticism from human beings, and not being put on a pedestal. \u201cSomeone critiqued one paragraph from the publishing marketing copy,\u201d Gay said, referring to a review she\u2019d found online, even though she had not herself turned in the manuscript yet.

Gay also spoke of her belief that Beyonc\u00e9 brought peers whose bodies had been shamed into her Lemonade videos, as \u201cmoney has never bought a black person freedom from being a target\u201d. The topic of literary gatekeepers was also raised. \u201cWhen white men write about themselves, people are like, oh my god that\u2019s groundbreaking, like Knausgaard.

    "webTitle": "Alyson Bailes obituary", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Alyson Bailes, who has died aged 67 of cancer, worked for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for 33 years, both in London and as a diplomat in Hungary, West Germany, China, Norway and Belgium. She was British ambassador to Finland, 2000-02. However, as she herself put it, she \u201ckept escaping for career breaks and different perspectives\u201d. Her secondments included posts with the Ministry of Defence in London and Nato in Brussels. She was very proud of her work on Nato enlargement into eastern Europe, which she considered to be a major contribution to peace and stability. She was never ambitious for rank for its own sake and her leadership of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute from 2002 until 2007, and her recent teaching roles, at the University of Iceland and the College of Europe, gave her the greatest satisfaction and achievement. Her flair for languages was remarkable. She spoke and read French, Hungarian, German, Mandarin Chinese, Norwegian, Finnish and Swedish at what she herself described as \u201can operational level\u201d. She also had reading knowledge of Danish, Icelandic, Faroese and Dutch. Sir Kim Darroch, British ambassador in Washington, describes her as \u201calways the cleverest person in the room, and sometimes, when she was bored, she would admit to having been translating something from Hungarian into Mandarin just as a mental exercise to keep her brain occupied\u201d. He also noted Alyson\u2019s steadiness and calmness: \u201cI never saw her get angry or flustered. She was always extremely kind and never gave the impression of thinking ill of anybody.\u201d This calmness under fire was tested in March 1979 when she was sitting next to the British ambassador Sir Richard Sykes when he was shot dead by Irish terrorists outside his home in The Hague. It was only by chance that she was in the ambassador\u2019s car, as she had travelled to The Hague for meetings with Sir Edmund Dell and his team of \u201cThree Wise Men\u201d appointed by the European council to advise on institutional improvements in the European community before Greek accession. Alyson went on to speak at a press conference about the incident at the British embassy, then resumed her planned programme of meetings. The eldest of three children of Barbara (nee Martin) and John-Lloyd Bailes, both of whom were teachers, Alyson was born in Liverpool and educated at the Belvedere school in the city. She went to Somerville College, Oxford, in 1966, aged 17, with a scholarship to read modern history, and graduated in 1969 with a first. In 2001 she was made an honorary fellow of the college. She joined the Foreign Office as a junior diplomat in September 1969, having achieved full marks in the entrance exam. It was a very different world from today. All ambassadors were men (the first British female ambassador was appointed in 1976). Alyson\u2019s duties as a junior diplomat included carrying coals for the open hearth fire which heated the office; and writing up policy documents in pen and ink, which would be copied out by typists using carbon paper. With her customary dry humour, she noted that \u201cit was considered a sign of unusual keenness to arrive in the office before 10\u201d. A month after joining the FCO, she was interviewed by the Sunday Times and was asked whether there would ever be a female British ambassador? Would Alyson be Her Excellency in 20 years\u2019 time? She replied that she couldn\u2019t begin to imagine herself being that old: \u201cBut I suppose, by the time I am, I might be wanting to be an ambassador.\u201d In fact it was 30 years later that she took up her post as ambassador to Finland. By then there had been a dozen female ambassadors and high commissioners, but it was still relatively uncommon for a woman to get a top post in Europe. Now numbers have risen to more than 30 in top posts. Darroch believes Alyson could have been an ambassador earlier \u201cif she had pushed herself more and played office politics.\u201d. As an expert on global defence issues, from 2011 until 2014 she was a member of the Trident Commission on UK nuclear weapons policy established by the thinktank BASIC. Its co-chair, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former foreign secretary, said: \u201cVery often you find that people who have been diplomats all their lives have become so used to giving a diplomatic answer on behalf of the government that they can\u2019t do anything else. Alyson was different ... She didn\u2019t just give an opinion; she was always trying to make progress to bring the two sides closer together and she had the skills to do this.\u201d As well as funny, generous and thoughtful, Alyson was interesting and interested, not only in diplomacy and international relations, but also in sci-fi (both books and films), embroidery, singing in choirs wherever she was posted, the novels of Dorothy Dunnett (she wrote articles for the Dorothy Dunnett Society), Icelandic heavy metal music and, most recently, heavy metal music from the Faroe Islands. This last was not an interest shared by her many friends. She is survived by her mother, her brother, Martin, and her sister, Jane. \u2022 Alyson Judith Kirtley Bailes, diplomat and political scientist, born 6 April 1949; died 29 April 2016",

She was very proud of her work on Nato enlargement into eastern Europe, which she considered to be a major contribution to peace and stability.</p> <p>She was never ambitious for rank for its own sake and her leadership of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute from 2002 until 2007, and her recent teaching roles, at the University of Iceland and the College of Europe, gave her the greatest satisfaction and achievement.</p> <p>Her flair for languages was remarkable. She spoke and read French, Hungarian, German, Mandarin Chinese, Norwegian, Finnish and Swedish at what she herself described as \u201can operational level\u201d. She also had reading knowledge of Danish, Icelandic, Faroese and Dutch. Sir Kim Darroch, British ambassador in Washington, describes her as \u201calways the cleverest person in the room, and sometimes, when she was bored, she would admit to having been translating something from Hungarian into Mandarin just as a mental exercise to keep her brain occupied\u201d.</p> <p>He also noted Alyson\u2019s steadiness and calmness: \u201cI never saw her get angry or flustered. She was always extremely kind and never gave the impression of thinking ill of anybody.\u201d This calmness under fire was tested in March 1979 when she was sitting next to the British ambassador Sir Richard Sykes when he was shot dead by Irish terrorists outside his home in The Hague. It was only by chance that she was in the ambassador\u2019s car, as she had travelled to The Hague for meetings with <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-edmund-dell-1122292.html\" title=\"\">Sir Edmund Dell</a> and his team of \u201cThree Wise Men\u201d appointed by the European council to advise on institutional improvements in the European community before Greek accession. Alyson went on to speak at a press conference about the incident at the British embassy, then resumed her planned programme of meetings.</p> <p>The eldest of three children of Barbara (nee Martin) and John-Lloyd Bailes, both of whom were teachers, Alyson was born in Liverpool and educated at the Belvedere school in the city. She went to Somerville College, Oxford, in 1966, aged 17, with a scholarship to read modern history, and graduated in 1969 with a first. In 2001 she was made an honorary fellow of the college.</p> <p>She joined the Foreign Office as a junior diplomat in September 1969, having achieved full marks in the entrance exam. It was a very different world from today. All ambassadors were men (the first British female ambassador was appointed in 1976). Alyson\u2019s duties as a junior diplomat included carrying coals for the open hearth fire which heated the office; and writing up policy documents in pen and ink, which would be copied out by typists using carbon paper. With her customary dry humour, she noted that \u201cit was considered a sign of unusual keenness to arrive in the office before 10\u201d.</p> <p>A month after joining the FCO, she was interviewed by the Sunday Times and was asked whether there would ever be a female British ambassador? Would Alyson be Her Excellency in 20 years\u2019 time? She replied that she couldn\u2019t begin to imagine herself being that old: \u201cBut I suppose, by the time I am, I might be wanting to be an ambassador.\u201d</p> <p>In fact it was 30 years later that she took up her post as ambassador to Finland. By then there had been a dozen female ambassadors and high commissioners, but it was still relatively uncommon for a woman to get a top post in Europe. Now numbers have risen to more than 30 in top posts. Darroch believes Alyson could have been an ambassador earlier \u201cif she had pushed herself more and played office politics.\u201d.</p> <p>As an expert on global defence issues, from 2011 until 2014 she was a member of the Trident Commission on UK nuclear weapons policy established by the thinktank BASIC. Its co-chair, <a href=\"https://malcolmrifkind.com/\" title=\"\">Sir Malcolm Rifkind</a>, the former foreign secretary, said: \u201cVery often you find that people who have been diplomats all their lives have become so used to giving a diplomatic answer on behalf of the government that they can\u2019t do anything else. Alyson was different ... She didn\u2019t just give an opinion; she was always trying to make progress to bring the two sides closer together and she had the skills to do this.\u201d</p> <p>As well as funny, generous and thoughtful, Alyson was interesting and interested, not only in diplomacy and international relations, but also in sci-fi (both books and films), embroidery, singing in choirs wherever she was posted, the novels of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/nov/15/guardianobituaries.books\" title=\"\">Dorothy Dunnett</a> (she wrote articles for the Dorothy Dunnett Society), Icelandic heavy metal music and, most recently, heavy metal music from the Faroe Islands. This last was not an interest shared by her many friends.</p> <p>She is survived by her mother, her brother, Martin, and her sister, Jane.</p> <p>\u2022 Alyson Judith Kirtley Bailes, diplomat and political scientist, born 6 April 1949; died 29 April 2016</p>",

      "bodyText": "A View from Islington North Political satire, long dormant, returns with five angry pieces from Caryl Churchill, David Hare, Mark Ravenhill, Alistair Beaton and Stella Feehily, all directed by Max Stafford-Clark. Let\u2019s hope it puts a rocket under the current ruinously incompetent regime. \u202218 May to 2 July, Arts theatre, London. Box office: 020-7836 8463. Richard III Ralph Fiennes, who has recently reached new heights as an actor in Shaw and Ibsen, takes on the challenge of playing Shakespeare\u2019s Machiavellian monarch. It will also be exciting to see him partnered by Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Margaret, who was a memorable Volumnia in Fiennes\u2019 film of Coriolanus. Rupert Goold directs and faces the challenge of making Shakespeare\u2019s history play as rivetingly clear as he did Mike Bartlett\u2019s King Charles III. \u20227 June to 6 August, Almeida, London. Box office: 020-7359 4404. Phaedra(s) The incomparable Isabelle Huppert returns to the London stage for the first time in 20 years in this story of a woman who burns with desire for her stepson. This production, already seen in Paris, is the work of Polish hotshot Krzysztof Warlikowski and is largely based on the text of Sarah Kane\u2019s Phaedra\u2019s Love, with a little help from JM Coetzee and Wajdi Mouawad. \u20229 to 18 June, Barbican, London. Box office: 0845-120 7511. On Corporation Street Twenty years ago, the provisional IRA launched a devastating attack on Manchester in the largest bombing ever seen in mainland Britain. The event is recalled in a piece that is largely the work of the acclaimed experimental Irish company ANU. Using personal memories and mixing live action, visual art and film footage, it promises to be both painful and provocative. \u202210 to 25 June, Home, Manchester. Box office: 0161-200 1500. Groundhog Day Can lightning strike twice in the same place? This musical version of the 1993 movie about a grumpy TV weatherman stuck in a time loop reunites many of the team behind Matilda, including composer and lyricist Tim Minchin, director Matthew Warchus, choreographer Peter Darling and designer Rob Howell. Already the show is inked in for Broadway. \u2022 11 July to 17 September, Old Vic, London. Box office: 0844-871 7628. Fracked! Or Please Don\u2019t Use the F-Word Alistair Beaton has seized on the fact that drilling for shale gas in picturesque villages has sparked fierce middle-class protest. That is the starting point for what promises to be a hotly topical black comedy with a cast headed by James Bolam, Anne Reid and the original angry old man, Richard Wilson, directing. \u2022 8 July to 6 August, Minerva, Chichester. Box office: 01243 781 312. Young Chekhov One of the great events of last year was this Chichester staging of a Chekhov trilogy of Platonov, Ivanov and The Seagull, in new versions by David Hare. Now Jonathan Kent\u2019s breathtaking production moves to London with a fine cast including Anna Chancellor, Olivia Vinall, James McArdle and Geoffrey Streatfeild. See the trilogy in one day if you can. \u202214 July to 3 September, Olivier, London. Box office: 020-7452 3000. King Lear Antony Sher plays the king in Gregory Doran\u2019s keenly awaited staging of Shakespeare\u2019s flawed masterpiece. It\u2019s already been a year of Lears, with Michael Pennington and Don Warrington having played the part and Timothy West and Glenda Jackson still to come. Sher, who has recently played Arthur Miller\u2019s tragic hero in Death of a Salesman, seems equipped for an assault on the summit. \u2022 20 August to 15 October, Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon. Box office: 01789 403 493. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Our hero is now grownup, works for the Ministry of Magic and finds his past comes back to haunt him. Jack Thorne\u2019s two-part play is adapted from a JK Rowling story, directed by John Tiffany and is sure to be the summer\u2019s theatrical talking point. Jamie Parker, Noma Dumezweni and Paul Thornley star as the adult Harry, Hermione and Ron. \u2022 Opens 7 June, Palace theatre, London. Box office: 0844-412 4656. Anything That Gives Off Light Self-interest and sacrifice are under the microscope in the latest show from the massively talented Brooklyn-based ensemble, The Team. The company are masters at excavating and smashing myths and this world premiere uses live Scottish and American folk music as the lives of a Scottish man and an American woman collide on a tour of the Highlands. \u202216 to 26 August, Edinburgh International Conference Centre, as part of the Edinburgh international festival. Box office: 0131-300 3000. The Flying Lovers of Vitebsk Love, life, politics and art are entwined in Daniel Jamieson\u2019s look at the relationship of Marc and Bella Chagall, who lived through some of the most tumultuous events of the 20th century. Using the visual language of Marc Chagall\u2019s famed paintings, Emma Rice\u2019s final production as director of Kneehigh should be marked by all the passion and playfulness that distinguished her greatest productions for the company, including The Red Shoes and Tristan and Yseult. \u202227 May to 11 June, Bristol Old Vic. Box office: 0117-949 3993. Then touring. The Entertainer The Kenneth Branagh season concludes with the man himself following in the well-trodden footsteps of Laurence Olivier, playing John Osborne\u2019s titular hero. It is far and way Osborne\u2019s best play, in that it uses a broken-down music-hall comedian as the symbol of a Britain in crisis after the disastrous Suez invasion of 1956. In fact, the play might well have been titled Lost Empires. \u2022 20 August to 12 November, Garrick theatre, London. Box office: 0330-333 4811. The Night Watch Sarah Waters\u2019s novel, set both during the blitz and after, is a delicate thing \u2013 a spider\u2019s web of interconnecting stories that explore secrets and evasions as explosive as any buried bomb. Writer Hattie Naylor should be more than capable of exploiting all its potential in a production directed by Rebecca Gatward. \u202219 May to 18 June, Royal Exchange, Manchester. Box office: 0161-833 9833. Stella Neil Bartlett has always been a theatre-maker in love with the illusions and masks of theatre itself, but also capable of exposing what lies beneath. So he should be perfectly placed to ask what it really means to be yourself in this world premiere, which is inspired by the life and death of Ernest Boulton, one half of the Victorian cross-dressing duo, Fanny and Stella. \u202227 and 28 May, Theatre Royal, Brighton. Box office: 0844-871 7650. Then at Lift, London. Peter Pan in Scarlet What happened to the Lost Boys in Peter Pan when they grew up? Geraldine McCaughrean\u2019s highly acclaimed sequel fast forwards to 1929 and explores just that. There is probably nobody better to make it fly onstage than Theresa Heskins, who has created a string of highly imaginative, form-breaking shows, many of them for family audiences. Expect great storytelling, innovative aerial work, and a sprinkling of fairy dust. \u202223 July to 6 August, New Vic, Newcastle under Lyme. Box office: 01782 717 962. Then touring. The Toad Knew James Thi\u00e9rr\u00e9e is a theatrical magician, born into the world of circus, but creating large-scale shows that cross art-forms. Dancers, contortionists, and high-wire walkers are called into service for Thi\u00e9rr\u00e9e\u2019s latest piece, following five people bound together by blood and emotional ties. Expect it to be flamboyant, hallucinatory and ravishingly beautiful. \u202224 to 28 August, King\u2019s theatre, Edinburgh, as part of the Edinburgh international festival. Box office: 0131 529 6000. Imaginate festival This festival is a treasure, one that regularly brings some of the world\u2019s best children\u2019s theatre to the UK, while celebrating the best we have to offer. Look out for dance-theatre piece Constellations from Spain; magic-inspired The Great Illusionist from The Netherlands; and Broken Dreams from Belgium, which offers a repair service for your unfulfilled dreams. \u202228 May to 5 June, various venues, Edinburgh. Box office: 0131-225 8050. Place des Anges First seen in the UK in Piccadilly Circus in 2012, this French spectacle, which takes place at dusk, is the closing event in the Yorkshire festival. Angels are suddenly spotted high up on buildings and, as they glide towards the audience, the sky fills with a blizzard of feathers. It\u2019s a terrific experience, playful and wondrous, and the miracle is that something so simple completely transforms the crowd\u2019s relationship with each other and a familiar location. \u20222 July, Queens Gardens, Hull. Book here. Yorkshire festival runs 16 June to 3 July.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The shadowy Whitehall unit at the heart of the British government\u2019s covert strategic communications campaign was inspired by a clandestine cold war propaganda programme. But while the cold war offensive targeted communism, trade unionists and newspapers in developing countries, the current operations are aimed at Muslims, both in Britain and the Middle East. The British-based element of the campaign is part of the Prevent counter-radicalisation programme and is run by the Home Office\u2019s Research, Information and Communications Unit, or Ricu. Ricu officials dislike the word propaganda: they prefer the term strategic communications. The extraordinary ambitions of these communications are set out in Ricu documents seen by the Guardian. \u201cStrategic communications aims to effect behavioural and attitudinal change,\u201d says one paper. For almost two years Ricu\u2019s focus has been on Islamic State, whose own online propaganda has proven powerful. Isis is calculated to be posting an average of 18 messages a day, many of them showing not violence, but flowers, forests and flowing streams, to emphasise the natural beauty of the territory under its control. To counter this, Ricu says privately that it is working \u201cat an industrial scale and pace\u201d. While it does produce some government-branded communications, the key to its counter-radicalisation messages is that they are disseminated through \u201cdiscreet campaigns supported by Ricu without any acknowledgment of UK government support\u201d. It uses YouTube, Twitter and Facebook as well as more traditional propaganda methods, such as feeding stories to newspapers, including the Guardian, and leafleting. Under the umbrella of Prevent Ricu is based in the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT), in the Home Office\u2019s Westminster HQ. Charles Farr, a former MI6 officer and head of the OSCT, set up the unit shortly after arriving at the Home Office in 2007. Ricu was modelled on the Information Research Department (IRD), a propaganda unit established in 1948 by the Attlee government. The IRD\u2019s exploits included hoodwinking journalists and academics and targeting trade unionists, before it was shut down in 1977. Farr told MPs that the new unit had two functions: advising officials \u201cfrom a brigade commander in Helmand province through to a chief constable in Yorkshire\u201d on the language they should use to describe terrorism and the government\u2019s response; and challenging the propaganda of al-Qaida and others. Some of the unit\u2019s funding came from the budget for Prevent, the controversial counter-radicalisation programme. This funding has risen steeply: for 2015-16, the unit\u2019s budget was \u00a317m, more than five times as much as three years earlier. Ricu has hired linguists, psychologists and anthropologists as well as counter-terrorism strategists, digital media experts, film-makers and marketing consultants. It has three divisions: a monitoring and coordination team to watch and study digital and traditional media; an insight and analysis team to research audience reactions; and a domestic and international campaigns team to deliver the covert propaganda. When the Home Office revised Prevent in June 2011, it declared that Ricu\u2019s impact had been \u201cvariable\u201d, and that more effort to \u201cidentify credible partners\u201d and develop powerful narratives and \u201cmore professional counter-narrative products\u201d was needed. The following January, the home secretary, Theresa May, informed the intelligence and security committee that Ricu was \u201croad-testing some quite innovative approaches to counter-ideological messages\u201d. By the end of the year, the unit had a new head, Richard Chalk. A former Conservative parliamentary candidate and communications chief, Chalk arrived after working in Baghdad for Bell Pottinger, the British PR firm. That work \u2013 some of which remains classified \u2013 included \u201cinformation operations\u201d intended to help undermine the insurgency. On his return to the UK he became chief of staff for the then Tory party co-chair, Sayeeda Warsi. The Home Office says he was hired to head Ricu because of his expertise in counter-terrorism strategic communications. Under Chalk\u2019s leadership, Ricu began communicating with British Muslims in a manner more reminiscent of counter-insurgency operations than a traditional public information campaign: disseminating messages through the use of subterfuge. Delivering the propaganda Much of the work is outsourced. Ricu\u2019s favoured contractor is Breakthrough Media Network Ltd, a company operating from an anonymous office block near Waterloo station in central London. Nothing inside, other than a series of locked doors and CCTV cameras, suggests the nature of the company\u2019s work. Like Chalk, one of Breakthrough\u2019s two directors, Scott Brown, worked for the Conservatives before joining Bell Pottinger\u2019s information operations team in Baghdad. The other, Robert Elliott, is a former reality TV producer. Both are in their 30s and attended the same school in Essex. Working under contract to Ricu, Breakthrough produces masses of digital material \u2013 films, Twitter feeds, Facebook profiles, YouTube clips, online radio content and websites. It says these are often \u201chosted\u201d by Muslim civil society groups. One Breakthrough document seen by the Guardian explains that its objective is to \u201cinfluence online conversations by being embedded within target communities via a network of moderate organisations that are supportive of it\u2019s [sic] goals\u201d. While at least one entity Ricu has used to disseminate its messages \u2013 Help for Syria \u2013 has been designed for a specific counter-radicalisation message by Breakthrough, it usually works with groups that already exist. One person familiar with Ricu\u2019s work says that such groups are monitored closely before any approach is made. Sometimes, the source added, they are very small. \u201cIt could be just some guy with a blog, but it was always someone HMG [Her Majesty\u2019s government] could work with. It\u2019s not a genuine partnership, however: it\u2019s a manipulative arrangement.\u201d Ricu does not fund these groups, instead funding Breakthrough\u2019s work to produce these groups\u2019 communications. Some of the groups with which Breakthrough works on Ricu\u2019s behalf insist they retain editorial control and that Ricu and Breakthrough\u2019s help amplifies their messages. Privately, however, Breakthrough says it is providing \u201cRicu with effective ways of communicating its own messages through credible civil society organisations\u201d. Ricu\u2019s briefing notes are even clearer about who is in charge: \u201cWhilst retaining editorial control over all Ricu-produced material, Ricu provides a range of support and expertise to CSOs [civil society organisations] to help them shape campaigns, produce products and mobilise their stakeholders.\u201d As of February last year, according to one document, the unit had run 13 national campaigns, producing a total of 950 physical and online products, which had been accessed by audiences more than a million times. Chalk is an occasional visitor to Breakthrough\u2019s offices. One source said: \u201cSometimes he sits in the edit suites, watching the work. It\u2019s not exactly scripted by Ricu, but they\u2019ll make it clear that they want a particular form of words to be used at a particular point in a film.\u201d A Breakthrough source said that as the government was paying for the contract, Ricu was within its rights to visit the edit suite to check the quality of the work. Ricu and Breakthrough focus on \u201cPrevent priority areas\u201d in the UK, using keywords and paid-for Google and Facebook adverts to target people whose browsing history suggests they are Muslims. Using so-called \u201cpromotion and diversion techniques\u201d, Breakthrough promotes Ricu\u2019s messages to browsers who are searching for terms such as Isis, Khalifa and \u201cWhat does the Qur\u2019an say about jihad?\u201d. Last year, Breakthrough set up a public relations company, Horizon PR, as a joint enterprise with M&amp;C Saatchi. \u201cHorizon was created to support the public relations of civil society groups, voluntary organisations and NGOs [non-governmental organisations] who want to drive positive social change,\u201d a Saatchi spokesman said. Horizon has promoted the work of community groups as part of Breakthrough\u2019s contract with Ricu. Journalists contacted by Horizon have not been told that the company was representing the groups as part of the Ricu contract. Breakthrough is understood to say that there was no obligation to disclose the government\u2019s involvement. Breakthrough says in one document that it \u201cunderstands the sensitive nature of Ricu\u2019s work and adheres to the highest standards of security and confidentiality\u201d. Were Ricu\u2019s involvement to be exposed, there would be a negative impact not only on the credibility of the messages, but on \u201cRicu, Prevent and the Home Office\u2019s reputation\u201d. The purpose of this work, Breakthrough makes clear, is to help the British government \u201cpromote a reconciled British Muslim identity\u201d while keeping its involvement hidden, as \u201cany content or messaging attributed to the state are highly unlikely to have any credibility among these audiences\u201d. To achieve the government\u2019s aim, Ricu is attempting to change the way young British Muslims think and act: time and again the documents talk about \u201cimplementing attitudinal and behavioural change communications\u201d; \u201cmeasurable attitudinal change outcomes\u201d; and \u201ccampaigns designed to deliver real attitudinal and behavioural change\u201d. \u2018They\u2019re not what they seem\u2019 Breakthrough has contracts with several non-governmental bodies and has been transparent about governmental support for communications campaigns in east Africa. But several sources say its work for Ricu dwarfs its other operations. Breakthrough\u2019s relationship with the unit is lucrative. In 2012-13, the firm received \u00a3448,286 from its contracts with the OSCT. By 2013-14, this had increased to \u00a35,911,719. In total, the company has earned \u00a311.8m from the OSCT since 2012. One person with knowledge of Ricu\u2019s work said some freelancers working with Breakthrough do not appear to know they are engaged in covert propaganda. Several former Breakthrough employees, both freelance and staff, told the Guardian they had not heard of Ricu \u2013 a suggestion Breakthrough is understood to contest. One former employee said she left after realising she was working on propaganda because she considered the work to be \u201cstupid and reprehensible\u201d. Another, a freelance, said she realised the connection after Breakthrough managers repeatedly requested editing changes. \u201cIt became obvious that it was being directed from outside the company. It was a slightly more shadowy process. I asked where the money was coming from and they said the Home Office. I was uneasy enough to get out. They are not what they seem.\u201d The Home Office refused to answer questions about Ricu\u2019s work and would not permit anyone from the unit to be interviewed. It would not comment on the extent of the home secretary\u2019s oversight of Ricu; nor would it respond to suggestions that its covert support for Muslim organisations risks undermining support from Muslim civil society as a whole. It issued a statement, however, saying it was working with communities, civil society groups and individuals to counter the \u201ctwisted narrative\u201d of terrorists and extremists. \u201cWe are proud of the support Ricu has provided to organisations working on the frontline to challenge the warped ideology of groups such as Daesh [Isis], and to protect communities,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis work can involve sensitive issues, vulnerable communities and hard-to-reach audiences, and it has been important to build relationships out of the media glare. We respect the bravery of individuals and organisations who choose to speak out against violence and extremism and it is right that we support and protect them. \u201cOur guiding principle has to be whether or not any organisation we work with is itself happy to talk publicly about what they do. At the same time we are as open as we can be and have referenced the role of Ricu in publications and in parliament.\u201d Unlike Ricu, Breakthrough did provide answers to the Guardian\u2019s questions but said it regarded those answers as confidential and not for publication. In a statement, it said: \u201cBreakthrough Media is enormously proud to be able to provide a wide range of community groups with the help and support they need to tell their stories, confront extremism in all its forms and build stronger, safer communities.\u201d Officials who are familiar with the work told the Guardian that it was a good and valuable effort. One person involved acknowledged that the work amounted to propaganda but added: \u201cAll we\u2019re trying to do is stop people becoming suicide bombers.\u201d Reporting team: Ian Cobain, Alice Ross, Rob Evans, Mona Mahmood, Nick Fielding and Safak Timur",

The extraordinary ambitions of these communications are set out in Ricu documents seen by the Guardian. \u201cStrategic communications aims to effect behavioural and attitudinal change,\u201d says one paper.<br /></p> <p>For almost two years Ricu\u2019s focus has been on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/05/islamic-state-trains-purer-child-killers-in-doctrine-of-hate\">Islamic State, whose own online propaganda has proven powerful</a>. Isis is calculated to be posting <a href=\"http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/445/html\">an average of 18 messages a day</a>, many of them showing not violence, but flowers, forests and flowing streams, to emphasise the natural beauty of the territory under its control. To counter this, Ricu says privately that it is working \u201cat an industrial scale and pace\u201d.</p> <p>While it does produce some government-branded communications, the key to its counter-radicalisation messages is that they are disseminated through \u201cdiscreet campaigns supported by Ricu without any acknowledgment of UK government support\u201d.</p> <p>It uses YouTube, Twitter and Facebook as well as more traditional propaganda methods, such as feeding stories to newspapers, including the Guardian, and leafleting.</p> <h2>Under the umbrella of Prevent</h2> <p>Ricu is based in the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT), in the Home Office\u2019s Westminster HQ. Charles Farr, a former MI6 officer and head of the OSCT, set up the unit shortly after arriving at the Home Office in 2007.</p> <p>Ricu was modelled on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/sep/24/bbc.uknews\">Information Research Department</a> (IRD), a propaganda unit established in 1948 by the Attlee government. The IRD\u2019s exploits included hoodwinking journalists and academics and targeting trade unionists, before it was shut down in 1977.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"83732d13a333694963ccc008be882996a8dd8419\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83732d13a333694963ccc008be882996a8dd8419/448_0_965_1192/810.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Farr gives evidence to the home affairs select committee.\" width=\"810\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charles Farr gives evidence to the home affairs select committee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmhaff/212/09022602.htm\">Farr told MPs</a> that the new unit had two functions: advising officials \u201cfrom a brigade commander in Helmand province through to a chief constable in Yorkshire\u201d on the language they should use to describe terrorism and the government\u2019s response; and challenging the propaganda of al-Qaida and others.</p> <p>Some of the unit\u2019s funding came from the budget for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/97976/prevent-strategy-review.pdf\">Prevent, the controversial counter-radicalisation programme</a>. This funding has risen steeply: for 2015-16, the unit\u2019s budget was \u00a317m, more than five times as much as three years earlier.</p> <p>Ricu has hired linguists, psychologists and anthropologists as well as counter-terrorism strategists, digital media experts, film-makers and marketing consultants. It has three divisions: a monitoring and coordination team to watch and study digital and traditional media; an insight and analysis team to research audience reactions; and a domestic and international campaigns team to deliver the covert propaganda.</p> <p>When the Home Office revised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/03/prevent-strategy-sowing-mistrust-fear-muslim-communities\">Prevent </a>in June 2011, it declared that Ricu\u2019s impact had been \u201cvariable\u201d, and that more effort to \u201cidentify credible partners\u201d and develop powerful narratives and \u201cmore professional counter-narrative products\u201d was needed.</p> <p>The following January, the home secretary, Theresa May, informed the <a href=\"https://b1cba9b3-a-5e6631fd-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/independent.gov.uk/isc/files/2011-2012_ISC_AR.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cpaE3U7FSNlWgQkThK_IcLBt-oNAHRRfkA7OWh0i7YYGHmLXJEQqzaXc-c4-jT4syBSebTmTDxEmmlEUClMdcUK8bfwA-daY3qfD05KntlhT8n59PZHQKg6fL4obYrfdGFFsL9CMRGABKFmwtMwtj49FeESr0xRYBV3NzOBnrDMMdI0bbhjdKWNpfzlM6IBbqJRCapGr6iOUXpx2SS_26CBzDO2TWMW0KWFcFXzMA6zfrZzkcI%3D&amp;attredirects=1\">intelligence and security committee</a> that Ricu was \u201croad-testing some quite innovative approaches to counter-ideological messages\u201d.</p> <p>By the end of the year, the unit had a new head, Richard Chalk. A former Conservative parliamentary candidate and communications chief, Chalk arrived after working in Baghdad for Bell Pottinger, the British PR firm. That work \u2013 some of which remains classified \u2013 included \u201cinformation operations\u201d intended to help undermine the insurgency.</p> <p>On his return to the UK he became chief of staff for the then Tory party co-chair, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/11/sayeeda-warsi-former-conservative-chair-interview\">Sayeeda Warsi</a>. The Home Office says he was hired to head Ricu because of his expertise in counter-terrorism strategic communications.</p> <p>Under Chalk\u2019s leadership, Ricu began communicating with British Muslims in a manner more reminiscent of counter-insurgency operations than a traditional public information campaign: disseminating messages through the use of subterfuge.</p> <h2>Delivering the propaganda</h2> <p>Much of the work is outsourced. Ricu\u2019s favoured contractor is Breakthrough Media Network Ltd, a company operating from an anonymous office block near Waterloo station in central London. Nothing inside, other than a series of locked doors and CCTV cameras, suggests the nature of the company\u2019s work.</p> <p>Like Chalk, one of Breakthrough\u2019s two directors, Scott Brown, worked for the Conservatives before joining Bell Pottinger\u2019s information operations team in Baghdad. The other, Robert Elliott, is a former reality TV producer. Both are in their 30s and attended the same school in Essex.</p> <p>Working under contract to Ricu, Breakthrough produces masses of digital material \u2013 films, Twitter feeds, Facebook profiles, YouTube clips, online radio content and websites. It says these are often \u201chosted\u201d by Muslim civil society groups.</p> <p>One Breakthrough document seen by the Guardian explains that its objective is to \u201cinfluence online conversations by being embedded within target communities via a network of moderate organisations that are supportive of it\u2019s [sic] goals\u201d.</p> <p>While at least one entity Ricu has used to disseminate its messages \u2013 Help for Syria \u2013 has been designed for a specific counter-radicalisation message by Breakthrough, it usually works with groups that already exist.</p> <p>One person familiar with Ricu\u2019s work says that such groups are monitored closely before any approach is made. Sometimes, the source added, they are very small. \u201cIt could be just some guy with a blog, but it was always someone HMG [Her Majesty\u2019s government] could work with. It\u2019s not a genuine partnership, however: it\u2019s a manipulative arrangement.\u201d</p> <p>Ricu does not fund these groups, instead funding Breakthrough\u2019s work to produce these groups\u2019 communications. Some of the groups with which Breakthrough works on Ricu\u2019s behalf insist they retain editorial control and that Ricu and Breakthrough\u2019s help amplifies their messages.</p> <p>Privately, however, Breakthrough says it is providing \u201cRicu with effective ways of communicating its own messages through credible civil society organisations\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"623969365feeae9f9a711949ef489c1be86a7101\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/623969365feeae9f9a711949ef489c1be86a7101/12_390_3146_1887/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pro-Isis demonstrators in Mosul, Iraq\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pro-Isis demonstrators in Mosul, Iraq. Ricu is aimed at preventing young British Muslims from falling into the militants\u2019 hands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ricu\u2019s briefing notes are even clearer about who is in charge: \u201cWhilst retaining editorial control over all Ricu-produced material, Ricu provides a range of support and expertise to CSOs [civil society organisations] to help them shape campaigns, produce products and mobilise their stakeholders.\u201d</p> <p>As of February last year, according to one document, the unit had run 13 national campaigns, producing a total of 950 physical and online products, which had been accessed by audiences more than a million times.</p> <p>Chalk is an occasional visitor to Breakthrough\u2019s offices. One source said: \u201cSometimes he sits in the edit suites, watching the work. It\u2019s not exactly scripted by Ricu, but they\u2019ll make it clear that they want a particular form of words to be used at a particular point in a film.\u201d A Breakthrough source said that as the government was paying for the contract, Ricu was within its rights to visit the edit suite to check the quality of the work.</p> <p>Ricu and Breakthrough focus on \u201cPrevent priority areas\u201d in the UK, using keywords and paid-for Google and Facebook adverts to target people whose browsing history suggests they are Muslims. Using so-called \u201cpromotion and diversion techniques\u201d, Breakthrough promotes Ricu\u2019s messages to browsers who are searching for terms such as Isis, Khalifa and \u201cWhat does the Qur\u2019an say about jihad?\u201d.</p> <p>Last year, Breakthrough set up a public relations company, Horizon PR, as a joint enterprise with M&amp;C Saatchi. \u201cHorizon was created to support the public relations of civil society groups, voluntary organisations and NGOs [non-governmental organisations] who want to drive positive social change,\u201d a Saatchi spokesman said.</p> <p>Horizon has promoted the work of community groups as part of Breakthrough\u2019s contract with Ricu. Journalists contacted by Horizon have not been told that the company was representing the groups as part of the Ricu contract. Breakthrough is understood to say that there was no obligation to disclose the government\u2019s involvement.</p> <p>Breakthrough says in one document that it \u201cunderstands the sensitive nature of Ricu\u2019s work and adheres to the highest standards of security and confidentiality\u201d. Were Ricu\u2019s involvement to be exposed, there would be a negative impact not only on the credibility of the messages, but on \u201cRicu, Prevent and the Home Office\u2019s reputation\u201d.</p> <p>The purpose of this work, Breakthrough makes clear, is to help the British government \u201cpromote a reconciled British Muslim identity\u201d while keeping its involvement hidden, as \u201cany content or messaging attributed to the state are highly unlikely to have any credibility among these audiences\u201d.</p> <p>To achieve the government\u2019s aim, Ricu is attempting to change the way young British Muslims think and act: time and again the documents talk about \u201cimplementing attitudinal and behavioural change communications\u201d; \u201cmeasurable attitudinal change outcomes\u201d; and \u201ccampaigns designed to deliver real attitudinal and behavioural change\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018They\u2019re not what they seem\u2019</h2> <p>Breakthrough has contracts with several non-governmental bodies and has been transparent about governmental support for communications campaigns in east Africa. But several sources say its work for Ricu dwarfs its other operations.</p> <p>Breakthrough\u2019s relationship with the unit is lucrative. In 2012-13, the firm received \u00a3448,286 from its contracts with the OSCT. By 2013-14, this had increased to \u00a35,911,719. In total, the company has earned \u00a311.8m from the OSCT since 2012.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4976cad419ff4fa9e4a6ea921021b6c5d71c90b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4976cad419ff4fa9e4a6ea921021b6c5d71c90b0/0_43_2557_1534/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May, the home secretary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May, the home secretary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One person with knowledge of Ricu\u2019s work said some freelancers working with Breakthrough do not appear to know they are engaged in covert propaganda. Several former Breakthrough employees, both freelance and staff, told the Guardian they had not heard of Ricu \u2013 a suggestion Breakthrough is understood to contest.</p> <p>One former employee said she left after realising she was working on propaganda because she considered the work to be \u201cstupid and reprehensible\u201d.</p> <p>Another, a freelance, said she realised the connection after Breakthrough managers repeatedly requested editing changes. \u201cIt became obvious that it was being directed from outside the company. It was a slightly more shadowy process. I asked where the money was coming from and they said the Home Office. I was uneasy enough to get out. They are not what they seem.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office refused to answer questions about Ricu\u2019s work and would not permit anyone from the unit to be interviewed. It would not comment on the extent of the home secretary\u2019s oversight of Ricu; nor would it respond to suggestions that its covert support for Muslim organisations risks undermining support from Muslim civil society as a whole.</p> <p>It issued a statement, however, saying it was working with communities, civil society groups and individuals to counter the \u201ctwisted narrative\u201d of terrorists and extremists.</p> <p>\u201cWe are proud of the support Ricu has provided to organisations working on the frontline to challenge the warped ideology of groups such as Daesh [Isis], and to protect communities,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>\u201cThis work can involve sensitive issues, vulnerable communities and hard-to-reach audiences, and it has been important to build relationships out of the media glare.

      "bodyText": "The UK government has embarked on a series of clandestine propaganda campaigns intended to bring about \u201cattitudinal and behavioural change\u201d among young British Muslims as part of a counter-radicalisation programme. In a sign of mounting anxiety across Whitehall over the persuasiveness of Islamic State\u2019s online propaganda, a secretive Home Office unit has developed a discreet multimillion pound counter-messaging operation that it says privately is running at \u201cindustrial pace and scale\u201d. However, the methods of the Research, Information and Communications Unit (Ricu), which often conceal the government\u2019s role, will dismay some Muslims and may undermine confidence in the Prevent counter-radicalisation programme, which already faces widespread criticism. One Ricu initiative, which advertises itself as a campaign providing advice on how to raise funds for Syrian refugees, has had face-to-face conversations with thousands of students at university freshers\u2019 fairs without any students realising they were engaging with a government programme. That campaign, called Help for Syria, has distributed leaflets to 760,000 homes without the recipients realising they were government communications. Much of Ricu\u2019s work is outsourced to a London communications company, Breakthrough Media Network, which has produced dozens of websites, leaflets, videos, films, Facebook pages, Twitter feeds and online radio content, with titles such as The Truth about Isis and Help for Syria. Breakthrough also organises events at schools and universities and works closely with a number of grassroots Muslim organisations to disseminate messages and campaigns challenging extremism that the company has developed as part of its Ricu contract. Breakthrough also helped form a PR company that promoted the work of the grassroots organisations to journalists. The community groups said their relationship with Ricu helps them get their own messages to a wider audience, and that they retain editorial control over counter-radicalisation communications. However, a series of Ricu and Breakthrough documents seen by the Guardian show that Ricu privately says it is the one retaining editorial control, including over the products produced as part of these partnerships. In one document, Breakthrough suggests that while the community groups are consulted at several stages of the project, final approval should be Ricu\u2019s. A former Breakthrough employee said communications campaigns were designed according to objectives set by Ricu, and that the government closely oversaw the progress of products and had final signoff. The messages are targeted at \u201cPrevent audiences\u201d, which are defined as British Muslims, particularly males, aged 15 to 39. The Home Office is highly defensive of Ricu\u2019s work. One senior official acknowledged the unit was engaged in propaganda campaigns but said: \u201cAll we\u2019re trying to do is stop people becoming suicide bombers.\u201d Westminster\u2019s intelligence and security committee, which oversees Ricu, says it believes the unit\u2019s work is an important element of the Prevent strategy. Andrew Stunell, a former Liberal Democrat minister who was involved in drawing up counter-extremism policies in the coalition government, said he believed it to be \u201csound and reasonable\u201d to support community groups that were promoting moderation, and that he was neutral on the question of whether government involvement should be acknowledged. Several other former government ministers familiar with Ricu\u2019s work insisted it was an essential component of the government\u2019s efforts to counter Isis propaganda. They declined to be identified, however, with one saying this was because the work was classified. One former minister said it would be \u201cnaive\u201d to suggest the government could openly communicate its counter-radicalisation messages. But another, who is broadly supportive of Ricu, said he believed the deception involved in the dissemination of the messages could damage trust between the government and Muslim citizens. Critics of Ricu\u2019s behavioural change programme say they fear it could cause serious damage to the relationship between the government and Muslims. Imran Khan, the human rights lawyer who represented the family of murdered London teenager Stephen Lawrence, said: \u201cIf the government wants its Muslim citizens to listen to it, it needs to be trusted. And to be trusted, it needs to be honest. What is happening here is not honest, it\u2019s deeply deceptive. \u201cFurthermore, this government needs to stop thinking of young British Muslims as some sort of fifth column that it needs to deal with.\u201d Frances Webber, vice-chair of the Institute of Race Relations, said the programme risked undermining, rather than amplifying, the work of Muslim civil society if it appeared that groups had been co-opted to a government agenda. She said: \u201cThe community groups are in a double bind; if they don\u2019t disclose government support and it\u2019s revealed, they lose trust. If they do disclose it, they lose trust. \u201cThe government should be asking itself, why is that? The answer is that the whole Prevent model is irretrievably tainted. The government\u2019s counter-radicalisation policy is trying to channel thought, speech and ideas into a fairly narrow concept of what\u2019s acceptable, and everything else is becoming potentially \u2018pre-criminal\u2019.\u201d Some senior government officials who have been closely involved with Prevent also have severe misgivings about how Ricu\u2019s programme is being delivered and believe some Prevent initiatives have been poorly conceived and not properly evaluated. \u201cPrevent isn\u2019t working,\u201d said one. \u201cWe know that because Prevent isn\u2019t preventing.\u201d The aim of the propaganda campaign is set out in a series of documents. Help for Syria, for example, which describes itself as \u201cproviding advice and guidance for anyone who wants to raise money and aid for Syria\u201d, was \u201cdesigned, delivered and \u2026 maintain[ed]\u201d on behalf of Ricu and the Foreign Office to \u201cinfluence conversations among young British Muslims\u201d and reduce the desire to travel to the region. Ricu staff, who include social psychologists and anthropologists as well as counter-terrorism officials and marketing strategists, describe their work as strategic communications rather than propaganda. Breakthrough also privately says that one objective of its Ricu work is to promote \u201ca reconciled British Muslim identity\u201d. The company goes to considerable lengths to conceal Ricu\u2019s involvement in its work. A number of staff are security-cleared and new recruits are expected to sign non-disclosure agreements. The company has also offered to wipe computer hard drives after work has been delivered to the Home Office and to use mobile phones that can be disabled if lost or stolen. Breakthrough is understood to say that its relationship with Ricu is not covert, and that it is up to the community groups to decide whether they disclose the government\u2019s support. However, in documents seen by the Guardian, Breakthrough says it accepts that \u201cany content or messaging attributed to the state are highly unlikely to have any credibility among these audiences\u201d and that disclosure of the government\u2019s role would have a \u201cnegative impact on \u2026 the product, Ricu, Prevent and the Home Office\u2019s reputation\u201d. Several sources say some of the campaign material has been tested on focus groups of young British Muslims without acknowledging its connection to Prevent. One of Ricu\u2019s primary tasks is to monitor online conversations among what it describes as vulnerable communities. After products are released, Ricu staff monitor \u201ckey forums\u201d for online conversations to \u201ctrack shifting narratives\u201d, one of the documents shows. Strategic communications is defined by the UK government as \u201cthe systematic and coordinated use of all means of communication to deliver UK national security objectives by influencing the attitudes and behaviours of individuals, groups and states\u201d. With the public unaware of how strategic communications operations are being conducted, the government has made a number of public announcements about its investment in such campaigns. Last September, David Cameron announced at a UN leaders\u2019 conference in New York that his government would spend \u00a310m on a UK-based \u201cstrategic communications cell\u201d in order to wage what he candidly described as a \u201cpropaganda war\u201d against Isis. The Home Office issued a statement saying it was working with communities, civil society groups and individuals to counter the \u201ctwisted narrative\u201d of terrorists and extremists. \u201cWe are proud of the support Ricu has provided to organisations working on the frontline to challenge the warped ideology of groups such as Daesh [Isis], and to protect communities,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis work can involve sensitive issues, vulnerable communities and hard-to-reach audiences, and it has been important to build relationships out of the media glare. We respect the bravery of individuals and organisations who choose to speak out against violence and extremism and it is right that we support and protect them. \u201cOur guiding principle has to be whether or not any organisation we work with is itself happy to talk publicly about what they do. At the same time we are as open as we can be and have referenced the role of Ricu in publications and in parliament.\u201d The Guardian understands that the Home Office and the Foreign Office are about to embark on an expanded programme of strategic communications initiatives.

They declined to be identified, however, with one saying this was because the work was classified.</p> <p>One former minister said it would be \u201cnaive\u201d to suggest the government could openly communicate its counter-radicalisation messages. But another, who is broadly supportive of Ricu, said he believed the deception involved in the dissemination of the messages could damage trust between the government and Muslim citizens.</p> <p>Critics of Ricu\u2019s behavioural change programme say they fear it could cause serious damage to the relationship between the government and Muslims.</p> <p>Imran Khan, the human rights lawyer who represented the family of murdered London teenager Stephen Lawrence, said: \u201cIf the government wants its Muslim citizens to listen to it, it needs to be trusted. And to be trusted, it needs to be honest.

The answer is that the whole <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/03/prevent-strategy-sowing-mistrust-fear-muslim-communities\">Prevent</a> model is irretrievably tainted. The government\u2019s counter-radicalisation policy is trying to channel thought, speech and ideas into a fairly narrow concept of what\u2019s acceptable, and everything else is becoming potentially \u2018pre-criminal\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Some senior government officials who have been closely involved with Prevent also have severe misgivings about how Ricu\u2019s programme is being delivered and believe <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/09/prevent-strategy-stifles-debate-and-makes-teachers-feel-vulnerable\">some Prevent initiatives have been poorly conceived </a>and not properly evaluated. \u201cPrevent isn\u2019t working,\u201d said one. \u201cWe know that because Prevent isn\u2019t preventing.\u201d</p> <p>The aim of the propaganda campaign is set out in a series of documents. Help for Syria, for example, which describes itself as \u201cproviding advice and guidance for anyone who wants to raise money and aid for Syria\u201d, was \u201cdesigned, delivered and \u2026 maintain[ed]\u201d on behalf of Ricu and the Foreign Office to \u201cinfluence conversations among young British Muslims\u201d and reduce the desire to travel to the region.</p> <p>Ricu staff, who include social psychologists and anthropologists as well as counter-terrorism officials and marketing strategists, describe their work as strategic communications rather than propaganda. </p> <p>Breakthrough also privately says that one objective of its Ricu work is to promote \u201ca reconciled British Muslim identity\u201d.</p> <p>The company goes to considerable lengths to conceal Ricu\u2019s involvement in its work. A number of staff are security-cleared and new recruits are expected to sign non-disclosure agreements.

      "bodyText": "To describe the American Country Countdown awards is a bit like explaining your sister\u2019s fourth husband \u2013 no one accepts him as part of the family yet but he\u2019s trying very hard. The awards show, which Fox broadcast on Sunday, is a creation of Dick Clark\u2019s production company and terrestrial radio giant Cumulus media and based on American Country Countdown with Kix Brooks, a weekly show tabulating current airplay hits. Ford is a sponsor. That\u2019s a lot of synergy, but there was a sense during the two-hour broadcast that synergy is all the show was about. Certainly it wasn\u2019t status: this was only the second year of the award show\u2019s existence, so for a musical genre already honored by multiple yearly awards shows backed by industry organizations going back decades, the value of yet another trophy was circumspect. That was clearly evident when Chris Stapleton won album of the year and didn\u2019t show up. Instead, he delivered a pre-recorded thank you from his tour bus. Ouch. But maybe it was for the best. If he had made it to the Forum in Inglewood, California, to pick up the award, he would have discovered that it was Paula Abdul, that legendary country music icon, who was doing the presenting. Here is a rundown of memorable and forgettable moments of the Sunday telecast: Forgettable: Chris Stapleton wins just once At the recent Academy of Country Music awards, Stapleton \u2013 who is considered the most exciting new voice in the genre \u2013 walked home with six trophies. At last year\u2019s Country Music Association awards, his debut with Justin Timberlake became a viral hit for weeks. On Sunday, Stapleton won just album of the year, primarily because he was nominated only once. That\u2019s because the ACC awards are based on \u201cradio airplay charts, sales and streaming data\u201d and not voting. Stapleton\u2019s breakout album Traveller may have blazed to the top of most critic lists, but commercial radio was not friendly to it in the beginning. Memorable: a Merle Haggard tribute featuring the Strangers Actor Matthew McConaughey introduced the Strangers, the long-time band of the late Merle Haggard who died early last month. The band presented a six-song melody of Haggard\u2019s most memorable hits \u2013 Mama Tried, Today I Started Loving You Again and Silver Wings among them \u2013 with his wife Theresa in attendance and Toby Keith handling lead vocals. Producers placed the tribute at the end of the night, which was wise. Earlier performances by newcomers such as Sam Hunt and Thomas Rhett had more to do with Coldplay than the music Haggard had a hand in shaping. Forgettable: Brooks and Dunn The country duo was awarded something called the Nash Icon Award, presented by Reba McEntire. They performed the 2013 hit Red Dirt Road, but since the entire event was based on Brooks\u2019s radio show, this was a dubious honor at best. Memorable: remembering women Country music radio has a woman problem in that female artists are in a stark minority on national playlists. That\u2019s why it was significant when the show opened with Sugarland\u2019s Jennifer Nettles, newcomer Cam and veteran Martina McBride singing This One\u2019s For the Girls \u2013 McBride\u2019s anthem. Message sent. Forgettable: Kelsea Ballerini I\u2019m not sure if this show needed a performance with emoticons, but nevertheless this teen-pop newcomer provided one. Her performance of Dibs started after she snapped a selfie and continued as both text bubbles from fans popped on the screen and emoticons flashed to reflect the lyrics. That was a lot of production to prop up a singer whose music is the equivalent of Styrofoam. Memorable: Dwight Yoakam gives a covert history lesson Dwight Yoakam looked particularly uncomfortable presenting the artist of the year award. He gave a quick history lesson, connecting the west coast location of the awards to the Bakersfield sound of the 1950s. But before he called Luke Bryan to the stage to accept, he slipped in a covert reference to Hank Williams \u2013 \u201cNot Luke the Drifter, Luke Bryan!\u201d Luke the Drifter was Williams\u2019s alter ego and the subject of a collection of dark-themed songs from 1953. Forgettable: Florida Georgia Line This soft rock duo performed Holy, a power ballad with sickly lyrics such as \u201cI don\u2019t need these stars because you shine for me/Like fire in my veins you\u2019re my ecstasy\u201d that sounded like they were lifted from the mad ramblings of a serial stalker. Memorable: the format Unlike most award shows, the ACC awards stayed within two hours because of economy: no host, and artists knew beforehand they won, eliminating the suspense. In fact, the show had little drama going for it, and that appeared to be the point.",

Earlier performances by newcomers such as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/03/meet-sam-hunt-future-superstar-pop-wolf-in-country-clothing\"> Sam Hunt</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/15/thomas-rhett-crash-burn-uptown-funk-country-music\">Thomas Rhett</a> had more to do with Coldplay than the music Haggard had a hand in shaping. </p> <h2><strong>Forgettable: Brooks and Dunn</strong></h2> <p>The country duo was awarded something called the Nash Icon Award, presented by Reba McEntire. They performed the 2013 hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBTpoKvre84\">Red Dirt Road</a>, but since the entire event was based on Brooks\u2019s radio show, this was a dubious honor at best.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f9f9595d65fd6dd30ee53ce0821287ad848234a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f9f9595d65fd6dd30ee53ce0821287ad848234a/0_179_4860_2914/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reba McEntire poses with singers Ronnie Dunn (left) and Kix Brooks of Brooks &amp; Dunn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reba McEntire poses with singers Ronnie Dunn (left) and Kix Brooks of Brooks &amp; Dunn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gregg DeGuire/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Memorable: remembering women</strong></h2> <p>Country music radio has a woman problem in that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/27/saladgate-tomatoes-women-country-music\">female artists are in a stark minority on national playlists</a>. That\u2019s why it was significant when the show opened with Sugarland\u2019s Jennifer Nettles, newcomer Cam and veteran Martina McBride singing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTowId2CWHA\">This One\u2019s For the Girls</a> \u2013 McBride\u2019s anthem.

Her performance of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3lCzEOy5xs\">Dibs</a> started after she snapped a selfie and continued as both text bubbles from fans popped on the screen and emoticons flashed to reflect the lyrics. That was a lot of production to prop up a singer whose music is the equivalent of Styrofoam. </p> <h2><strong>Memorable: Dwight Yoakam gives a covert history lesson</strong></h2> <p>Dwight Yoakam looked particularly uncomfortable presenting the artist of the year award. He gave a quick history lesson, connecting the west coast location of the awards to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/bakersfield-sound-ma0000002443\">Bakersfield sound</a> of the 1950s. But before he called Luke Bryan to the stage to accept, he slipped in a covert reference to Hank Williams \u2013 \u201cNot Luke the Drifter, Luke Bryan!\u201d Luke the Drifter was Williams\u2019s alter ego and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.poetspath.com/exhibits/troubadours_hank.html\">the subject of a collection of dark-themed songs</a> from 1953.</p> <h2><strong>Forgettable: Florida Georgia Line</strong></h2> <p>This soft rock duo performed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXDAYlhdkyg\">Holy</a>, a power ballad with sickly lyrics such as \u201cI don\u2019t need these stars because you shine for me/Like fire in my veins you\u2019re my ecstasy\u201d that sounded like they were lifted from the mad ramblings of a serial stalker. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"564a4e529e298c053681812fc46854608f5dbc98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/564a4e529e298c053681812fc46854608f5dbc98/0_196_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Florida Georgia Line reach for the lazers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Florida Georgia Line reach for the lazers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jerod Harris/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Memorable: the format</strong></h2> <p>Unlike most award shows, the ACC awards stayed within two hours because of economy: no host, and artists knew beforehand they won, eliminating the suspense.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The violinist Alan Loveday, who has died aged 88, went on from prodigious beginnings in New Zealand to London, and in particular the Academy of St Martin in the Fields (ASMF). As one of the ensemble\u2019s soloists and leaders, he helped create its distinctively brilliant and even string sound. The ASMF\u2019s founder, Neville Marriner, asked Loveday to be the violin soloist in a recording of Vivaldi\u2019s The Four Seasons (1969); his beautiful, unmannered playing led to sales of half a million copies and the ASMF\u2019s first gold disc. Marriner, a contemporary at the Royal College of Music in London, recalled that Loveday \u201cwas better than any of us. I would say that he was the best individual violin player that the RCM has ever produced.\u201d Other recordings with the ASMF included more Vivaldi and the Mozart concertos, of which No 3 in G major was particularly admired. With the Royal Danish Orchestra he recorded the Beethoven concerto (1959). Much of Loveday\u2019s career was spent as a session player for recordings \u2013 always the best players and the best pay. He and colleagues from the group provided the backing on various Beatles songs, including Hey Jude, on which they may be heard singing, too. Loveday was also leader of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in the late 1960s, and took the solos in Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s Scheherazade under Rudolf Kempe. Their recording was well received, but Loveday recalled in an interview that Kempe had not liked his playing much and would not look at him for his entries, which caused some mayhem. Though he appeared at the Proms 26 times from 1946 to 1972 in concertos by Bach, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky, Elgar, Sibelius and Walton, to the regret of many the full international career expected of Loveday did not materialise. This was possibly because playing the violin was not something he chose to do, and nor did he have a burning ambition to succeed. Born in Palmerston North, to the north of the New Zealand capital of Wellington, Alan was the son of Margaret (nee Rickard) and Leslie Loveday. His father played in dance bands, taught a range of instruments \u2013 sitar, banjo, mandolin, guitar \u2013 and was an amateur violinist. He and Margaret, a schoolteacher, decided to educate their only son at home. Leslie was determined that Alan would play the violin, and from two years old the child practised for 10 minutes a day, leading to his first recital at four, including an astonishing Flight of the Bumblebee. The violin did not appear to interest the child particularly, and was just part of growing up (lessons from his father were replaced by those of Ava Symons). The only real glimpse into another world came when Yehudi Menuhin visited Wellington when Alan was about 10. He played to Menuhin, and also to the Budapest String Quartet. At their encouragement it was decided to have a local benefit concert to raise funds to send the 11-year-old Alan with his mother Margaret to the UK for violin lessons. Arriving there shortly before the outbreak of the second world war, he became a pupil of the leading player Albert Sammons, who was like a father to Loveday and taught him gratis until he went to the Royal College of Music in his mid-teens. The violinist Hugh Bean also learned with Sammons, and the two boys would go to cartoon films together and became friends, both before and at the RCM. Loveday, Marriner and the pianist and broadcaster Antony Hopkins played as a trio. Marriner said: \u201cAs a second violin I was quite a good partner but there was no comparison between us. We would tour and had great fun, playing golf in the afternoons, then the concert, and afterwards play poker until the small hours.\u201d From 1949 he also had a conventional piano trio with the cellist Amaryllis Fleming and pianist Peggy Gray. Through playing table tennis, at which Loveday excelled with an unreturnable backhand, he met the pianist Ruth Stanfield, whom he married in 1952. They toured New Zealand in 1953, and then again in 1971. With another duo partner, the pianist Leonard Cassini, he recorded works by Beethoven, Brahms, Elgar, Martin\u016f and John Ireland. Loveday recalled a great deal of vodka on a Russian tour in 1954, which he said Cassini engineered through his communist connections. The following year he became a professor at the RCM. He reckoned that his pupils, who over the next 17 years included Frances Mason and Peter Carter, formerly leader of the Allegri String Quartet, would always improve if they listened to themselves through headphones. Eventually alcohol came to affect his behaviour and reliability as a player, but he battled the addiction successfully and was able to rejoin the ASMF, where he was happy to play in the back desks until his retirement. His colleagues enjoyed his sense of humour and remember him as a free spirit. He was also a first-class bridge and chess player, and played these with Ruth, even after their divorce, and with his daughter, Rosalind (Buz), an amateur musician herself (she learned on Alan\u2019s eighth-size violin) and a dementia specialist trainer. Both survive him. Loveday\u2019s son, Ian, a DJ and techno musician, died in 2009. \u2022 Alan Raymond Loveday, violinist, born 29 February 1928; died 12 April 2016 \u2022 This article was amended on 22 June 2016 to correct the name of the pianist Peggy Gray.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a place on the internet where thousands of Americans across the political spectrum are hanging out together and not arguing \u2013 they\u2019re actually having a great time. The man responsible for this miracle is Bernie Sanders, but not in the way you might think. The only requirement for joining the subreddit Enough Sanders Spam is a hatred of overzealous Sanders fans and a willingness to put aside personal politics for the fun of roasting them. The low barrier to entry has, counterintuitively perhaps, made it one of the most collegial gathering spots in an increasingly divisive campaign. Reddit, whose readership overwhelmingly consists of young males with a preference for digital news sources, is crawling with Sanders fanatics, and that\u2019s left many of the site\u2019s users fed up with the Sanders bias on the message board-style site, which consistently sees massive traffic figures. So user globalglastnost created a forum to lampoon it. It has more than 6,000 subscribers. \u201cI am in New England and have seen face-to-face what I call the \u2018green tea bagger\u2019 types,\u201d globalglastnost told me in a private message on Reddit, describing green tea baggers to another redditor as \u201cvery uncompromising, unapologetic and dogmatic\u201d. One of Enough Sanders Spam\u2019s main targets is the subreddit /r/Politics, which is one of the site\u2019s most popular, with more than 3 million subscribers. In the course of the campaign, it has become a second Bernie Sanders for President page. All stories about the candidate are positive, all stories about Hillary Clinton are negative, and all stories about anything else are few and far between. Commenters who criticize Sanders on /r/Politics are called \u201clow-information voters\u201d or \u201cShillaries\u201d. And when faced with a Democratic primary loss, Sanders supporters cry voter fraud. Here\u2019s a characteristic comment posted on /r/Politics the night that Hillary Clinton won the Nevada Democratic caucus: To all the Hillary gloaters, i\u2019ll tell you one thing. r/politics is, and always will be, Bernie territory. OUR territory. The mods of r/politics have formally endorsed Senator Sanders for president. We will continue to control the front page with positive Bernie news. So before you start talking shit and bragging about your bitch\u2019s win, I\u2019ll have you know that we\u2019re well versed in downvote brigades. Say RIP to your karma if you try anything cute. Assholes. The site runs on user-submitted stories that everyone votes on to decide what gets shown on the front page, which is in turn fodder for much of what eventually filters on to mainstream news sites. Manipulating votes is against Reddit\u2019s rules, but when it comes to the 2016 presidential race, all of that has gone out the window. So it\u2019s led to a strange space where bipartisanism works in service of trying to push back against a giant Bernie bias. \u201cThe community has grown steadily, but the past few months has seen surges,\u201d globalglastnost said. Subscribers are from across the political spectrum, including former supporters of Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Donald Trump and, of course, Hillary Clinton. Some subscribers aren\u2019t even American. Political debates are not allowed on the site; everyone is there strictly to laugh at Sanders and his sycophants. In addition to keeping tabs on each day\u2019s most ridiculous Sanders spam across the internet, the sub has archived some of the most legendary posts from his fans on Reddit (\u201cMessage to Democratic Party: embrace the Bernie Movement or face total extinction\u201d). There\u2019s also a mega-thread from the night of the New York primary, which was the Christmas Eve of /r/enoughsandersspam: a night everyone looked forward to as the unofficial end to the Sanders campaign. There\u2019s a comprehensive list with citations of the craziest things that Bernie Sanders has said (\u201cI don\u2019t believe in charities\u201d). But my favorite thing on Enough Sanders Spam has been the Upvotes Party they had after Hillary Clinton won the New York primary. It really illustrated the cross-political nature of the sub. \u201cAs a Hillary supporter, I know this place can get very Hill-centric, so I wanted to throw out a CONGRATULATIONS Trump supporters on your victory tonight as well!!!\u201d is just one characteristic example. As the Sanders campaign winds down (Bernie laid off hundreds of campaign staff last week after losing four out of five east coast primaries on Tuesday), even some Sanders supporters have found their way to /r/enoughsandersspam, and, true to form, they\u2019ve been welcomed with open arms. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer shit about your views,\u201d redditor yzlautum wrote. \u201cThis sub is to just laugh at all the ridiculousness that occurs with Bernie, his campaign and his supporters.\u201d When I asked what will happen to /r/enoughsandersspam after Hillary Clinton becomes the presumptive Democratic nominee, globalglastnost pointed out that the sub has already been jokingly rebranded as /r/enough_jill_stein_spam on the subreddit\u2019s main banner, a reference to Green Party candidate Jill Stein, whose candidacy would offer a natural progression for Sanders fans who swear they\u2019d never vote for Clinton. I\u2019m sure Enough Sanders Spam subscribers would be on board, considering they regularly post messages to each other on the sub like this one: \u201cI\u2019M GONNA MISS ALL OF YOU SINCE BERNIE JUST LOST &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3. I LOVE YOU ALL &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3.\u201d In what is, perhaps, America\u2019s most polarized and unsettling presidential race to date, a love-fest between conservatives and liberals turns out the be the sanest choice of all.",

      "bodyText": "Three distant worlds that orbit a feeble star in the constellation of Aquarius are the most likely places discovered so far to find life beyond the solar system, astronomers say. The Earth-sized planets are all thought to have regions where surface temperatures fall within the Goldilocks zone and are neither too hot nor too cold for water to run freely, making them at least potentially hospitable to life. Belgian astronomers found the planets using the Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope (Trappist) at the La Silla Observatory in Chile\u2019s Atacama desert. The planets revealed themselves through the periodic dimming that occurred as they passed in front of their parent star, an ultracool dwarf that lies only 40 light years away. Known formally as 2MASS J23062928-0502285, but helpfully dubbed Trappist-1, the star is not much larger than Jupiter and emits a fraction of the sun\u2019s radiation. The star is too faint to see in the night sky with the naked eye, or even through a large amateur telescope. Observations from the Trappist telescope taken from September to December last year, and follow-up measurements from larger instruments, revealed three small planets orbiting very close to the star, at 1%, 1.5% and about 3% of the distance that Earth lies from the sun. A year on the innermost planet passes in only 1.5 Earth days, and in 2.4 Earth days on the second. The orbit of the third planet is less certain, with a year passing in 4.5 to 73 Earth days, according to a report in the journal Nature. \u201cBecause the star is so faint, all of these planets have temperatures that are similar to those on Earth. They could have liquid water on the surfaces, and on Earth life is critically dependent on water. We don\u2019t know, but maybe there could be life there,\u201d said Micha\u00ebl Gillon who led the research at the University of Liege. The planets are thought to be tidally-locked to their star, meaning one half is in permanent daytime, and the other in constant darkness. If the planets have atmospheres, the alien air would even out the temperature difference across the hemispheres. At the hottest spots, the temperature would reach about 100 Celsius on the innermost planet, 70 Celsius on the second, and perhaps 30Celsius on the outermost world. \u201cThese are the first temperate Earth-sized planets found outside the solar system, and the first we can study in detail,\u201d said Gillon. \u201cThat makes them extremely promising targets for us.\u201d The composition of the planets is not yet known, but the sizes mean they must be solid. \u201cThey could be iron-rich like Mercury, or mostly silicate rocks, or extremely icy, like the moons of Jupiter,\u201d said Gillon. Plans have already been drawn up to study the planets in greater detail. With the Hubble space telescope, the astronomers hope to learn whether the worlds have their own atmospheres. But future instruments will be needed to find out much more about the planets. If they do have atmospheres, then analysing the molecular constituents for water, carbon dioxide and ozone could reveal evidence for life. Those measurements will be possible from two forthcoming observatories, the European Extremely Large Telescope, which is under construction in the Atacama desert, and the James Webb Space Telescope, Nasa\u2019s new infrared observatory, which is due to launch in 2018. Once they are in operation, astronomers can begin the search for biological activity on the planets. \u201cThat\u2019s a giant step in the search for life in the universe,\u201d said Julien de Wit, a co-author on the study at MIT.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "What proportion of British board members are women? The figures are disappointing (26.1% at FTSE 100 companies and 19.6% at FTSE 250 firms), which is why a target has been set for FTSE 100 firms to have 33% female board members by 2020. But what\u2019s it like for those who have made it in already? We hear confessions from women both in the public and private sector. \u2018People commented on my looks, not my capabilities\u2019 I was the only woman of 13 men on the board of a large IT services company, and was on the receiving end of a lot of sexist bias \u2013 some conscious but a lot of it unconscious. For example, I experienced inappropriate comments and unsolicited advances from my mainly married peers at board level. Women at all levels experience this, however. I was quite young when I joined this board \u2013 33 \u2013 and many also felt that it was OK to comment on my looks rather than my capabilities. This led me to changing my image to discourage any attention: I wore no makeup and screwed my hair back. I got the position through hard work and building up a good reputation (I had been referred to the chief executive by a senior woman in my previous company) so my looks should never have come into it. I am not sure men are aware that mentioning how women look makes many of us feel uncomfortable. I really think that they must believe we feel complimented in some way. But instead it makes a lot of women believe that they don\u2019t want to be in that boys\u2019 club and so they are turned off from applying for those positions; they may think that they simply don\u2019t belong in that environment, or are intimidated by it. Despite this, it has been my privilege to be the only woman, the group marketing director, on the board of a $1bn company, told by several female employees that they saw me as a role model. That was what really made it for me; that I might have inspired at least one other woman to try. One of the big issues, certainly in the technology sector, is the unconscious bias of a profile of white male executives in their 50s doing the hiring to boards. For example just today, one of the women that I coach in a large tech company said: \u201cAll the managers here are white, middle-aged men. When a woman leaves, she is replaced by a man.\u201d Whether this is true or not, that is her perception. This is a young, university-educated 20-something who is looking desperately for role models. So the key challenge is: who is there for her to look up to, and whose footsteps does she follow in? Former female board member of large UK firm, 39 \u2018The UK is much better than elsewhere in the world\u2019 On the face of it, you would expect the board I sit on (of a public/private initiative in the north), to be horribly sexist. Its shareholders include a council, a university and a telecommunications services company. However, I have never felt that any dialogue, debate or attitude has been influenced by my gender. In fact, I have experienced less sexism while sitting on boards than I have when pitching for or delivering work. I have also sat on boards abroad, and have seen horrendous sexism and racism elsewhere in the world. I\u2019m actually very proud of the UK and our inclusive society. While the situation is improving, however, I believe quotas would be a mistake. Women want to feel that they have got something because of their own merit, and being seen as a \u201cquota hire\u201d will undoubtedly, at some point, incentivise a discriminatory comment, such as: \u201cYou\u2019re only here because we had to have a woman.\u201d In order to be taken seriously we, as women, cannot be seen as the victim or a group that needs special attention \u2013 we have to prove our worth and stand on our own two feet. Any purposeful and harmful discrimination needs to be dealt with professionally, within the boundaries of the law and governance. A consultant specialising in technology startups, 47 \u2018Women need to have more role models\u2019 My board roles are in the public/third sector and on both boards there is a high percentage of women. As a result, perhaps, I have not been aware of any overt discrimination or sexism. I suspect that private sector experiences would be very different. However, I am sure that there is a level of unconscious sexism, and I have no way of knowing if I failed to get other roles because of my gender. Interestingly, I experienced active discrimination at a previous role where women\u2019s efforts to progress to board level were actively blocked, and men\u2019s encouraged. There are definitely more challenges for women trying to get on a board, including a lack of effective role models throughout the career process. I meet many women who have never thought that a board position could be a possibility, so have not thought about how to structure their career to attain it. (Women also seem to be worse at career planning than men.) We also face bias \u2013 conscious or unconscious \u2013 in staff development and recruitment. There\u2019s a well-known factor that groups will recruit new group members that they feel comfortable with. This generally means \u201cpeople like them\u201d. So a predominantly white male board will usually prefer white male candidates. Plus, recruitment methods are often unconsciously biased by the experience of the recruiter. When I started my career, women were steered towards softer subjects and softer careers, which typically are not represented at board level. Now my cohort and I are reaching the level of seniority to consider board positions, those career choices may hinder advancement to the next level because there isn\u2019t the perceived need for those softer skills at board level. So the pool of suitable candidates has far more men than women. Technology director at a public sector organisation, 51 \u2018There\u2019s a real old boys\u2019 network in the private sector\u2019 The disparity between how women are treated in the public and private sector is massive. I have worked in a FTSE 100 company and also for a public sector organisation in an education role. The private sector follows a law unto itself and women are seen much less on board and senior executive roles. However, moving into the public sector it\u2019s been much more diverse. That\u2019s particularly relevant to the sector I work in. In the business sector for women who don\u2019t have kids maybe there is less of a difference but the moment you have a child everything changes. At the FTSE company meetings were always held in the evenings, making it hard if you had a caring responsibility. I now work in a senior role in the education sector and it\u2019s my responsibility to recruit board members. As a mother with three children I am careful to make sure that my meetings are flexible, looking at the best time to try to be family-friendly. I have also seen an old boys\u2019 network culture in the private sector where men on boards go to things such as the rugby, or out drinking, excluding women \u2013 even if you\u2019re working at the same level. I cannot say I\u2019ve experienced any overt discrimination myself, but I think there is a real reluctance for the private sector to embrace gender diversity in the same way as the public sector. We\u2019ve seen improvements on boards in the public sector \u2013 for example, in education, the NHS and police \u2013 but the private business world is very slow on the uptake.

Interestingly, I experienced active discrimination at a previous role where women\u2019s efforts to progress to board level were actively blocked, and men\u2019s encouraged.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2016/apr/20/five-things-to-promote-gender-equality-at-work\">Five things to promote gender equality at work</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are definitely more challenges for women trying to get on a board, including a lack of effective role models throughout the career process. I meet many women who have never thought that a board position could be a possibility, so have not thought about how to structure their career to attain it. (Women also seem to be worse at career planning than men.) We also face bias \u2013 conscious or unconscious \u2013 in staff development and recruitment. There\u2019s a well-known factor that groups will recruit new group members that they feel comfortable with. This generally means \u201cpeople like them\u201d. So a predominantly white male board will usually prefer white male candidates. Plus, recruitment methods are often unconsciously biased by the experience of the recruiter.</p> <p>When I started my career, women were steered towards softer subjects and softer careers, which typically are not represented at board level. Now my cohort and I are reaching the level of seniority to consider board positions, those career choices may hinder advancement to the next level because there isn\u2019t the perceived need for those softer skills at board level. So the pool of suitable candidates has far more men than women. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /><em>Technology director at a public sector organisation,</em><em tabindex=\"-1\"> 51</em></p> <h2>\u2018There\u2019s a real old boys\u2019 network in the private sector\u2019</h2> <p>The disparity between how women are treated in the public and private sector is massive. I have worked in a FTSE 100 company and also for a public sector organisation in an education role. The private sector follows a law unto itself and women are seen much less on board and senior executive roles. However, moving into the public sector it\u2019s been much more diverse. That\u2019s particularly relevant to the sector I work in.</p> <p>In the business sector for women who don\u2019t have kids maybe there is less of a difference but the moment you have a child everything changes. At the FTSE company meetings were always held in the evenings, making it hard if you had a caring responsibility.<br /></p> <p>I now work in a senior role in the education sector and it\u2019s my responsibility to recruit board members. As a mother with three children I am careful to make sure that my meetings are flexible, looking at the best time to try to be family-friendly.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>I have also seen an old boys\u2019 network culture in the private sector where men on boards go to things such as the rugby, or out drinking, excluding women \u2013 even if you\u2019re working at the same level.<br /></p> <p>I cannot say I\u2019ve experienced any overt discrimination myself, but I think there is a real reluctance for the private sector to embrace gender diversity in the same way as the public sector. We\u2019ve seen improvements on boards in the public sector \u2013 for example, in education, the NHS and police \u2013 but the private business world is very slow on the uptake. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /><em tabindex=\"-1\">Governance role, 45</em><br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>",

      "bodyText": "The pavilion at Exeter CC has been opened not by cutting a ribbon but by ringing a bell as lustily as I could manage. Chris Rogers, now captaining Somerset, played for Exeter in 2003 and, as it happens, he could have popped down the road, rung the bell and not missed out on batting for his new county. A game of cricket started thereafter and among those bowling for Exeter was Alfonso Thomas, who is their professional/coach this year and Ben Green, the England Under-19 all-rounder, who will have a very handy mentor alongside him. There was, I have gathered, two hours of relatively humdrum play in the morning. Alex Davies went early, Steven Croft late in the session only six runs short of his hundred. So Lancashire do not have any centurions but they do have 372-6. It has been raining, so the players never appeared after lunch; it\u2019s now stopped; the teams, we have been informed, are taking an early tea after which the umpires will make an inspection. So there should be some more cricket, which I promise to watch intently. First impressions count for a lot in this game. A trained eye can spot in a single movement of a batsman whether he has the right rhythm or whether a bowler just looks right. This was the first time I have been able to see Jake Ball and unequivocally he can bowl. His performance in the first hour at Trent Bridge this morning, in which he took the wickets of Adam Lyth, Gary Ballance and Joe Root, the first and last of them for golden ducks, could well be enough to see him in the England squad for the first Test. In the squad, that is, not to play, for that will be down to Broad, Anderson and Finn \u2013 but it is quite a step up. Lyth went to the first ball of the day, well pitched up and moving across him, so that it might have been missing off stump. But Ballance and Root, caught at the wicket and superbly taken at first slip respectively both got excellent deliveries. At 24 for 3 Yorkshire were in a mess and it has been down to Alex Lees and Jonny Bairstow since to repair the damage. Lees is still there at lunch with 69, a determined innings, and Bairstow made 29 before he was beaten by Gurney\u2019s inswing from round the wicket, and was lbw. At 122 for four there is still a lot of work for Yorkshire in pursuit of Nottinghamshire\u2019s 261. The floodlights have been on for a while though and the dark clouds are gathering to the west. The covers are on and it looks as if there will be a drop in the not too distant future. Here are six observations from the week\u2019s county cricket action from Gary Naylor. It is quite bright in Nottingham this morning, with a bit of watery sun, an improvement on first thing when the cloud hung heavy. I was out very early for a run which included an entertaining game of Dodge-The-Drunk on the way up the Mansfield Road. I had the smug satisfaction of knowing that they will feel like shit later and I won\u2019t. There is a bit of rain forecast to arrive after lunch, but it could be an entertaining morning as Yorkshire begin their innings. These are the sort of conditions in which Stuart Broad revels and he could be a handful, particularly on a pitch that will suit his best wicket-taking length. So it could be a challenge for those Yorkshire batsmen who are looking to impress, Adam Lyth, who nonetheless will almost certainly not be opening with Alastair Cook in the first Test, and Gary Ballance, the spell-check nightmare, who almost certainly will be James Taylor\u2019s replacement at number five. Earlier this morning, post-run, I was in Cafe Nero having a pot of porridge and a coffee, and wanting to read online ( buy the paper? Two quid? How much?!!!!) what Vic had to say about the Lancashire-Somerset game. Regrettably, the Wi-Fi connection blocked him, saying among other things it was likely \u201c to cause offence in a public place\u201d. It is not like Vic to be overly raunchy. But it has been known for pieces including \u2018sex\u2019 to be blocked on occasions, which is unfair on Middlesex ( yes it really has happened), but reading Vic at the ground it all seems pretty harmless in that regard. In fairness to Cafe Nero, it transpired the connection was from the Waitrose next door, so maybe there was some implicit criticism of the ending of their sponsorship of the England team. They then blocked the Guardian website in its entirety, so all a bit prissy really. Meanwhile, Vic is opening a new pavilion at Exeter CC today, which I think means cutting a ribbon rather than establishing a new outlet for the Vic Marks Pavilion franchise, so won\u2019t be on duty at Taunton until a bit later.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s stop pretending that Trump is anything other than a shape shifter with no core belief system - besides maybe craven opportunism mixed in with a little bit of racism. Trump has switched positions or lied about his true feelings on virtually every single issue that has come up during this primary campaign. Yet for some reason, he keeps getting credited with having principled beliefs. The latest example was in Sunday\u2019s New York Times, where columnist Maureen Dowd referred to Donald Trump as a foreign policy \u201cdove\u201d \u2013 or at least less hawkish than Hillary Clinton \u2013 because he\u2019s made a few comments, most recently last week, about not starting additional wars in the Middle East. Dowd eventually undermines her own argument, since he is nowhere close to anything of the sort. Three quarters of the way down her column lauding \u201cDonald The Dove\u201d, almost as an afterthought, she adds: \u201cHe can sound belligerent, of course, saying that he would bomb the expletive-deleted out of Isis and that he would think up new and imaginative ways to torture terrorists and kill their families.\u201d That has to be one of the most ridiculous \u201cto be sure\u201d paragraphs in recorded history: Trump keeps insisting he\u2019ll commit a bunch of war crimes, but other than that he\u2019s as anti-war as they come! That\u2019s the thing with Donald Trump: every foreign policy position he\u2019s ever taken appears to be made up \u2013 just like his famous statement about being \u201ctotally against the war in Iraq\u201d, which Dowd also uncritically repeated. The only recorded comments from Trump before the Iraq war consist of him supporting it. The same thing goes for the Libya military intervention in 2011, which he also claims he was against, despite publicly stating at the time that he was in favor it. When he\u2019s not outright lying about his past statements, he\u2019s totally changing them: Months ago he claimed he\u2019d cut the military budget, but he now keeps saying he\u2019d increase it. He told the New York Times in March that the \u201cbiggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation\u201d. Yet he also said last week that the US should expand its arsenal, he wouldn\u2019t rule out using nukes against Isis in Europe, and he recently said South Korea and Japan should get nuclear bombs. Last Wednesday, he blamed Barack Obama for the Egyptian revolution that swept dictator Hosni Mubarak from power. But surprise, surprise: in 2011, he said Mubarak\u2019s ouster was \u201ca good thing\u201d and that Obama wasn\u2019t to blame for what happened there. It\u2019s not just foreign policy, though. Trump\u2019s domestic agenda is so riddled with contradictions that it\u2019s hard to find a topic upon which he hasn\u2019t totally flip-flopped. Last month, he had as many as five different positions in three days on whether to punish women for abortions. (Years ago he was \u201cvery\u201d pro-choice, but now his baseline is \u201cabsolutely pro-life\u201d.) He was once a vocal opponent of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, and now he says that states shouldn\u2019t even be able to legalize marijuana. He was once an advocate for gun control; now he calls anything remotely restricting access to guns an assault on the second amendment. But Trump doesn\u2019t only tack right; he\u2019s moved to the left on other issues during the campaign when advantageous. He called social security a Ponzi scheme in his 2000 book, saying: \u201cPrivatization would be good for all of us.\u201d Now he says he\u2019ll \u201cdo everything within my power not to touch social security, to leave it the way it is.\u201d One day in October 2015, he said Ben Carson\u2019s proposal to do away with Medicare in favor of \u201chealth savings\u201d accounts was \u201ca good idea ... it\u2019s an idea whose probably time has come\u201d. The day after, he told MSNBC there\u2019s no way he would abolish Medicare. Even his well-known extreme positions were once completely different. Trump has notoriously claimed we should not let any Syrian refugees into the country. Yet the first day the Syrian refugee crisis made headlines, he was one of the only Republican candidates to say that the US had an obligation to help. Once his xenophobic crowds started booing, he quickly did a 180. On immigration, he met with Dream activists two years ago and left the meeting saying: \u201cYou convinced me.\u201d That was before he promised to deport 11 million people. There\u2019s more: H-1B visas, Obamacare, the flat tax, even his feelings on Monica Lewinsky. Google any topic that could possibly come up during the campaign \u2013 there\u2019s almost no doubt Donald Trump has held at least two positions on it. None of this seems to matter to his core supporters. His GOP opponents tried to criticize him for one flip-flop or another during the primary season, even his past support and good words for Hillary Clinton, and he vanquished all of them one by one. But it should at least matter to journalists reporting on him and pundits attempting to analyze his nonexistent positions.",

Yet for some reason, he keeps getting credited with having principled beliefs. </p> <p>The latest example was in Sunday\u2019s New York Times, where columnist <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/opinion/sunday/donald-the-dove-hillary-the-hawk.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region&amp;_r=0\">Maureen Dowd</a> <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/11/politics/donald-trump-deportation-force-debate-immigration/\">referred to Donald Trump</a> as a foreign policy \u201cdove\u201d \u2013 or at least less hawkish than Hillary Clinton \u2013 because he\u2019s made a few comments, most recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/27/no-anti-war-candidate-presidential-election-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">last week</a>, about not starting additional wars in the Middle East.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/27/no-anti-war-candidate-presidential-election-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">Donald Trump's foreign policy speech proves: we have no anti-war candidates  | Trevor Timm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dowd eventually undermines her own argument, since he is nowhere close to anything of the sort. Three quarters of the way down her column lauding \u201cDonald The Dove\u201d, almost as an afterthought, she adds: \u201cHe can sound belligerent, of course, saying that he would bomb the expletive-deleted out of Isis and that he would think up new and imaginative ways to torture terrorists and kill their families.\u201d</p> <p>That has to be one of the most ridiculous \u201cto be sure\u201d paragraphs in recorded history: <em>Trump keeps insisting he\u2019ll commit a bunch of war crimes, but other than that he\u2019s as anti-war as they come!</em></p> <p>That\u2019s the thing with Donald Trump: every foreign policy position he\u2019s ever taken appears to be made up \u2013 just like his famous statement about being \u201ctotally against the war in Iraq\u201d, which Dowd also uncritically repeated. The only recorded comments from Trump before the Iraq war consist of <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/christophermassie/a-guide-to-donald-trump-early-flip-flops-on-the-iraq-war?utm_term=.oiGABz3ML#.nuyRG5yZM\">him supporting it</a>. The same thing goes for the Libya military intervention in 2011, which he also claims <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-claims-he-didnt-support-libya-intervention-but-he-did?utm_term=.ihnOVrQ7e#.kkZy90qL8\">he was against</a>, despite <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-claims-he-didnt-support-libya-intervention-but-he-did?utm_term=.ihnOVrQ7e#.kkZy90qL8\">publicly stating</a> at the time that he was in favor it.</p> <p>When he\u2019s not outright lying about his past statements, he\u2019s totally changing them: Months ago he claimed he\u2019d <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3259011/The-Donald-Doctrine-Donald-Trump-slash-military-spending-sit-watch-happens-Syria.html\">cut the military budget</a>, but he now keeps saying he\u2019d <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/03/09/trump-i-would-increase-military-spending/\">increase it</a>. He told the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/us/politics/donald-trump-transcript.html\">New York Times in March</a> that the \u201cbiggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation\u201d. Yet he also said last week that the US should expand its arsenal, he wouldn\u2019t rule out using nukes against Isis <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2016/03/donald-trump-nuclear-weapons-europe\">in Europe</a>, and he recently <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/g00//news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/04/06/should-more-countries-have-nuclear-weapons-donald-trump-thinks-so/\">said South Korea and Japan</a> should get nuclear bombs.</p> <p>Last Wednesday, he <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-in-2011-praised-hosni-mubaraks-ouster-as-a-good-thing?utm_term=.linWDen9v#.cmOdBPbvV\">blamed Barack Obama for the Egyptian</a> revolution that swept dictator Hosni Mubarak from power. But surprise, surprise: in 2011, he said Mubarak\u2019s ouster was \u201ca good thing\u201d and that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedAndrew/status/725405124357660672\">Obama wasn\u2019t to blame</a> for what happened there.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just foreign policy, though. Trump\u2019s domestic agenda is so riddled with contradictions that it\u2019s hard to find a topic upon which he hasn\u2019t totally flip-flopped.</p> <p>Last month, he had as many as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/03/donald-trumps-ever-shifting-positions-on-abortion/\">five different positions</a> in three days on whether to punish women for abortions. (Years ago <a href=\"http://liveactionnews.org/donald-trump-abortion-muddle/\">he was</a> \u201cvery\u201d pro-choice, but now his baseline is \u201cabsolutely pro-life\u201d.) He was <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-04-15/news/9001310473_1_donald-trump-drug-czars-enforcement-efforts\">once a vocal opponent</a> of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, and now he says that <a href=\"http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/top-issues-on-which-trump-flip-flopped/\">states shouldn\u2019t even be able</a> to legalize marijuana. He was <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/01/27/donald-trump-in-2000-i-support-the-ban-on-assault-weapons/\">once an advocate</a> for gun control; now he calls anything <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/02/politics/donald-trump-obama-guns/\">remotely restricting access to guns</a> an assault on the second amendment.</p> <p>But Trump doesn\u2019t only tack right; he\u2019s moved to the left on other issues during the campaign when advantageous. He <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-on-social-security-in-his-2000-book-a-ponzi-scheme-we?utm_term=.jq27Odp0Z#.la3k5l0g4\">called social security a Ponzi scheme</a> in his 2000 book, saying: \u201cPrivatization would be good for all of us.\u201d Now he <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://takeastand.aarp.org/candidate/donald-trump/\">says he\u2019ll</a> \u201cdo everything within my power not to touch social security, to leave it the way it is.\u201d One day in October 2015, he said Ben Carson\u2019s proposal to do away with Medicare in favor of \u201chealth savings\u201d accounts was \u201ca good idea ... it\u2019s an idea whose probably time has come\u201d. The day after, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-views-medicare-program-worked/story?id=34759891\">he told MSNBC</a> there\u2019s no way he would abolish Medicare.</p> <p>Even his well-known extreme positions were once completely different. Trump has notoriously claimed we should not let any Syrian refugees into the country. Yet the first day the Syrian refugee crisis made headlines, he was one of the only Republican candidates to say that the US <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/trump-reverses-himself-accepting-syrian-migrants\">had an obligation to help</a>. Once his xenophobic crowds started booing, he <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/trump-reverses-himself-accepting-syrian-migrants\">quickly did a 180</a>. On immigration, he <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/adriancarrasquillo/that-time-donald-trump-had-a-meeting-with-dreamers-and-said?utm_term=.wo8oyJLbz#.kl0z0BVmk\">met with Dream activists</a> two years ago and left the meeting saying: \u201cYou convinced me.\u201d That was before he promised to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/11/politics/donald-trump-deportation-force-debate-immigration/\">deport 11 million people</a>.</p> <p>There\u2019s more: <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/g00//news/fact-checker/wp/2016/03/21/donald-trump-flip-flops-then-flips-and-flops-more-on-h-1b-visas/\">H-1B visas</a>, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-flip-flops-on-obamacare-mandate-in-less-than-24-hours/article/2583703\">Obamacare</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/donald-trump-flip-flops-on-flat-tax-in-literally-less-than-one-minute/\">the flat tax</a>, even his feelings on <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-defended-clinton-during-lewinsky-scandal-against-moral\">Monica Lewinsky</a>. Google any topic that could possibly come up during the campaign \u2013 there\u2019s almost no doubt Donald Trump has held at least two positions on it.</p> <p>None of this seems to matter to his core supporters. His GOP opponents tried to criticize him for one flip-flop or another during the primary season, even <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/donald-trump-donations-democrats-hillary-clinton-119071\">his past support and good words</a> for Hillary Clinton, and he vanquished all of them one by one. But it should at least matter to journalists reporting on him and pundits attempting to analyze his nonexistent positions. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Bernie Sanders is not ready to discuss his campaign in the past tense. \u201cI am not into legacy,\u201d he told the Guardian on Sunday when asked to sum up his lasting achievements after a year of insurgency. \u201cI hope my legacy will be that I was a very good president of the United States.\u201d To critics, the defiance that marked the campaign\u2019s first anniversary this weekend may smack of hubris bordering on the delusional. After Hillary Clinton stretched her delegate lead again last week with strong wins on the east coast, many Democrats are calling for reconciliation instead. But for the Bernie faithful, fighting talk remains entirely reasonable. Sanders trails by 55 to 45% among pledged delegates and acknowledges it will be an \u201cuphill\u201d struggle to win the 65% of those remaining needed to turn the nomination race around. Yet he believes a favourable set of final states means this mathematical possibility should not be dismissed. \u201cRight now, the next month and a half, we are fighting to win every delegate that we can,\u201d Sanders told reporters earlier in the day, ahead of an Indiana primary on Tuesday that he hopes will begin another string of last minute victories. As for Clinton\u2019s even larger lead among so-called superdelegates \u2013 the party leaders allowed to cast votes independently of election results \u2013 this is simply grist to the mill: proof of a corrupt nomination system, and a target for new pressure from voters in states where Sanders has won biggest. But behind the bluster lies a subtle change in tone in the campaign\u2019s message as it returned to Washington DC this weekend. The first sign of this new, underlying, realism, is a reset of expectations. It is time to stress how far senator has come since he announced his candidacy here a year ago, rather than how much further he still has to go. \u201cIf any of you here would have bet that on May 1, Bernie Sanders would have won 17 primaries and caucuses and if you had the odds I think you would have had a year ago, I don\u2019t think you would be sitting here because you would be very wealthy individuals,\u201d he told reporters at the National Press Club. Then there are the occasional lapses into the past tense and hints that there will plenty of time for reflection in the months to come. \u201cWe are proud of the campaign that we ran,\u201d added Sanders. \u201cFrankly in hindsight you can always think of things that you should have done better, and some day I will tell you all those things.\u201d Even the list of facts and figures reeled out to put pressure on superdelegates are as much about underscoring how the party has already changed as they are a realistic belief that some of Clinton\u2019s most ardent supporters will suddenly now change their minds. Take campaign finance for example. Some Sanders critics leapt at end-of-month figures showing his fundraising among donors slowed to \u201cjust\u201d $26m in April \u2013 something he attributes to most of the key contests now being behind them, but others saw as a sign of the beginning of the end. But with $200m raised from 7.4 million individual donations, the real legacy has arguably already been secured. \u201cWe have shown that you can run a political campaign without the benefit of Super Pacs and big money interests,\u201d explains Sanders. Then there are the 1.1 million supporters who have turned up to rallies in the last year, a total Sanders hopes to add to \u201csignificantly\u201d with a few blow-out final rallies in California before it votes. These may not have been enough to overcome structural obstacles in key states like New York, where independents were not allowed to vote in the Democratic primary, but they point to enthusiasm that Sanders clearly believes will long outlast him. \u201cWe have won, in a state after state, a strong majority of the votes of younger people, voters under 45 years of age,\u201d said the 74-year-old senator. \u201cIn other words, the ideas that we are fighting for are the future of the Democratic party and in fact the future of this country. The reason for that is that the issues that we are talking about are the issues that are on the minds of the American people.\u201d And what are these issues? \u201cPeople know, whether conservative or progressive, that a corrupt campaign finance system is undermining American democracy, they understand that there is something fundamentally wrong when the average American is working longer hours for lower wages,\u201d he said, adding a long list of his stump speech pledges: countering climate change, reforming education and healthcare, breaking up the biggest banks. It is these issues that Sanders intends to promote when he arrives in Philadelphia in July for the party\u2019s national convention. Yes, there will be arcane fights over whether super delegates are reflecting the will of all the voters in all the states, but more importantly, his campaign hopes there will be plenty of agreement too about how much the party has changed on the issues that really matter.",

      "bodyText": "Clement Valla is the kind of curator the Flat Earth Society has been looking for. The artist has taken endless screen grabs of squiffy bridges, melted highways and impossible mountain passes, collecting these errors of Google\u2019s satellite-mapping before they disappear and collating them on his own site, Postcards from Google Earth. The \u201cpostcards\u201d represent the moments when Google\u2019s software has glitched \u2013 inherent flaws in the way the system automatically renders the world \u2013 and pushed together structures that don\u2019t belong on the same plane. So you get the Golden Gate Bridge looking as if the San Andreas Fault has just created a 9.1-magnitude quake. Or the Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona looking as if it were imagined in the 3D graphics engine of the 90s first-person shooter Doom. Valla, who is based in Brooklyn, has long had an interest in what he dubs \u201ccomputer-based picture-producing apparatuses\u201d.

      "bodyText": "For a film to break records before its release is usually a good sign. But such records tend to be for advance ticket sales or most trailer views \u2013 they do not tend to register unusually high levels of online dissatisfaction. When the first look at footage from Paul Feig\u2019s female-fronted Ghostbusters reboot debuted in March, the reaction encompassed outrage not only that the beloved comedy was being remade, but that the lead characters\u2019 genders would be altered. Since then, the hating has not abated, and the first trailer (a second one appeared to address the controversy around the film\u2019s perceived misogyny and racism) has now racked up more than half a million \u201cthumbs down\u201d votes on YouTube. This is not only more than any other trailer: it means the two-and-a-half minute ad earns a place on the streaming channel\u2019s list of the 100 least-liked pieces of content. As the website Screencrush notes, the trailer\u2019s unusual ratio of views to dislikes suggests a concerted campaign to vote down the video. Feig initially called much of the negative reaction to the casting of four women in the leads \u201cvile misogynist shit\u201d, but speaking to the Guardian last week, the director played down the backlash. \u201cThe haters on our trailer were very proud of the fact they had racked up 400,000 [currently 600,000] dislikes on YouTube versus 200,000 likes. But [given the number of views] that\u2019s not a majority by anybody standards. Some of it is that people don\u2019t want an old property touched \u2013 I\u2019m sympathetic to that. But the ones who are hating it because it\u2019s about women? That\u2019s just a non-starter.\u201d Feig pointed a finger at the media which amplify this negativity, and for funnelling \u201ca small minority of voices into a sort of bullhorn\u201d. \u201cIt makes me sad that [the negativity surround Ghostbusters] informs every article now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always some comment about how people are down on it. Well, somebody is down on everything. It\u2019s very easy once you\u2019re predisposed to be pissed about something, to watch it and find fault.\u201d",

This is not only more than any other trailer: it means the two-and-a-half minute ad earns a place on the streaming channel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLirAqAtl_h2o1ism1dr5SbvB8Mf7Ve6Aa\">list of the 100 least-liked pieces of content</a>. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ugHP-yZXw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w3ugHP-yZXw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>As the website Screencrush <a href=\"http://screencrush.com/ghostbusters-trailer-most-disliked-movie-trailer-in-history/\">notes</a>, the trailer\u2019s unusual ratio of views to dislikes suggests a concerted campaign to vote down the video. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/01/who-ya-gonna-call-why-ghostbusters-is-leading-the-charge-for-female-buddy-movies\">Who ya gonna call?

But [given the number of views] that\u2019s not a majority by anybody standards. Some of it is that people don\u2019t want an old property touched \u2013 I\u2019m sympathetic to that. But the ones who are hating it because it\u2019s about women? That\u2019s just a non-starter.\u201d</p> <p>Feig pointed a finger at the media which amplify this negativity, and for funnelling \u201ca small minority of voices into a sort of bullhorn\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes me sad that [the negativity surround Ghostbusters] informs every article now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always some comment about how people are down on it.

      "bodyText": "What fashion lessons can we learn from Lemonade? Fashion writers everywhere, IRL Well, aside from the fact that Bey is so physically perfect she can even make clothes by Yeezus look good on her, quite a lot, actually. It\u2019s hard for me to remember a pop landscape without Beyonc\u00e9 by this point, but for all her longterm omnipresence, she has long seemed somewhat separate from fashion. She wasn\u2019t associated with a particular look (like Kylie and her hotpants, say, or Missy Elliott and her caps), let alone a designer (Madonna and Gaultier, or Rihanna and Riccardo Tisci.) While she always looked good, she didn\u2019t seem massively interested in using fashion to speak for her. If anything, her style choices seemed as designed to conceal her real self as her notoriously close-lipped interviews. Well, that\u2019s all changed now. The first video that made me think Bey might be changing things up a bit was 7/11, which remains one of my favourite of hers. The clothes look, on the surface, pretty low-key for a music video \u2013 a Givenchy sweatshirt here, Forever 21 leggings there, even a Christmas jumper \u2013 but they felt, for the first time, like Beyonc\u00e9 was, instead of being her usual pop-glamazon self, plugging into the current fashion mood, and making it look better than anyone else could. And now, well. First we had the release of the video Formation, in which Bey wears not just recognisable designer clothes but clothes by Gucci, the label of the moment, taking on the fashion zeitgeist and making herself an inextricable part of it. Now in Lemonade she has done it again, wearing clothes from pretty much everyone, from Gucci (again), Alexander McQueen, Roberto Cavalli, Hood by Air and, um, Yeezus. Then there are the various styles, from southern gothic to Egyptian queen to Victorian antebellum, which all become part of the Lemonade\u2019s story about black women. Lemonade (like 7/11, for that matter) was styled by the brilliant Marni Senofonte, who has previously worked with artists such as Brandy, Mary J Blige and \u2013 pause for a bow before the goddess\u2019s altar \u2013 Lauryn Hill, and I could not endorse her and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s embrace of fashion more. This isn\u2019t because I give a fig about which pop star is wearing which designer, despite the daily thousand emails I get from PRs telling me precisely that (what would a day be without 17 emails informing me what Pixie Lott is wearing hour to hour?) And it certainly isn\u2019t because Bey looked bad before: the woman is clearly the most physically perfect being ever born, and that is a scientific fact. Rather it shows her engaging with the moment and a willingness to show some of herself, as opposed to making perfect if somewhat self-detached pop music. It\u2019s a weird truth, but Bey has never seemed more relatable than since she started breaking out the fashion. And let\u2019s talk about the humanity, shall we? As everyone\u2019s already said, Lemonade is about a lot more than Jay Z\u2019s long-rumoured alleged infidelities, and that\u2019s clearly true. But hey, it is also about that, so let\u2019s look over there for a second. There have already been some pathetic attempts by various no-listers to suggest that they are \u201cBecky with the good hair\u201d, only for some hilariously quick retrenching on their part once they felt the wrath of the righteous Beyhive. Anyone who actually bothers to listen to the album could figure out that \u201cBecky with the good hair\u201d is not just one woman but a composite (\u201cThey don\u2019t love you like I do\u201d \u2013 the clue is in the second song, fools!) I\u2019m more struck by Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s term for her husband\u2019s maybe, alleged, possible etc etc mistress(es): \u201cBecky with the good hair\u201d suggests, by extension, that Beyonc\u00e9 feels she doesn\u2019t have good hair, as though it\u2019s in the tonsorial department that this other woman beats her. The idea of Beyonc\u00e9 being insecure about anything is almost as incomprehensible as the thought of anyone cheating on her, but, as I said, she is showing us quite a lot of humanity these days. So there we have it: in Lemonade, Beyonc\u00e9 shows how she is using fashion both to engage with us and also engage us in the issues she\u2019s working through, from black feminism to her marriage. She also shows her vulnerability and relatability because, dammit, what woman isn\u2019t insecure about their hair? Only an evil woman, that\u2019s who. Team Beyonc\u00e9! Like there was ever any doubt, anyway.",

      "bodyText": "Long-time Labour supporter Emma Thompson is urging London voters to back the Women\u2019s Equality party in Thursday\u2019s elections. The Oscar-winning actor told the Guardian that while she still supports Jeremy Corbyn, she feels issues that are important to women, including equal pay, are sidelined from mainstream politics. \u201cI just got to the point where I thought, I\u2019m 57, I have voted Labour all my life, I have spent my life living and working in the capital, and I can safely say I have never known it worse,\u201d she said. \u201cI am just so disappointed in our political landscape and what we have done in the last 30 years: it is with great sadness that I say that.\u201d She added: \u201cI don\u2019t feel spoken to by Labour.\u201d In a letter to the Guardian, she said her generation expected as they grew up to see women taking on an equal role in all walks of life, including politics, and looked forward to the transformation that would bring. \u201cTo be sure, there have been some good shifts but by and large, the dreams of my generation have not been realised and many of our hopes have been dashed,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am backing the Women\u2019s Equality party because I really do not want to die before closing the pay gap, which stands, in our great and supposedly modern capital city, at 23%.\u201d She argued the inequality between men and women was at the root of other socioeconomic divisions in London; but tackling it got left off the agenda because it was not a \u201cglamorous\u201d issue. \u201cWhat I feel is that politics has these glamorous subjects that people want to go on about \u2013 including this fucking war on terror \u2013 and all of the things that make politicians feel important.\u201d Thompson, who won the Oscar for best actress for Howard\u2019s End, and another for her screenplay of Sense and Sensibility, in which she also starred, has long campaigned for human rights and other political causes. As well as giving the WEP her vote, she now plans to work with the party on issues including improving sex education. The mayoral contest in London has become increasingly bitter in its final weeks, with the Conservative candidate, Zac Goldsmith, alleging that Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan is a \u201cradical\u201d who has shared a platform with Muslim extremists. The WEP is fielding a candidate \u2013 Sophie Walker \u2013 in the mayoral race, but is also calling on voters from across the political spectrum to use their votes in the separate London assembly poll to show support for its agenda, including forcing faster progress towards equal pay, tackling domestic violence and providing better support for women with caring responsibilities. \u201cI am backing them because I have met and talked with them and a more committed, bright, inspiring bunch of women with fantastic ideas I have never found,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI am inspired by Jeremy Corbyn, but I feel like I need to do something new.\u201d The London assembly elections use a proportional voting system, and the WEP hopes that by winning the backing of voters who may have given their first vote to a different candidate, it can attract enough support from across the capital to secure a seat. But Thompson made clear she would be supporting the party in the mayoral race and where they are standing in the London wide list - part of the assembly\u2019s proportional element. The WEP was founded by the broadcaster Sandi Toksvig and the journalist Catherine Mayer, out of frustration at the slow pace of progress in tackling some of the problems that prevent women playing a full role in Britain\u2019s economic and political life. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 May 2016. An earlier version stated that Thompson would be using \u201call\u201d her votes on the WEP. The party is not contesting any of the assembly constituencies \u2013 only the London-wide list.",

Thomas wakes up to find himself in a maze surrounded by other teenage boys who call themselves the Gladers; he doesn\u2019t remember anything about his life before coming to the maze apart from his name. Just like Thomas, the other Gladers also have no clue as to who put them in the maze, why they are there, what happened to the outside world and they don\u2019t even remember their last names. Then begins Thomas\u2019s riveting journey to explore the horrors of the maze and find a way to escape it. Some might think the book progressed slowly but I love the way James Dashner builds up the progression of the story, it keeps you intrigued. There are many characters in the book which make it interesting but I think their personalities could have been given more emphasis - I guess I\u2019ll find out more about the characters as I proceed along the series. The action and the thrill in this book... I can\u2019t even describe it. All I can say is the book is a page turner. Even though I watched the film and had a rough idea of what was about to happen, reading it was a whole lot spectacular.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A Conservative cabinet minister has made a direct plea to supporters of other political parties to vote in favour of Britain\u2019s membership of the EU by warning that Brexit would be a \u201chugely retrograde step\u201d for the environment. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, the environment secretary, Liz Truss, said the referendum was too important to be dominated by internal Tory politics. Truss argued that the EU was responsible for major global breakthroughs such as the dramatic reduction in the levels of acid rain and reducing the hole in the world\u2019s ozone layer. The fact that the UK shared its air and oceans with European countries, and that 80% of birds migrated across borders, meant that continued collaboration was essential, she added. \u201cWhat would I say to readers of the Guardian is that this isn\u2019t just a debate in the Conservative party \u2013 that is for me a very small part of it. This is a debate about our country. People who care about those issues, who care about us being an outward-facing, internationally-focused country, go out and vote,\u201d said Truss. The minister singled out the Labour party, urging its voters not to let the controversy engulfing it distract them from the \u201cvital decision on 23 June\u201d. \u201cThis is bigger than party politics,\u201d she added. It came as Truss faced criticism from Eurosceptic MPs after signing up to a declaration with the former Labour leader Ed Miliband, the former Liberal Democrat energy secretary Ed Davey and the Green MP, Caroline Lucas, describing Brexit campaigners as \u201cextreme and outdated\u201d. Miliband said the four had put together an unprecedented partnership in order to fight for the environment. They published a pamphlet that accused leave campaigners of dismissing vital green policies and climate change as \u201cmumbo jumbo\u201d, and said EU collaboration was the only hope in tackling global warming. But Gisela Stuart, the Labour MP who chairs Vote Leave, accused Truss and others of \u201cdescending into absurdity\u201d. \u201cIt seems there is no good in the world that they cannot somehow attribute to the EU and no imagined disaster they cannot predict if we vote leave.\u201d But Truss told the Guardian that she believed working with countries that were closest geographically was key, not least because industrial operations across Europe were causing pollution in the UK. \u201cWe share our air. Up to 50% of all particulate matter in UK air comes from the European continent,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a classic tragedy of the commons: you produce pollution but you are not feeling the full effect of it so that is why we need to work together.\u201d She claimed that membership of the EU had helped shore up depleted stocks of fish such as cod; cleaned up the sea and beaches; helped reduce the illegal trade of ivory and rhino horns; and contributed to tackling animal disease. She also said it was responsibly for cutting sulphur dioxide levels by 94% leading to the \u201cend of the threat of acid rain, which was destroying forests and historic buildings\u201d. Truss said that Margaret Thatcher\u2019s push for the Montreal protocol had helped address the hole in the ozone layer. She claimed that membership of the EU magnified Britain\u2019s global influence. \u201cWhen you are speaking for 500 million people that really carries weight.\u201d The environment secretary also claimed that farmers would be \u201cmuch better off remaining in a reformed EU\u201d, a view that contradicts George Eustice, who is not just a Conservative colleague but the farming minister within her own department. He recently welcomed a survey by Farmers Weekly that found 58% of farmers would vote for Brexit, while 31% wanted to see Britain remain in the EU. \u201cIt is no surprise that farmers want to leave the EU. Virtually every problem they bring to me is a direct consequence of dysfunctional EU rules and regulations,\u201d said Eustice, who is a prominent out campaigner. He also challenged the latest collaboration with Miliband, saying Brexit would allow Britain to regain control. Truss would not comment on Eustice personally but said farmers benefited from common rules and said trade in the food industry was worth billions, with Europe the easiest market to reach. \u201cIf you look at export products like beef or lamb to the US we are still not in that market 20 years later.\u201d She said the key debate was over what sort of country Britain wanted to be. \u201dThat is a really important question rather than what is happening in the Conservative party... It doesn\u2019t matter what party people vote for.\u201d Sam Lowe, of Friends of the Earth, welcomed the intervention saying that climate change affected everyone, regardless of their political affiliation. But a Vote Leave spokesman accused Truss of \u201closing all sense of perspective\u201d, and asked why she believed the British government would be unwilling protect the environment in a post-Brexit world. \u201cTackling climate change is a global challenge yet we have allowed our voice at international institutions to be diminished by our EU membership ... It\u2019s time for pro-EU campaigners to stop pretending that Britain \u2013 the fifth largest economy, a science superpower and champion of the green agenda \u2013 is powerless outside of the EU.\u201d",

This is a debate about our country. People who care about those issues, who care about us being an outward-facing, internationally-focused country, go out and vote,\u201d said Truss.</p> <p>The minister singled out the Labour party, urging its voters not to let the controversy engulfing it distract them from the \u201cvital decision on <a>23 June</a>\u201d. \u201cThis is bigger than party politics,\u201d she added. </p> <p>It came as Truss faced criticism from Eurosceptic MPs after signing up to a declaration with the former Labour leader Ed Miliband, the former Liberal Democrat energy secretary Ed Davey and the Green MP, Caroline Lucas, describing Brexit campaigners as \u201cextreme and outdated\u201d.</p> <p>Miliband said the four had put together an unprecedented partnership in order to fight for the environment. They published a pamphlet that accused leave campaigners of dismissing vital green policies and climate change as \u201cmumbo jumbo\u201d, and said EU collaboration was the only hope in tackling global warming.</p> <p>But Gisela Stuart, the Labour MP who chairs Vote Leave, accused Truss and others of \u201cdescending into absurdity\u201d. \u201cIt seems there is no good in the world that they cannot somehow attribute to the EU and no imagined disaster they cannot predict if we vote leave.\u201d</p> <p>But Truss told the Guardian that she believed working with countries that were closest geographically was key, not least because industrial operations across Europe were causing pollution in the UK. </p> <p>\u201cWe share our air. Up to 50% of all particulate matter in UK air comes from the European continent,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a classic tragedy of the commons: you produce pollution but you are not feeling the full effect of it so that is why we need to work together.\u201d</p> <p>She claimed that membership of the EU had helped shore up depleted stocks of fish such as cod; cleaned up the sea and beaches; helped reduce the illegal trade of ivory and rhino horns; and contributed to tackling animal disease.</p> <p>She also said it was responsibly for cutting sulphur dioxide levels by 94% leading to the \u201cend of the threat of acid rain, which was destroying forests and historic buildings\u201d. Truss said that Margaret Thatcher\u2019s push for the Montreal protocol had helped address the hole in the ozone layer. </p> <p>She claimed that membership of the EU magnified Britain\u2019s global influence. \u201cWhen you are speaking for 500 million people that really carries weight.\u201d</p> <p>The environment secretary also claimed that farmers would be \u201cmuch better off remaining in a reformed EU\u201d, a view that contradicts George Eustice, who is not just a Conservative colleague but the farming minister within her own department. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?sheet=beginner&amp;id=why\" data-alt=\"Brexit Companion\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?sheet=beginner&id=why\">Brexit Companion</a> </figure>  <p>He recently <a href=\"http://www.fwi.co.uk/news/george-eustice-sets-out-vision-for-farming-life-outside-eu.htm\">welcomed</a> a survey by Farmers Weekly that found 58% of farmers would vote for Brexit, while 31% wanted to see Britain remain in the EU. \u201cIt is no surprise that farmers want to leave the EU. Virtually every problem they bring to me is a direct consequence of dysfunctional EU rules and regulations,\u201d said Eustice, who is a prominent out campaigner.</p> <p>He also challenged the latest collaboration with Miliband, saying Brexit would allow Britain to regain control. Truss would not comment on Eustice personally but said farmers benefited from common rules and said trade in the food industry was worth billions, with Europe the easiest market to reach.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at export products like beef or lamb to the US we are still not in that market 20 years later.\u201d</p> <p>She said the key debate was over what sort of country Britain wanted to be. \u201dThat is a really important question rather than what is happening in the Conservative party... It doesn\u2019t matter what party people vote for.\u201d</p> <p>Sam Lowe, of Friends of the Earth, welcomed the intervention saying that climate change affected everyone, regardless of their political affiliation.<br /></p> <p>But a Vote Leave spokesman accused Truss of \u201closing all sense of perspective\u201d, and asked why she believed the British government would be unwilling protect the environment in a post-Brexit world. </p> <p>\u201cTackling climate change is a global challenge yet we have allowed our voice at international institutions to be diminished by our EU membership ... It\u2019s time for pro-EU campaigners to stop pretending that Britain \u2013 the fifth largest economy, a science superpower and champion of the green agenda \u2013 is powerless outside of the EU.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you live in Britain, and you\u2019re enjoying day three of the bank holiday weekend, you may already be dreading going back to work \u2013 not just the grind of the office or factory, but the misery of getting there. If you\u2019re not jammed into an overcrowded, unpunctual train or bus, you\u2019ll be struggling with jams and roadworks in your car, or trying not to be crushed by a lorry on your bike. It\u2019s no better if you\u2019re taking the kids to school or popping to the shops. Thanks to a combination of hypermobility and underinvestment, even the shortest journey can take you to hell and back. The thing is, it\u2019s partly our fault. We\u2019ve become so used to the idea that getting anywhere requires machinery, even if it\u2019s something as basic as a bike, that many of us have forgotten the original means of transport. That\u2019s right \u2013 our feet. A survey by the charity Living Streets, reported this morning, finds that almost half of Britons are unwilling to walk for 20 minutes, while a 2014 National Travel Survey, found that walking in England has fallen by almost a third since the mid-1990s. It\u2019s still the most popular way to cover distances of up to a mile, but beyond that we\u2019d rather take the car, train or bus. If you\u2019re not sure how long it takes to walk a mile, the route-planning website walkit.com suggests 20 minutes at a medium pace. In other words, if it would take us longer to walk somewhere than to cook a portion of oven chips, the vast majority of us can\u2019t be arsed. At a time of growing obesity and air pollution, we\u2019d rather burn fuel and conserve our fat reserves. If you\u2019re a walker yourself, it\u2019s depressing to sit on a bus and watch apparently healthy people travel just one or two stops (and I write as someone whose mother used to get in the car to visit the next-door neighbour.) You can\u2019t help wondering how long they\u2019ll stay well. In addition to obesity, walking has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, type-2 diabetes, asthma, strokes and some cancers. As far as commuting\u2019s concerned, many journeys are too long for feet alone. In England and Wales the average commute is 9.3 miles (15km). But if you are at least moderately fit, and willing to bust the one-mile barrier and add a decent walk to the mixture, new possibilities open up. My own daily journey from south to central London, for example, is about eight miles as the crow flies, or perhaps two and a half hours on foot. If you don\u2019t have time to walk that every day \u2013 and who does? \u2013 the obvious alternatives combine an initial five- or 10-minute stroll with some multi-part combination of bus, train and tube. After a year of experimenting, I know that it\u2019s far more pleasant to walk either 25 minutes to the fourth-nearest railway station, or 50 minutes to the nearest tube, at which point I have a direct journey to my destination, no changes involved. It adds 10-20 minutes to my overall commute, but halves the number of weak links. My legs always work, whatever\u2019s going on with leaves on the line, signal failures, passengers taken sick or shortage of train crew. So long as I leave home on time, one part of the commute is sure to be stress-free. Like many cities, London does as little as possible to help walkers. Not only are there too few pedestrian crossings, subways and bridges, with motorists blatantly given priority, but signage ranges from the non-existent to barely adequate. Meanwhile, the most widely available and prominently displayed map \u2013 of tube lines and suburban rail services \u2013 does an impressive job of explaining which line(s) will take you to which station(s), but gives a completely misleading impression of walking times between them, should you get into your head that you\u2019d rather see a little daylight as you travel around. The result is that many of us experience the city as an archipelago of remote islands, each centred around a tube or rail station. Meanwhile, outgoing mayor Boris Johnson obsesses about cycling, alternately patting himself on the back for encouraging it and fretting about its future once he is gone. When the listings magazine Time Out suggested he was going to introduce a congestion charge for pedestrians entering the West End, the April fool was all too believable. With Britons getting fatter and the air getting filthier, you\u2019d think officials would be pulling out all the stops to tempt us off cars, trains and buses. \u201cIf we all swapped one weekly drive for walking,\u201d the charity Sustrans says, \u201ctraffic would reduce by at least 10%. Imagine that.\u201d Yes, imagine that. There would be some investment required, to properly maintain pavements or even create them on some country roads, to vastly increase the numbers of crossings, and to shower walkers with free maps, just like bus and tube passengers. In the short term, we\u2019d probably need a walking tsar to get things started, a big publicity campaign to remind people what those things at the end of their legs are meant for, and an army of volunteers to get the idle back on their feet. We might even need to buy proper shoes for those who only own high heels or flip-flops. But that shouldn\u2019t be a problem for a nation that can find \u00a3175m to build a \u201cgarden bridge\u201d that nobody wants, or \u00a356bn to speed up journeys between one congested city and another.",

      "bodyText": "Mario Balotelli has phoned Milan\u2019s chief executive, Adriano Galliani, to apologise for missing a penalty in the 3-3 draw against Frosinone at the weekend. Milan were losing 2-0 when Balotelli, on loan from Liverpool, saw his penalty kept out after 48 minutes. Carlos Bacca pulled a goal back for Milan but Federico Dionisi extended the visitors\u2019 lead before Luca Antonelli scored and J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez put away his own penalty in injury-time. Balotelli then hit the bar. Milan, who have won just one of their last nine league matches, dropped to seventh in Serie A. According to Football Italia, Balotelli personally phoned Galliani to apologise for his miss in the hope of making his return to Milan permanent. Galliani confirmed the call when he said: \u201cTo give you an idea of how much Balotelli has changed, I\u2019ll tell you that, 15 or 20 minutes after the game he called me and apologised for having missed the penalty. He was unlucky, he missed the penalty and hit the bar in the 94th minute.\u201d Balotelli said recently he was determined not to go back to Anfield. \u201cWhen it comes to my future I want to stay with Milan because I wasn\u2019t happy at Liverpool and I don\u2019t want to return there,\u201d he said. Liverpool paid \u00a316m for the then Italy striker in August 2014 but in his one season at Anfield he scored only four goals in 28 matches, including one in the Premier League. Also according to Football Italia, the Chinese investors interested in buying Milan have told the president Silvio Berlusconi they want an answer to their bid by Wednesday. The Chinese conglomerate is said to have deposited \u20ac150m as a guarantee that it has the financial resources to buy the club. Milan are expected to sell 70% of the club for \u20ac720m (\u00a3564m) and the remaining 30% in 2017.",

      "bodyText": "Cristiano Ronaldo completed Monday\u2019s training session with Real Madrid as he stepped up his bid to be fit for the Champions League semi-final, second leg against Manchester City. Ronaldo sat out last week\u2019s goalless draw at the Etihad Stadium with a thigh injury which also kept him out of Saturday\u2019s 1-0 La Liga win at Real Sociedad in which Gareth Bale scored the only goal. However, the Portugal captain was back in training on Sunday, participating with his team-mates for the first half before working individually for the remainder and he was able to take a full part in Monday\u2019s session. While the news about Ronaldo looks promising for Madrid, it is less clear whether his fellow forward Karim Benzema will be able to feature against City. The France international was replaced at half-time in the first leg against City with a hamstring problem and he was limited to running apart from the rest of the group on Monday. The Madrid midfielder Casemiro, meanwhile, worked indoors after picking up a knock against Sociedad. It was Ronaldo who scored the winner when the sides met during the 2012-13 group stages and the same referee from that match has been appointed for Wednesday night\u2019s game, Damir Skomina of Slovenia. Los Blancos won 3-2 on that occasion in September 2012, despite going behind twice, and similar result would earn Zinedine Zidane\u2019s side a place in the final following last week\u2019s stalemate at the Etihad. Edin Dzeko and Aleksandar Kolarov had put City ahead but Marcelo and Benzema pulled Madrid level before Ronaldo won the game in injury-time . Skomina, who became an international referee in 2003, was in charge for Manchester City\u2019s 2-1 home defeat by Juventus earlier in the season.",

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s always a buzz at Breakin\u2019 Convention. For 13 years, the hip-hop dance weekender has filled Sadler\u2019s Wells with a young, upbeat and vocal crowd, egged on by the festival\u2019s affable founder and director Jonzi D. Opening the Sunday night programme were festival favourites Boy Blue Entertainment, whose Emancipation of Expressionism 2 showcases the astonishing technical and performative skill of their youthful cast. Sleek, super-synchronised and superbly disciplined, they wind themselves into tense knots and explode in stuttering steps that pinpoint every beat, bodies strafed by lights and smoke. The following duet, Kaleidoscope by Sharifa Tonkmor and Maren Ellermann, doesn\u2019t quite achieve the same exactness, but its doll-like articulations and angular, floor-bound actions give it a more offbeat, unconventional look. Antoinette Gomis (France), Iron Skulls (Spain) and the Ruggeds (Netherlands) reprise pieces shown in last year\u2019s festival. Gomis\u2019s Images portrays a woman\u2019s journey from subjugation towards self-esteem. It\u2019s a powerful subject but the choreography is slight; Gomis dances well enough \u2013 from hesitant gesticulations through to weighty, full-bodied freedom \u2013 but for depth and discovery all you need is the Nina Simone soundtrack. The masked Iron Skulls troupe invade the stage from the auditorium in their soldierly Sinestesia. The work wavers between stagey effects (wandering searchlights, white clouds, massed movements) and moments of emotional force (stylised jitters, parachuting jumps, images of combat and capitulation). The Ruggeds\u2019 Adrenaline also opens with an overly militaristic feel, but a bebop track later releases the dancers into a fluid, personable dynamic: they ping goofily off gym balls and spin like teetering gyroscopes, their stunts and tricks as enjoyable as they are impressive. In their slightly wearing Womano\u00efde, the French female quartet Bandidas portray a squad of silvery space robots, pounding the ground to an assaultive beat like video-game androids. Hip-hop choreography can tend towards militarism, with drilled formations, battle scenes, uniform costumes, but the French company Enfants Prodiges steer clear of such overtones with deft touches of slapstick (head-butting an invisible force field), casual showmanship (one man seems to walk up a wall made of air) and sheer flair. The two surprise acts of the night could not be more different. The rubber-limbed Soweto Skeleton Movers, from South Africa, have an utterly disarming style called pantsula that is rough-hewn, knockabout and playful. With a bounce in their steps and looks of mischief, they twizzle into pretzels, play amazing tricks with floating hats and turn their limbs into skipping ropes and Hula Hoops. In contrast, the rising British choreographer Ivan Blackstock explores violence, alienation and ritual in an excerpt of his forthcoming work Traplord of the Flyz. Nightmarish images meld with ominous rap and a potent physicality: a pig mask, the puff and glow of narcotics, black men in blackface, the body as a battleground. Blackstock is one to watch: this is not hip-hop adapted for theatre; it\u2019s theatre expressed through hip-hop. \u2022 At Cast, Doncaster, on 7 May. Box office: 01302 303 959. Then touring until 1 June.",

      "bodyText": "The leader of Welsh Labour, Carwyn Jones, was at Bridgend College to speak about his party\u2019s manifesto pledge to create 100,000 all-age apprenticeships. He chatted with young would-be plumbers and carpenters, and got his hands dirty having a go at bricklaying. But then, as so often, he had to veer off-piste to answer a barrage of questions about subjects other than those in the control of the Welsh assembly, including the allegations of antisemitism within Labour; the credibility of Jeremy Corbyn and the EU referendum. In short, Welsh-only topics are not top of everyone\u2019s concerns. \u201cIt can be difficult,\u201d Jones told the Guardian. \u201cThe European issue, in particular, overshadows everything else. We know that the London broadcast media is obsessed with it.\u201d Jones, however, who succeeded Rhodri Morgan as Welsh first minister in 2009 and has been the most senior UK Labour leader since the resignation of Gordon Brown as prime minister the following year, believes more Welsh citizens are engaged in this election campaign. \u201cWhat\u2019s struck me in my fifth campaign is that more people are aware there is an election. They\u2019re not saying, what election? They are much more aware of the election, of devolution,\u201d he said. The fourth Welsh assembly ended in mid-March in shambolic fashion. The Labour government, which ruled with half of the assembly\u2019s 60 seats, suffered an embarrassing defeat over an eye-catching and wide-ranging health bill that included a crackdown on e-cigarettes. Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, had been prepared to back the bill but changed its mind after a Labour minister, in a clumsy attempt at end-of-term humour, called the party a \u201ccheap date\u201d \u2013 suggesting its support was easily won. Five years of work was lost in an instant. It made both parties, and indeed the assembly itself look less than competent, and the Tories, the second biggest party going into this campaign, were champing at the bit. Within days the spat seemed irrelevant. The steel crisis \u2013 centred on Port Talbot, 15 miles along the south coast from Bridgend \u2013 broke, followed by the Panama Papers saga. Then came Corbyn\u2019s problems over antisemitism in the Labour party. Meanwhile, the question of EU membership has swirled around every debate, visit and photo opportunity. Roger Scully, a professor of political science at Cardiff University, said it was unfortunate the campaign had been so overshadowed, likening it to the 2003 election when Welsh-only issues were sidelined by the Iraq war. \u201cIt is a pity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Welsh assembly passes laws and control major areas of public policy like education and the NHS. The way those powers are exercised ought to be subject to proper scrutiny.\u201d He believes Labour may have benefited most from the distractions. \u201cResearch suggests most people in Wales are not particularly impressed by Welsh Labour\u2019s record on health and education \u2026 if people aren\u2019t paying so much attention to those areas, that may help them.\u201d A poll last week suggested Labour would slip to 28 seats, and privately party strategists say they would be content with that result. The poll has the Tories dropping to third place with 10 seats and Plaid leapfrogging them with 13 seats. Jones, who has been assembly member for Bridgend since the first election in 1999, played down the polls. \u201cI\u2019ve learned there are fine margins between success and failure. I do know that we are in very good heart, we\u2019re still out there knocking on doors, meeting people. \u201cWith the work we\u2019re putting in and a bit of luck we can be in the situation we are in now. There are lots of ifs and buts, a lot of factors that nobody can control,\u201d he said. Significantly, Jones is prepared, even now, to think about working with others. \u201cFrom my perspective we couldn\u2019t work with the Tories or Ukip, they are too far to the right of us,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to Plaid and the Lib Dems [who are predicted to plunge from five to two seats], of course we can work with them. We\u2019ve done it in the past. We will look at the situation after Thursday. Our objective is to be in a position where we can govern alone. But if we need to discuss issues with other parties, of course we will.\u201d Plaid and its charismatic leader, Leanne Wood, best known on the national stage for slapping down the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, during one of last year\u2019s general election debates, have run an attractive, positive campaign. Wood told the Guardian that Labour was an uninspiring establishment party. \u201cGiven that we\u2019ve had 17 years of Labour leading the government, they are the establishment. They are stale, tired,\u201d she said. The former probation officer with a rebellious streak, who was once expelled from the Welsh assembly after calling the Queen \u201cMrs Windsor\u201d, would certainly be a colourful character in a coalition government. The Tories are thought to have been badly hit by the Port Talbot crisis and the Panama Papers, but are working hard to refocus the electorate\u2019s attention back to devolved issues. Andrew RT Davies, the Welsh Conservative leader, said people on the doorstep wanted to speak about the issues the assembly had power over. \u201cThey do want to talk about the health service, they do want to talk about education, they do want to talk about job security. Those are all factors that people gladly engage in,\u201d he said. It is certainly true that the BBC leaders\u2019 debate in Cardiff sparked into life when an audience member berated Jones over the contentious subject of treatment for cancer patients, yelling at him: \u201cRhag eich cywilydd!\u201d or \u201cShame on you!\u201d Meanwhile, none of the main parties are ignoring Ukip. The party has never won a seat at the assembly but last week\u2019s poll has Farage\u2019s Welsh arm, for which the former Tory MPs Neil Hamilton and Mark Reckless are standing, winning seven seats \u2013 a result that would fundamentally change the makeup and feel of the assembly. While Jones was visiting Bridgend, half an hour down the M4 in Newport two Ukip stalwarts were busy refurbishing a 1930s art deco cinema, which is being rebranded as The Neon - Newport entertains our nation \u2013 a venue for gigs, comedy and films. Andy Byers, the secretary of the city\u2019s Ukip branch, and James Peterson, the candidate for Newport East, are lapsed Labour voters who believe their new party is the true champion of the working man and woman. Byers, who grew up in Greater Manchester, said he had been attracted by Ukip\u2019s \u201ccommonsense\u201d approach. \u201cI love my country, I\u2019m a monarchist. All the other parties seem to be eroding our British identity. It bothers me that we\u2019re losing that.\u201d Peterson, who once worked at the Llanwern steelworks in Newport, where his father was a union representative, said though it was not a devolved issue, border control was the big talking point in the area. \u201cWhen you say you\u2019re from Ukip people want to talk about immigration. I think it\u2019s because Ukip is the only party addressing it. I listen to their concerns and then talk about the issues that are devolved, like the NHS. But with Ukip there are no taboo subjects. If you speak to a Labour or Lib Dem person and mention immigration, you\u2019re shot down in flames,\u201d he said. As in the north of England, Ukip is expected to do well in places such as Newport among white working-class former Labour voters. It would be a major surprise if they did not win a seat here. This may be an election overshadowed by nationwide and worldwide issues, but that does not mean the Welsh electorate is unengaged. One of the apprentice carpenters at Bridgend, Luke Cavill, 20, was looking forward to voting for the first time. \u201cThe assembly makes decisions that affect the lives of all people in Wales. Of course I\u2019ll be voting. This is important.\u201d",

The former probation officer with a rebellious streak, who was once <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/23/leanne-wood-wales-plaid-cymru\">expelled from the Welsh assembly after calling the Queen \u201cMrs Windsor\u201d</a>, would certainly be a colourful character in a coalition government. </p> <p>The Tories are thought to have been badly hit by the Port Talbot crisis and the Panama Papers, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/18/welsh-tories-income-tax-cancer-drug-fund-wales-assembly-elections-manifesto\">are working hard to refocus the electorate\u2019s attention back to devolved issues. </a></p> <p>Andrew RT Davies, the Welsh Conservative leader, said people on the doorstep wanted to speak about the issues the assembly had power over. \u201cThey do want to talk about the health service, they do want to talk about education, they do want to talk about job security. Those are all factors that people gladly engage in,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It is certainly true that the BBC leaders\u2019 debate in Cardiff sparked into life when an audience member berated Jones over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/09/how-healthcare-differs-across-the-uk\">contentious subject of treatment for cancer patients</a>, yelling at him: \u201c<em>Rhag eich cywilydd</em>!\u201d or \u201cShame on you!\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2fb37e9ad58b84bc514aba32f6854224a9ff0513\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fb37e9ad58b84bc514aba32f6854224a9ff0513/0_0_3066_4252/721.jpg\" alt=\"Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood.\" width=\"721\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Plaid Cymru leader, Leanne Wood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Ansell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, none of the main parties are ignoring Ukip. The party has never won a seat at the assembly but last week\u2019s poll has Farage\u2019s Welsh arm, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/07/neil-hamilton-mark-reckless-ukip-welsh-assembly-elections\">for which the former Tory MPs Neil Hamilton and Mark Reckless are standing,</a> winning seven seats \u2013 a result that would fundamentally change the makeup and feel of the assembly. <br /></p> <p>While Jones was visiting Bridgend, half an hour down the M4 in Newport two Ukip stalwarts were busy <a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/newports-historic-art-deco-odeon-10561489\">refurbishing a 1930s art deco cinema</a>, which is being rebranded as The Neon - Newport entertains our nation \u2013 a venue for gigs, comedy and films. Andy Byers, the secretary of the city\u2019s Ukip branch, and <a href=\"http://%20http//ukip.wales/candidate-profile/james-peterson/\">James Peterson</a>, the candidate for Newport East, are lapsed Labour voters who believe their new party is the true champion of the working man and woman. </p> <p>Byers, who grew up in Greater Manchester, said he had been attracted by Ukip\u2019s \u201ccommonsense\u201d approach. \u201cI love my country, I\u2019m a monarchist. All the other parties seem to be eroding our British identity. It bothers me that we\u2019re losing that.\u201d </p> <p>Peterson, who once worked at the Llanwern steelworks in Newport, where his father was a union representative, said though it was not a devolved issue, border control was the big talking point in the area. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62a70635b3dd2e884134ca5f8de9d7f4a8df1ded\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62a70635b3dd2e884134ca5f8de9d7f4a8df1ded/0_152_3608_2165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukip leader Nigel Farage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Ukip leader, Nigel Farage.

I think it\u2019s because Ukip is the only party addressing it. I listen to their concerns and then talk about the issues that are devolved, like the NHS. But with Ukip there are no taboo subjects. If you speak to a Labour or Lib Dem person and mention immigration, you\u2019re shot down in flames,\u201d he said.</p> <p>As in the north of England, Ukip is expected to do well in places such as Newport among white working-class former Labour voters. It would be a major surprise if they did not win a seat here. </p> <p>This may be an election overshadowed by nationwide and worldwide issues, but that does not mean the Welsh electorate is unengaged. One of the apprentice carpenters at Bridgend, Luke Cavill, 20, was looking forward to voting for the first time. \u201cThe assembly makes decisions that affect the lives of all people in Wales. Of course I\u2019ll be voting. This is important.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s most senior civil servant, Sir Jeremy Heywood, is reviewing HS2 as fears grow that the high-speed railway cannot be built within its \u00a355bn budget in its current form. Heywood, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, has been quietly investigating HS2 in an effort to cut costly elements. He is expected to report to ministers by the summer. Campaigners opposed to the project believe this could lead to less compensation for businesses and homeowners whose properties are affected by construction. HS2, which would speed commuters from London to Birmingham and on to Leeds and Manchester, is designed to alleviate the capacity crisis on the railways, which are struggling to cope with the highest number of passengers since the 1920s. The economic benefits of getting business travellers between major cities quickly have been estimated at more than \u00a340bn. The boost will come in the form of new jobs, homes and businesses, according to accountancy firm EY. But the project has been plagued by cost problems since it was first mooted under the last Labour government. There was an increase of nearly \u00a310bn in 2013 and recently a \u00a35bn increase to reflect inflation. Officials and ministers are increasingly concerned that the budget could still be exceeded, even though links to the Channel Tunnel rail link (HS1) and Heathrow airport have previously been removed to cut costs. Heywood has been undertaking the review as part of work led by the government\u2019s newly formed Infrastructure and Projects Authority. A source close to HS2 said: \u201cFrom what I understand, Sir Jeremy doesn\u2019t give a stuff about the timetable, it\u2019s about costs and what we can cut out to make it cheaper.\u201d A senior rail source said: \u201cThe review started about mid-March. There are things that can be cut, like engineering work north of Birmingham that becomes redundant when a link to Crewe is built in 2027. Heywood was concerned about the budget estimates and if they can cut any costs it will give them confidence of being within those estimates.\u201d Joe Rukin, campaign manager at Stop HS2, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen links to Heathrow and HS1 lopped off in a futile attempt to keep the cost of HS2 down, but it keeps spiralling out of control. \u201cThe idea that government is looking to see what they can slice off to stop cost escalation is very disturbing to communities and environmentalists, as the very first thing to go will be the already inadequate proposed mitigations, and the only other thing they can do is reduce the already woeful access to compensation. \u201cBut even if government did that, it would not stop the cost skyrocketing as this project is simply out of control.\u201d Heywood\u2019s review has been one of the causes of a second delay to another piece of Cabinet Office work, review point one [RP1], which will evaluate whether the 1,300-person team behind the project, HS2 Ltd, is fit to manage it. RP1 was supposed to take place in autumn but was postponed because of concerns HS2 Ltd would fail certain tests. The process was then pushed back to March, but it is understood the four-person RP1 team has still not been told when to start work. A HS2 source claimed that delays were partly down to \u201ca learning curve on both sides [HS2 and Cabinet Office]\u201d, given the unique nature of the project. Rail industry insiders also said that the parliamentary bill to give the go-ahead to the first phase of HS2 might struggle to gain royal assent by the end of the year as planned. The bill is currently in the House of Lords. A government spokeswoman said: \u201cAs is normal for large projects, the Infrastructure and Projects Authority is conducting assurance of the HS2 programme as it proceeds into its delivery phase. It is standard practice for this to include a small cross government team.\u201d An HS2 spokesman said: \u201cRP1 is a standard project gateway. There are no delays to the programme and we remain on target to progress a further round of major contract invitations this summer.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Can D\u00fcndar appears in good spirits for a man facing espionage charges and a possible life sentence. The editor of Cumhuriyet, one of the last remaining bastions of media opposition to Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, had appeared in court that morning over a documentary he produced on government corruption. It is one of two cases against him \u2013 in February, he was released from prison pending a spying trial over a story on arms shipments to Syria. \u201cTurkey has never been a paradise for journalists but of course not a hell like this,\u201d he said in an interview in his office. \u201cNowadays being a journalist is much more dangerous than ever and needs courage and self-confidence. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of witch-hunt ... like McCarthyism in the US in the 1950s.\u201d Turkish journalists say local media outlets are facing one of the worst crackdowns on press freedoms since military rule in the 1980s. Prosecutors have opened close to 2,000 cases of insults to the president since Erdo\u011fan took office in 2014, prominent journalists appear in court two or three times a week, Kurdish journalists are beaten or detained in the country\u2019s restive south-east and foreign journalists have been harassed or deported. Turkey ranks 151st among 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders. D\u00fcndar was arrested in November with Cumhuriyet\u2019s Ankara bureau chief, Erdem G\u00fcl, charged with espionage and divulging state secrets and held in jail. The arms shipment story, published six months earlier, had alleged the Turkish intelligence service, M\u0130T, was sending weapons to rebels fighting Bashar al-Assad in Syria under the guise of humanitarian aid. Academics are also standing trial, accused of spreading propaganda by the separatist and outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK). The result is a climate of fear and intimidation that Turkish journalists say is an attempt at silencing the critical press. \u201cShort of journalists being assassinated, we have every kind of problem,\u201d said \u00d6zg\u00fcr \u00d6\u011fret, a freelance reporter and the representative of the Committee to Protect Journalists in the country. Some journalists have been killed. Kadri Ba\u011fdu, a journalist with a pro-Kurdish daily that had received numerous threats over its coverage, was killed by unidentified gunmen in October 2014. Syrian media activists and journalists have been killed in Turkey by Islamic State operatives. Erdo\u011fan remains as popular and powerful as ever \u2013 his Islamist AK party won an absolute majority in recent parliamentary elections, albeit in a deeply polarised country where a Kurdish insurgency rages in the south-east and Isis strikes in Ankara and Istanbul. \u201cThe only things that unite us in this country are cats and football,\u201d said \u00d6\u011fret. \u201c[But] if you kick a cat, you will be beaten up by a Kemalist, an Islamist or a socialist.\u201d Journalists and experts say the attacks on press freedom in Turkey are a sign of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s intolerance of criticism and a symptom of a broader power struggle between the president and supporters of his former ally Fethullah G\u00fclen, a preacher who now lives in exile in Pennsylvania. Erdo\u011fan believes G\u00fclenists in the judiciary and police constituted a \u201cparallel state\u201d that sought to overthrow him. G\u00fclen\u2019s acolytes in the Turkish judiciary helped remove hundreds of members of thesecular military establishment, but then friends turned on each other. News of a major corruption investigation into Erdo\u011fan\u2019s inner circle emerged in 2013, supposedly leaked by the G\u00fclenists, creating a scandal that forced the resignations of government officials and furious accusations of an attempted coup. It may well have been. Even opponents of Erdo\u011fan say the G\u00fclenists may have thought they were powerful enough to topple the government. Or it may have been that all other rivals had been eliminated and the G\u00fclen-Erdo\u011fan alliance had run its course. Whatever the cause, G\u00fclen\u2019s group, Hizmet, quickly fell out of favour. Media companies linked to it were accused of funding and supporting terrorism, and government-appointed trustees took over the two main pro-G\u00fclen media conglomerates \u2013 Koza \u0130pek Holding and Feza, the parent company of Zaman newspaper. Zaman, once one of the largest circulation newspapers in Turkey, is now a resolutely pro-government title, its new executors unconcerned about keeping up a facade of impartiality. Most of the paper\u2019s well-known writers and editors have gone into exile. Those that remain struggle. Levent Kenez, a former Zaman journalist who is editor of the pro-G\u00fclen newspaper Meydan, said his newspaper\u2019s circulation dropped from 100,000 to about 40,000 after the distribution company was taken over by the government and decided to no longer circulate it. Advertisers, which Kenez says are under pressure from the government, have also cut ties with the newspaper. \u201cI wake up every day thinking thank God they haven\u2019t yet taken over our newspaper, and every night it is thank God, we published today,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is our psychology.\u201d The state now controls most of the prominent media outlets in Turkey. \u201cErdo\u011fan wants to be a sultan, not just for Turkey but the whole region, so he wants to stop any kind of criticism,\u201d said D\u00fcndar. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a political struggle of course, to stop every critical point of view. It\u2019s not only in the press but TV, artists, academics. He hates criticism and this is the result of it, that Turkish prisons are full.\u201d Journalists with pro-government outlets deny an attack on press freedom. They acknowledge the aftermath of the takeovers was handled poorly and embarrassing to Turkey, but say journalists with links to the G\u00fclenist movement were not real journalists, rather puppets of a shadowy cult determined to overthrow the government. They insist the opposition press is vibrant, pointing to S\u00f6zc\u00fc, a widely read tabloid that mocks the president, and say anti-Erdo\u011fan columns form the majority of online commentary in the country. \u201cThe G\u00fclenists wanted to take over everything and organised conspiracies in order to reach their goal,\u201d said Ibrahim Altay, the ombudsman of the Daily Sabah, a pro-AK party newspaper. \u201cThey established a hidden government that members of the G\u00fclenist organisation were taking orders from. That\u2019s not acceptable under any circumstances. I want my secular state.\u201d Meryem Atlas, the paper\u2019s opinion editor, acknowledged that there was still much work to be done to make Turkey more democratic and transparent, but said the international press was exaggerating Turkey\u2019s problem and the media environment was a lot more free and critical than in the days of military rule, when all newspapers had to toe the junta\u2019s line. Opposition journalists in Turkey say the political battle with the G\u00fclenists has been used as a convenient club to shut down dissent among those with no links to them. D\u00fcndar, a staunch secularist, was initially accused of colluding with Hizmet in the arms shipment story for which he faces a life sentence if convicted. (An attempt to join D\u00fcndar\u2019s case to that of the broader alleged G\u00fclenist conspiracy was last month dismissed by a judge, but he still faces charges of espionage and divulging state secrets.) D\u00fcndar has pledged to continue the fight, though he has many more court appearances ahead. \u201cIf you\u2019re a journalist in Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Turkey, you have to be either a prisoner or a suspect or jobless,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the future there will be a Turkish exile press.\u201d Insulting the president Turkey\u2019s justice minister said in March during a parliamentary session that his ministry had allowed 1,845 cases of insulting the president to be prosecution since he began his tenure in 2014. Under Turkish law, prosecutions for the offence can go ahead if permission is granted by the ministry. Critics say the proliferation of these cases is a sign of a broader crackdown on dissent. Article 299 of the penal code sets a prison term of more than four years if the insult is published in the press, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and those prosecuted include journalists, activists, academics and artists. \u201cSuch cases, even when they do not result in imprisonment, take a toll on journalists,\u201d the CPJ said. \u201cConstantly appearing in court and defending the right to report or express an opinion amounts to obstruction of professional activities.\u201d Last month Erdo\u011fan\u2019s lawyer even requested the prosecution in Germany of Jan B\u00f6hmermann, a German comedian who read out a poem alleged to have denigrated the Turkish president. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, accepted the request, saying it was up to the courts to decide the limits of freedom of expression. \u201cFreedom of the press should never negate the respect for human dignity and freedom of the press can only survive and thrive with respect to human dignity,\u201d Turkey\u2019s prime minister, Ahmet Davuto\u011flu, said at a press briefing in Gaziantep last week. \u201cVery heavy insults against the president of a country that one should not really hear or read about, is that really part of the freedom of the press?\u201d Many journalists in Turkey have criticised the EU for failing to speak up about issues of freedom of expression. Brussels has been accused of even going so far as to delay and water down an annual report on human rights in Turkey so as not to jeopardise Ankara-Brussels talks about relocating refugees and migrants. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s supporters point to a rise in rightwing politics and Islamophobia in Europe as evidence of Europe\u2019s hypocrisy when it comes to freedom of speech issues in Turkey.",

They insist the opposition press is vibrant, pointing to S\u00f6zc\u00fc, a widely read tabloid that mocks the president, and say anti-Erdo\u011fan columns form the majority of online commentary in the country.</p> <p>\u201cThe G\u00fclenists wanted to take over everything and organised conspiracies in order to reach their goal,\u201d said Ibrahim Altay, the ombudsman of the Daily Sabah, a pro-AK party newspaper. \u201cThey established a hidden government that members of the G\u00fclenist organisation were taking orders from. That\u2019s not acceptable under any circumstances. I want my secular state.\u201d</p> <p>Meryem Atlas, the paper\u2019s opinion editor, acknowledged that there was still much work to be done to make Turkey more democratic and transparent, but said the international press was exaggerating Turkey\u2019s problem and the media environment was a lot more free and critical than in the days of military rule, when all newspapers had to toe the junta\u2019s line.</p> <p>Opposition journalists in Turkey say the political battle with the G\u00fclenists has been used as a convenient club to shut down dissent among those with no links to them. D\u00fcndar, a staunch secularist, was initially accused of colluding with Hizmet in the arms shipment story for which he faces a life sentence if convicted. (An attempt to join D\u00fcndar\u2019s case to that of the broader alleged G\u00fclenist conspiracy was last month dismissed by a judge, but he still faces charges of espionage and divulging state secrets.)</p> <p>D\u00fcndar has pledged to continue the fight, though he has many more court appearances ahead. \u201cIf you\u2019re a journalist in Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Turkey, you have to be either a prisoner or a suspect or jobless,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the future there will be a Turkish exile press.\u201d</p> <h2>Insulting the president</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c40e4b4068aed58794ef49484ea605f0e812a2fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c40e4b4068aed58794ef49484ea605f0e812a2fc/344_38_5662_3397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"German chancellor Angela Merkel listens to Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan at a press conference in Berlin last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">German chancellor Angela Merkel listens to Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan at a press conference in Berlin last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Axel Schmidt/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Turkey\u2019s justice minister said in March during a parliamentary session that his ministry had allowed 1,845 cases of insulting the president to be prosecution since he began his tenure in 2014.

      "bodyText": "Microsoft and Google, two of the world\u2019s greatest monopolies, have been bitter rivals for nearly 20 years. But suddenly, in late April, they announced a startling accord. The companies have withdrawn all regulatory complaints against one another, globally. Rather than fighting their battles in public courts and commissions, they have agreed to privately negotiate. This is a gentleman\u2019s agreement. The specifics are secret, but the message on both sides is that the deal reflects a change in management philosophy. Microsoft\u2019s new chief, Satya Nadella, is eager to push the vision of a dynamic, collaborative Microsoft, partnering with everyone from Apple to Salesforce. The most dramatic of these partners is Google, a company that has long been considered Microsoft\u2019s great arch-rival. The wind started to change in September, just after Sundar Pichai became Google\u2019s chief executive, when the two companies agreed to stop feuding over patents \u2013 a first step toward the current agreement. The common corporate line is that the companies want to compete on products, not court cases. But this public relations gambit masks two far more interesting tales. One is about Microsoft and its desperate chase for relevance. The other is about Google, money and power. Both are part of a broader, deeply worrying narrative \u2013 a story about how tech companies are busy redrawing the lines around our lives, and facing little resistance in doing so. Waste and fury Nobody ever wants to start a legal fight. Fractious, painful and wasteful, they divert huge resources, often for little productive gain. But this in itself fails to explain Microsoft\u2019s decision to drop pending regulatory complaints against Google in Europe, Brazil and Argentina, as well as to cease funding and participating in lobby groups that it has backed for eight years, such as FairSearch.org and ICOMP, the Initiative for a Competitive Online Marketplace. So what does explain it? It could be seen as a pragmatic move. Microsoft\u2019s profits still exceed Google\u2019s, but the ratio has been in decline for a decade. Meanwhile, since 2012, Apple has outstripped both companies combined (even if recent figures suggest this momentum might be slowing). A suite of regulatory enquiries into Google\u2019s alleged abuses of its monopoly will continue even in Microsoft\u2019s absence \u2013 both in places where Microsoft has filed complaints (Europe, Brazil, Argentina) and in others where it hasn\u2019t, such as India. With Microsoft\u2019s withdrawal, it is clear that the remaining complainants in these fights \u2013 generally small, niche internet businesses \u2013 are legitimate critics in their own right. But then again, it takes serious coordination and resources to sustain and succeed in antitrust fights. Winning, especially in a broad and generally impactful manner, is a much taller order without a deep-pocketed supporter such as Microsoft. New Microsoft But there\u2019s another possible, rather more cunning, motive. Microsoft today is facing a very different business ecosystem to the one it dominated in the 1990s. It needs to adapt. And it appears to want to do so by positioning itself at the heart of what Satya Nadella describes as \u201csystems of intelligence\u201d. Explaining this concept at Hannover Messe 2016, Nadella defined systems of intelligence as cloud-enabled digital feedback loops. They rely on the continuous flow of data from people, places and things, connected to a web of activity. And they promise unprecedented power to reason, predict and gain insight. This is unbridled Big Data utopianism. And it is a vision that brings Microsoft squarely into Google territory. So maybe Microsoft is pulling out of regulatory battles because it doesn\u2019t want to shoot itself in the foot. For emeritus Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff, this gets to the core of the Google-Microsoft deal. Zuboff is a leading critic of what she calls \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d, the monetization of free behavioral data acquired through surveillance and sold on to entities with an interest in your future behavior. As she explained to the Guardian: \u201cGoogle discovered surveillance capitalism. Microsoft has been late to this game, but it has now waded in. Viewed in this way, its agreement with Google is predictable and rational.\u201d And here the most sinister upshot of Microsoft\u2019s decision to stop needling Google with legal disputes becomes clear. \u201cA key theme I write about is that surveillance capitalism has thrived in lawless space,\u201d says Zuboff. \u201cRegulations and laws are its enemy. Democratic oversight is a threat. Lawlessness is so vital to the surveillance capitalism project,\u201d she continues, \u201cthat Google and Microsoft\u2019s shared interest in freedom from regulation outweighs any narrower competitive interests they might have or once thought they had. They can\u2019t insist to the public that they must remain unregulated, while trying to impose regulations on one another.\u201d Standing up to power What does all this mean for the cases pending against Google? For Maurice Stucke and Allen Grunes, American antitrust experts and co-authors of a comprehensive new book examining the deep and reaching implications of platform and data monopolies, Zuboff\u2019s warning of a lawless alliance among tech giants such as Microsoft and Google only accentuates the demand for rigorous, intellectually led regulatory action. And when it comes to Google, the case for action is in their view clear. \u201cThe one thing that any antitrust regime absolutely has to do, if it is to be effective, is to stand up to the most powerful companies of the time,\u201d explains Grunes. \u201cTake that away and antitrust ceases to be meaningful. \u201cThe antitrust authorities in the US and EU did that in the case of Microsoft. It required brains, resources and relentless pursuit and commitment.\u201d Yet only the Europeans, he argues, seem to have the intellectual leadership to be doing it in the case of Google. \u201cThe failure of the FTC to take meaningful action against Google is without question one of the great failures of all time.\u201d Microsoft and Google\u2019s new deal to stop fighting each other is an interesting, strategic corporate move. But it is a move accompanied by a much stronger, deeper play: to collect and capitalize data \u2013 including data about us, our behaviors, and our interactions. The challenge for regulators and citizens is complex but essential \u2013 and has only just begun.",

      "bodyText": "Hands up who knows what a subordinating conjunction is? I\u2019m a journalist and I had no idea what one was, nor have I ever needed to. My seven-year-old son and daughter, however, were expected to explain what one is as part of their homework recently. This is where education is, these days \u2013 by my reckoning, pretty much where it was in the 1950s \u2013 and I\u2019m not alone in fearing it\u2019s going to get even worse. That is why I am taking my children out of school on Tuesday, along with many others. It\u2019s not a decision any parent would take lightly, especially one who strongly believes in the importance of learning (and spends five mornings a week hurrying their children into school). But it\u2019s an act of protest against a government agenda that\u2019s putting undue pressure on children, subjecting them to a narrow, joyless curriculum, shutting out parents\u2019 democratic rights and, ultimately, forcing every school to become an academy, effectively putting all of state education into private, democratically unaccountable hands \u2013 or rather, pockets. If Nicky Morgan\u2019s white paper goes through, all this will come to pass, with no democratic mandate to speak of \u2013 it wasn\u2019t in the Conservative election manifesto. \u201cI\u2019ve never yet been on a doorstep where education has come up as an issue,\u201d Morgan said last month. If nothing else, she\u2019s succeeded in making it one. Teachers are already horrified at what\u2019s happening, and are fighting their own battle, when they\u2019re not too exhausted from jumping through the government\u2019s bureaucratic hoops. Most of them are doing their best to shoehorn in the stuff that actually interests and engages children, around the subordinating conjunctions and the rest of the crashingly dull curriculum. Kids are stressed out by the amount of hoop-jumping they\u2019ve got to do too. In a fortnight, like every year 2 pupil in England, my seven-year-olds will do their standard assessment tests, or Sats \u2013 a week of exams prioritising things like grammar, spelling, punctuation and handwriting. Which means matters as trivial as the size of a letter s could define them as academic successes or failures at an age when children in more enlightened countries have barely started school. On top of that, my 11-year-old daughter will be sitting her year 6 Sats, which have been made more difficult this year (you thought subordinating conjunctions were bad, try \u201cfronted adverbials\u201d). She\u2019s coming off the other end of the testing treadmill that primary education has become. Literacy and numeracy are all that counts. If your child excels at art or music or dance or science or poetry or geography or history or critiquing retrograde educational dogma \u2013 tough. Doesn\u2019t count. If there\u2019s any evidence that any of this is a sound approach to education, I\u2019ve yet to see it. Why shouldn\u2019t parents make themselves heard too? We\u2019re the ones whose children are being affected. We\u2019re also the ones compliantly subjecting them to it. We\u2019re also the ones paying for a significant proportion of the education system that we\u2019re against. We\u2019re the largest contingent in the entire education system, and yet we\u2019ve felt powerless to do anything. We will not be subordinated, like conjunctions! Last Saturday, I went to the launch of Parents Defending Education in London \u2013 the name speaks for itself. \u201cOur schools don\u2019t belong to the government,\u201d their launch statement reads. \u201cThey belong to our children, to the community, to the parents, to the teachers and support staff and to future generations.\u201d Michael Rosen persuasively joined the dots of the government\u2019s broad agenda, and others who\u2019d been through forced academisation shared their horror stories. That was the first time I heard about the proposed \u201cboycott\u201d or \u201cpupils\u2019 strike\u201d on Tuesday, inaugurated by the equally self-explanatory parent group, Let Our Kids Be Kids. Few Londoners seem to be aware of the campaign (though I\u2019m told it has more support in the north and west of England). Nobody in my school was. When I met the headteacher to discuss it, I was expecting a frosty response. It was more a gasp of relief. Teachers and schools need parents to stand alongside them. Parents can say and do things they can\u2019t. At a school parents\u2019 meeting the following night, the response was overwhelmingly positive. Dozens of us are taking our children out of school. We\u2019re planning on getting together in the park for a day of \u201cfun learning\u201d \u2013 painting, bug hunting, that sort of thing. Understandably, many parents are unable to do so as they\u2019re working. Others, ironically, felt that taking their children out of school would detract from their preparations for their Sats. A few felt it would be \u201cpoliticising\u201d their kids. But virtually all parents not taking part in the boycott still pledged to sign letters of support for the action. We\u2019re all in this together. Incidentally, the definition of a \u201csubordinating conjunction\u201d, if you\u2019re wondering, is a conjunction (that is \u201ca part of speech that connects words, sentences, phrases, or clauses\u201d) that \u201cconnects an independent clause and a dependent clause, and also introduces adverb clauses.\u201d Any seven-year-old could tell you that. For example: I\u2019m taking my children out of school for one day so that they get a better academic future than the one Nicky Morgan is mapping out for them.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Can a performance go viral? Ben Platt\u2019s should. As the title character in Dear Evan Hansen, the new musical from Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, he offers acting so precise yet so painfully lucid that it should overwhelm the operating systems by which most contemporary musicals operate. Platt\u2019s gestures, his expressions, his phrasing, even his vocal range \u2013 which is impressive but tends to thin out toward the top notes \u2013 all combine to communicate the fretfulness, uncertainty and timorous goodness that define his character. He plays Evan, a friendless high school senior terrified of life, the universe, everything. Speaking up scares him so much that he would rather go hungry than exchange chitchat with a pizza deliveryman. His harried single mother, Heidi, (Rachel Bay Jones) tells him, \u201cYou can\u2019t succeed if you never try.\u201d Evan nods, but you can that he believes more strongly in the corollary: \u201cIf you don\u2019t try, you can\u2019t fail.\u201d A therapist has instructed him to write pep-talk letters to himself. On the first day of school, one of them falls into the hands of Connor Murphy (Mike Faist), another outcast with drug problems and a look a peer describes as \u201cschool shooter chic\u201d. When Connor kills himself, his parents find the letter and mistakenly believe that Evan was a friend to their son. At first this attention panics Evan, but he soon accepts the role and even briefly becomes an internet sensation. Often he is tempted to tell Connor\u2019s family the truth, but he fears disappointing them and sacrificing his newfound confidence. Watching Dear Evan Hansen, one often thinks of Next to Normal, another Second Stage show about a mentally distressed protagonist (it was bipolar disorder there, anxiety disorder here). The shows share a director, Michael Greif, and a similarly slick design. But with its tuneful pop score and teenage protagonist, Dear Evan Hansen is a gentler affair, even as it takes occasional pains not to oversentimentalize the material. When Evan presents a surprisingly rosy picture of her brother, his sister Zoe (Laura Dreyfuss) sings, \u201cDon\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t true/ That you were not the monster/ That I knew.\u201d Yes, the emotional core can still turn occasionally gooey, and the critiques of internet culture, courtesy of Steven Levenson\u2019s mostly shrewd and clever book, are not exactly subtle, especially as realized in Peter Nigrini\u2019s projection design. But it\u2019s impossible not to care deeply for these characters, Platt\u2019s Evan most of all. Near the play\u2019s end, Platt positively glistens with sweat and spit and tears. Yet one never has the sense of an actor deliberately winding himself up to deliver a visceral performance. There\u2019s obvious care taken in the way he offers Evan\u2019s cringing smile, his swallowed laugh, his habit of pulling at his clothes as though searching for someone to hold onto. But all of these details feel lived, organic, unrehearsed. And Platt\u2019s ability to convey emotion through song is simply superb and often deeply heartrending. A Facebook like is the least the man deserves.",

      "body": "<p>Can a performance go viral? Ben Platt\u2019s should. As the title character in Dear Evan Hansen, the new musical from Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, he offers acting so precise yet so painfully lucid that it should overwhelm the operating systems by which most contemporary musicals operate. <br /></p> <p>Platt\u2019s gestures, his expressions, his phrasing, even his vocal range \u2013 which is impressive but tends to thin out toward the top notes \u2013 all combine to communicate the fretfulness, uncertainty and timorous goodness that define his character.</p> <p> He plays Evan, a friendless high school senior terrified of life, the universe, everything. Speaking up scares him so much that he would rather go hungry than exchange chitchat with a pizza deliveryman. His harried single mother, Heidi, (Rachel Bay Jones) tells him, \u201cYou can\u2019t succeed if you never try.\u201d Evan nods, but you can that he believes more strongly in the corollary: \u201cIf you don\u2019t try, you can\u2019t fail.\u201d</p> <p> A therapist has instructed him to write pep-talk letters to himself. On the first day of school, one of them falls into the hands of Connor Murphy (Mike Faist), another outcast with drug problems and a look a peer describes as \u201cschool shooter chic\u201d. When Connor kills himself, his parents find the letter and mistakenly believe that Evan was a friend to their son. At first this attention panics Evan, but he soon accepts the role and even briefly becomes an internet sensation. Often he is tempted to tell Connor\u2019s family the truth, but he fears disappointing them and sacrificing his newfound confidence. </p> <p> Watching Dear Evan Hansen, one often thinks of Next to Normal, another Second Stage show about a mentally distressed protagonist (it was bipolar disorder there, anxiety disorder here). The shows share a director, Michael Greif, and a similarly slick design. But with its tuneful pop score and teenage protagonist, Dear Evan Hansen is a gentler affair, even as it takes occasional pains not to oversentimentalize the material. When Evan presents a surprisingly rosy picture of her brother, his sister Zoe (Laura Dreyfuss) sings, \u201cDon\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t true/ That you were not the monster/ That I knew.\u201d</p> <p> Yes, the emotional core can still turn occasionally gooey, and the critiques of internet culture, courtesy of Steven Levenson\u2019s mostly shrewd and clever book, are not exactly subtle, especially as realized in Peter Nigrini\u2019s projection design. But it\u2019s impossible not to care deeply for these characters, Platt\u2019s Evan most of all. </p> <p>Near the play\u2019s end, Platt positively glistens with sweat and spit and tears. Yet one never has the sense of an actor deliberately winding himself up to deliver a visceral performance. There\u2019s obvious care taken in the way he offers Evan\u2019s cringing smile, his swallowed laugh, his habit of pulling at his clothes as though searching for someone to hold onto. But all of these details feel lived, organic, unrehearsed. And Platt\u2019s ability to convey emotion through song is simply superb and often deeply heartrending. A Facebook like is the least the man deserves.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "June Jolly, who has died aged 87, was a pioneering paediatric nurse who did much to improve the social and emotional care of children in hospital. She was full of ideas to lighten a child\u2019s experience of being in hospital: brightly coloured aprons (\u201cJolly tops\u201d) with big toy pockets instead of starchy uniforms for children\u2019s nurses; games invented that children confined in traction could play; rag dolls handed out as pretend patients so that children could understand what their treatment would involve; she even once brought circus animals to the ward. Toys and cuddles were part of serious work, directed towards meeting children\u2019s emotional as well as their physical needs \u2013 especially their need to have parents or other attachment figures with them on the wards. Jolly\u2019s practice, at St Thomas\u2019 hospital, in central London, and at the Brook General hospital in Woolwich, south-east London, drew on the work of social scientists, including her mentors James and Joyce Robertson, whose documentaries had revealed the damaging effect on children of being separated from their parents while in hospital. In 1981 she published The Other Side of Paediatrics: a guide to the everyday care of sick children. Jolly was born in Hove, East Sussex, the eldest of four children, to Flora (nee Leaver) and Arthur, a chartered accountant. Her family life and education were interrupted by evacuation to Canada during the second world war; at the age of 12, she found herself in charge of her nine-year-old sister and six-year-old brother through a long and terrifying journey that ended with each child being sent to a different foster family. Those separations must have had some bearing on her future career, but so too did her foster father, a paediatrician whom June followed, Saturday after Saturday, from houses to hospital and even to the morgue. Back in the UK, Jolly struggled to catch up academically, her dreams of becoming a doctor stymied by her lack of Latin. Instead she studied social science at Southampton University, completing her degree in 1950 with a third year at the London School of Economics, where, following passage of the Children Act 1948, a Home Office-backed course specialising in childcare had been established. Her tutors there included Donald Winnicott. Jolly then worked for 11 years as a social worker in child protection in Kent, before deciding that nurses were more useful than social workers and joining the first graduate nurse training course at St Thomas\u2019. But her previous experience pointed the way forward. \u201cIt was my social work understanding of children\u2019s emotional needs ... that started me looking at the emotional care of children in hospital,\u201d she said. By the time Jolly became a student nurse, in 1963, she was a mature woman and an experienced professional, confident enough to challenge rigid nursing systems. And challenge them she did, starting at the ward door, where arriving children \u2013 even infants \u2013 had to say goodbye to their mothers and go with a uniformed nurse they had never met before into a huge, strange room. Once there, their familiar clothes were replaced with strange garments, and they were left alone in barred cots. \u201cIt was a really desperate matter,\u201d Jolly said. \u201cSome children never recovered from that sort of experience.\u201d Jolly\u2019s practical nursing on the wards was limited by a serious spinal condition and several operations, but nevertheless she quickly rose to become sister-in-charge of the children\u2019s ward at St Thomas\u2019. She also worked on pain control and terminal care at St Christopher\u2019s hospice in south London and, in 1971, moved to the Brook in Woolwich, where she was involved in setting up a new paediatric unit. At each place she worked, she fought to convince the medical professionals \u2013 nursing staff, paediatricians, surgeons, anaesthetists and matrons \u2013 that for children, having mothers or \u201cward grannies\u201d with them was as important as medicine; that play mattered as much as cleanliness; and that listening to children\u2019s feelings and helping them understand what was being done to them was as crucial as doing it. Fifty years after Jolly became a nurse, her success is reflected in the first Infant Mental Health Awareness Week, which will take place in June. In 1974, Jolly was awarded a Nightingale and Rayne Foundation scholarship to study family participation in children\u2019s hospital care in North America, Canada and Jamaica. The journey and the resulting book, The Other Side of Paediatrics, raised her professional profile. She worked for the Department of Health and for the then Greenwich Health Authority and served on national committees including the Standing Nursing and Midwifery Advisory Committee. She is survived by her siblings, Gillian, Richard and Mary, and by nine nieces and nephews. \u2022 June Jolly, paediatric nurse, born 28 September 1928; died 12 March 2016",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In my memory box I have a fine collection of rejection letters from editors and agents unimpressed with my first attempt at a book. Unsurprisingly, these mementoes of failure are the odd ones out in a collection that generally catalogues the highs rather than the lows of my life. We do not generally keep pictures of ex-partners from disastrous relationships on our mantelpieces, or photos of our sullen selves trapped inside a rain-swept, half-built motel. But according to Princeton psychology professor Johannes Haushofer, we should do more to remember our failures. He has tweeted a CV of his setbacks, including lists of degree programmes he did not get into; papers that were rejected by journals; and academic positions, research funding and fellowships he did not get. Ironically, this little stunt has been a huge hit. \u201cThis darn CV of Failures has received way more attention that my entire body of academic work,\u201d he said. Expect a TED talk and book to follow. But the irony runs deeper. Haushofer probably would not have paraded his failures in the first place if he were not now a high-flying Princeton professor. Admitting to past defeats is easy if ultimately you have emerged the victor. Haushofer\u2019s confession has been praised as a breath of fresh air, a brave display of honesty. But sharing our past trials and tribulations is mainstream, not radical. No success story is complete without the chapter about overcoming adversity. Indeed, I often suspect that many people exaggerate their earlier problems in order to fit this standard narrative and if they don\u2019t, others will do it for them. JK Rowling was a single mother on benefits, but others talked this up into a \u201crags to riches\u201d fairy story. She has explicitly denied that she ever wrote in cafes to escape from an unheated flat, a story that never made much sense, given the price of a cappuccino in Edinburgh. It is much harder to, if not celebrate, at least embrace failures when they are more than temporary setbacks. Would Hausfhofer have shared his list of rejections had they not been followed by acceptances? If so, he is braver and more honest than most. Increasingly our culture peddles the myth that with enough belief, determination, and perhaps even hard work, you can achieve anything you want. So if you do terminally fail, that can only mean that you have not tried, believed, or worked enough. This is pernicious nonsense. The harder truth to accept is that success is never guaranteed. Luck plays its part, but there is also the simple fact that we do not know what we can achieve until we try. Success requires a happy coincidence of talent, effort and fortune, so if you try to do anything of any ambition, the possibility of failure is ever present. When our plans fail, there is no reason to think that necessarily reveals a deep failure in ourselves. I\u2019m not sure what I was thinking when I saved all those rejection letters. At the time, I didn\u2019t know whether they would record mere setbacks or a thwarted ambition. But either way, they would have served a purpose. Had I not go on to have a writing career, they would have reminded me that I did at least try and that the reason I did not succeed was not for want of effort. That reminder would be sobering and humbling, which is why it would have been so valuable. If we are to go to our graves at peace with ourselves, we must be able to accept our disappointments and limitations as well as our successes. Since I have gone on to earn my living by writing, I could wrongly take them to be proof of how my refusal to take no for an answer ensured that my talents were eventually recognised. The more honest way to see them is as evidence of how fortunate I was that eventually someone chose to take a punt on me. In Hollywood, every failure simply serves to make the eventual success more inevitable. In real life, every past failure should be a reminder that a happy outcome was never guaranteed. Our failed relationships, terrible jobs and bad holidays reflect our characters and the reality of our lives at least as much as the good times, which often hang on a thread. Thinking more about our failures might just help us to be more grateful for the successes we enjoy and kinder to ourselves when, more often, they elude us.",

Had I not go on to have a writing career, they would have reminded me that I did at least try and that the reason I did not succeed was not for want of effort. That reminder would be sobering and humbling, which is why it would have been so valuable. If we are to go to our graves at peace with ourselves, we must be able to accept our disappointments and limitations as well as our successes.</p> <p>Since I have gone on to earn my living by writing, I could wrongly take them to be proof of how my refusal to take no for an answer ensured that my talents were eventually recognised. The more honest way to see them is as evidence of how fortunate I was that eventually someone chose to take a punt on me.</p> <p>In Hollywood, every failure simply serves to make the eventual success more inevitable. In real life, every past failure should be a reminder that a happy outcome was never guaranteed. Our failed relationships, terrible jobs and bad holidays reflect our characters and the reality of our lives at least as much as the good times, which often hang on a thread. Thinking more about our failures might just help us to be more grateful for the successes we enjoy and kinder to ourselves when, more often, they elude us.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As Veep enters its fifth triumphant series, I\u2019d like to spew forth my unfiltered admiration for Julia Louis-Dreyfus. My 90s hair-spiration as Elaine Benes in Seinfeld, she has come to mean so much more to me than that. She navigates a career in Hollywood in which she has never been the \u201cgirlfriend\u201d or the stereotypical female \u201cvoice of reason\u201d to her more prominently featured male counterparts. And now she is playing the leader of the free world, albeit a seriously inept one, it looks like there\u2019s little left for her to conquer. She is one of the few women in US television to clown and belch and discard all vanity in the name of laughs. Her performances are entirely laugh-focused, whatever it takes. Introduced into Seinfeld after the pilot, reputedly because executives felt the setup was too male-centric, she instantly became one of an ensemble, not just the token chick. The prior relationship between Elaine and Jerry is quickly dealt with so they can get on with being friends and Louis-Dreyfus can get on with being just another one of the gang, prone to the same social disgraces and troubles as her male co-stars. She specialises in playing flawed, often awful, characters whose main focus is self-advancement. In Veep, she is Selina Meyer, a venal, nasal, Palinesque horror in soft tailoring who lurches from one political disaster to the next, mismanaging all around her, yet still somehow manages to make it to the Oval Office. But somehow, she also makes her likeable. I haven\u2019t worked out the trick she pulls on screen: behaving appallingly while appearing utterly charming. She uses the combination of her diminutive physical presence and her apparent cuteness to devastating effect when she\u2019s pacing the corridors of the White House, swearing every other word and trying to martial the chaos. It\u2019s a performance I can\u2019t imagine any other actor getting quite as right, male or female. Outside of her TV roles, she plays the Hollywood game so perfectly, owning the fate of actresses who reach a certain age and the industry no longer knows what to do with them. In the Inside Amy Schumer sketch \u201cLast Fuckable Day\u201d, she teams up with Patricia Arquette and Tina Fey, who host a picnic to celebrate her last day as a \u201cbelievably fuckable woman\u201d. They toast her longevity at 55 and she looks forward to her retirement from public life, drinking melted ice-cream and ceasing to give a fig about her appearance. Again, I can\u2019t imagine many other actors agreeing to present themselves in this light for laughs. It\u2019s that taking ownership of the crappy way her industry works and her place in it that\u2019s so impressive. One of my favourite JLD moments came at the 2014 Emmys when she went up to receive her best actress in a comedy award. Halfway to the podium, she is accosted by Bryan Cranston, who proceeds to snog her passionately for several seconds. They had worked out a skit to liven up proceedings in which, earlier in the ceremony, he reminds her of the time he had appeared as her love interest in Seinfeld and she feigns ignorance. Now there\u2019s a celebrity who doesn\u2019t take herself too seriously and bothers to give an awards show audience something more exciting to watch than just another tearful acceptance speech. Can you tell I love her? I love her.",

      "bodyText": "A a 72\u2013year-old man has been pulled alive from rubble 13 days after a huge earthquake which hit Ecuador. Manuel Vasquez was found by Venezuelan rescuers in a partially collapsed building in the fishing town of Jaramij\u00f3, the Venezuelan embassy in Quito said. They were carrying out a risk inspection at the site and after hearing sounds immediately entered to find Vasquez trapped between the walls of a room. He was freed after almost two weeks without food and taken to hospital with chronic renal failure, dehydration, confusion and a problem with his urinary tract. Vasquez had also lost several toes, had necrosis in both ankles and was disoriented, the embassy added. He remains in hospital. The team that rescued Vasquez were from the Fuerza de Tarea Humanitaria Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. It was a miraculous rescue days after search teams presumed the last of the survivors had been found. The 7.8-magnitude earthquake that hit Ecuador on 16 April killed more than 650 people, with tens of thousands injured and dozens missing. There have been several strong tremors and more than 700 aftershocks since the original quake, causing panic but little additional damage. Tremors are expected to continue for several weeks. With nearly 7,000 buildings destroyed, more than 26,000 people are living in shelters. About 14,000 security personnel are keeping order in the affected areas. Ecuador\u2019s vice president, Jorge Glas, described the quake as the strongest to hit the country in years. Survivors in the quake zone have been receiving food, water and medicine from the government and scores of foreign aid workers, but the president, Rafael Correa, has acknowledged that the poor condition of roads delayed the arrival of aid to some communities. He estimated the cost of the damage at between $2bn and $3bn. Falling oil revenues have already left the country of nearly 16 million people facing near-zero growth and lower investment. Ecuador\u2019s private banking association recently said its member banks would defer payments on credit cards, loans and mortgages for clients in the quake zone for three months in order to assist reconstruction efforts.",

      "bodyText": "Dog-whistle politics are well and truly done. Zac Goldsmith\u2019s mayoral campaign is not about coded, inaudible or even subtle signals to targeted groups. It is roaringly racist and ever more desperate. Over the weekend, Goldsmith\u2019s mission to link Sadiq Khan with terrorism continued in a column that was illustrated by a picture of a bus destroyed in the 7/7 attacks, and the shock it prompted was real; real enough for some of Goldsmith\u2019s fellow Conservatives, including Sayeeda Warsi, to express their dismay. Goldsmith, a man who displays a mannered listlessness in lieu of charisma, was content for a while to be portrayed as someone who was somehow having racist tactics forced upon him. Now he seems quite happy to repeatedly suggest that Khan \u2013 though not supported by any extremist group \u2013 is close to them. His campaign has been a clumsy and embarrassing effort to target people on the basis of their presumed ethnicity, so flyers have gone out to British Indians, for instance, with Goldsmith expressing his support for the Indian prime minister Narendra Modi \u2013 an attempt to suggest, surely, that because Khan is of Pakistani descent he cannot represent them. The flyers feature some blurb about Goldsmith having spent time in Delhi and Rajasthan, doing Diwali, and condescending warnings about keeping family jewellery safe. Goldsmith has insisted he has not referenced Khan\u2019s religious or ethnic background, but what does he mean when he says of Khan: \u201cWhat he is actually doing is, I think, incredibly dangerous. He is calling Islamophobia to prevent legitimate questions being asked\u201d? Repeatedly connecting Khan with danger and terror is now Goldsmith\u2019s core message. Diffidently he talks about housing or transport, but mostly it comes to this: a repulsive campaign that links a Muslim politician \u2013 who has actually had a fatwa declared against him, and faced death threats as a result of his support for equal marriage \u2013 to fundamentalists. All of this is going on as Labour is engulfed in its own row about antisemitism. The majority of the electorate will be fairly mystified by some of this, and will want to vote, at the local elections on Thursday, for a party that looks competent and capable. People want local councillors who make sure their rubbish is collected on time, but all they will see is this ungovernable chaos, with Jeremy Corbyn at its centre. Is there antisemitism in the party? Well, of course there is. Do we need an inquiry? Why not simply listen to, er \u2026 actual Jewish people who have been warning of its rise for some time? To sweep it away as a Blairite plot or, as some of Corbyn\u2019s fellow travellers do, to quibble over its definition, is appalling. A certain section of the Labour party was exactly the environment in which Livingstone could comfortably make his vile comments. This was hardly the first time. The trite argument that antisemitism exists on the left, Islamophobia on the right, so that somehow they cancel each other out, is ridiculous. Both kinds of racism exist, and they exist throughout society. The current fracturing of party politics means they rise to the surface. Goldsmith can now frighten the voters by suggesting that somehow Khan will let Livingstone back in. Livingstone must surely be put out to pasture, to explain his obnoxious views to a dwindling audience of newts. So too should Goldsmith, no long a cipher of a dim but nice sort, but a shallow opportunist willing to stir racial tension. Public life can do without these dregs, and whatever the state of the Labour party, London is bigger and better than this and deserves so much more.",

      "bodyText": "Staff at the BBC have called for an investigation into the appointment of a new business presenter at Radio 4\u2019s Today programme following allegations the application process was unfair. The post at the BBC\u2019s morning news programme was initially opened only to internal candidates. BBC employees thought to have applied include Tanya Beckett, Adam Parsons, Joe Lynam, Jonty Bloom and Matthew Price, Today\u2019s chief correspondent. The job was ultimately given to Dominic O\u2019Connell, the business editor of the Sunday Times, prompting representatives from the National Union of Journalists to say members had \u201clost faith in the BBC\u2019s recruitment process\u201d. It is believed the job opening was opened to external candidates later in the search. A BBC spokesman said: \u201cIt was a fair and open process, which adhered to our recruitment policy.\u201d BBC-based NUJ representatives, however, wrote to the corporation\u2019s director general, Tony Hall, and its HR director, Valerie Hughes, on Friday demanding O\u2019Connell\u2019s appointment be suspended pending a full investigation. The letter stated: \u201cBBC NUJ chapels are dismayed that an external candidate has been engaged as the Today programme business presenter. This vacancy was open only to internal candidates. Many of the applicants have already done the job. \u201cThe job description says: \u2018He/she will be a skilled broadcaster with proven interviewing skills ... He or she will be a strong writer and be interested in creative radio and video production. Radio packaging skills will be an advantage.\u2019 To our knowledge, Mr O\u2019Connell has no broadcasting experience. \u201cBBC applicants were assured that it would be an open and fair process. However, Mr O\u2019Connell was seen twice in the past month in NBH, the second time to do an audition, while the internal interview process was under way. \u201cWhen the BBC applicants learned they had been unsuccessful, they were told that James Harding wanted someone who could break stories. The NUJ then made clear our belief that there are several suitable internal candidates: highly qualified, experienced, award-winning who regularly break stories, but the BBC pressed on with its invitation to Mr O\u2019Connell.\u201d In the letter, seen by the Guardian, the union reps said an external recruitment freeze has been in place at the BBC since 2014, and yet dozens of jobs have been given away \u201ceither without being advertised, or without competitive boards, or to people from outside the BBC, hand-picked by news management\u201d. They added: \u201cAs a public body, the BBC has a duty to act fairly. This includes meeting reasonable expectations that it has created for job applicants. In this case, those expectations were and are that appointments will be fair, transparent and open only to serving BBC staff. \u201cThe BBC is precluded from acting contrary to those expectations, and like all public bodies, the BBC is subject to judicial review. Our members have lost faith in the BBC\u2019s recruitment process. Some have even said they will never again apply for a job within the BBC. \u201cWe ask you to suspend the employment of Mr O\u2019Connell immediately and undertake that all BBC managers and HR officers involved in this recruitment process will clarify why none of the internal candidates was suitable for the role. We also ask you to confirm that Mr O\u2019Connell was being courted before the internal boards had completed their work.\u201d O\u2019Connell has been business editor of the Sunday Times since 2010, having joined the paper in 2001. Before that, he was part of the launch team of Sunday Business. Under his watch, the Sunday Times broke a series of big business stories, including the news of BHS\u2019s pending administration and previously the Pfizer bid for AstraZeneca. He also revealed allegations that Rolls Royce had bribed the Suharto family in Indonesia, the sale of Monarch airlines to Greybull, Anglo American\u2019s takeover of De Beers, and the ghost flights scandal at Heathrow. O\u2019Connell is set to replace Simon Jack, who was recently appointed BBC business editor. In a press release, Jasmin Buttar, the editor of the BBC\u2019s business and economics unit, said: \u201cThe business slots on the Today programme play a big role in setting the business news agenda for each day, so it is great for the BBC to have such a high-calibre, agenda-setting journalist taking on this position. \u201cDominic has exceptional contacts in the business world and a track record in original journalism that will be invaluable to Today and the BBC\u2019s business news more widely.\u201d O\u2019Connell did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Manuel Pellegrini has revealed he knew Real Madrid wanted to sack him as manager only two months after being appointed. Pellegrini, who will be replaced by Pep Guardiola as Manchester City manager in the summer, spent one season at Real in 2009\u201110 before being sacked with the 10-times European champions having finished as runners-up behind Barcelona in the La&nbsp;Liga title race. In an interview with the Spanish newspaper El Mundo before Wednesday\u2019s Champions League semi-final second leg in Madrid, the 62-year-old opened up on a range of subjects, including the revelation he knew it was always the intention of the club\u2019s president, Florentino P\u00e9rez, to dispense with his services. \u201cI knew in August I was going to be sacked because he told Villarreal\u2019s president [Fernando Roig] and he told me,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cIt\u2019s an honour to manage Madrid. What happens is when you manage Madrid, you have to have the capacity to accept the club is not just sporting, it\u2019s really political. And to that extreme, you have to let people interfere who, for me, don\u2019t have the knowledge of football to do so.\u201d Asked if he was referring to P\u00e9rez, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s not me [to name names]. If you let people interfere who don\u2019t have football knowledge, it you let yourself be weakened by the criticism that comes from the political side, the sporting side or from personal interests, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready. \u201cI had the fortune to pass one of the most difficult tests in football and it did not change me at all. I always knew that what the players most appreciated from me was to arrive on Monday and for nothing to have changed whether we had lost or won. I demanded the same from them, the same concepts, independent of what was being said on the exterior. I never played a player because I was advised by someone else, or if I received more or less criticism. Madrid has its model and it won\u2019t change.\u201d City travel to the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u knowing an away goal will significantly increase their chances of reaching their first Champions League final. Pellegrini said Madrid\u2019s defensive tactics in the first leg had surprised him but the Chilean expects Zinedine Zidane\u2019s side to adopt a different approach. \u201cI think we had an attitude of trying to win the game. We will try to do exactly the same in Madrid,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we won\u2019t go there for another goalless draw. We will try to get up, press and score, because we always want to score. I also see a more open Madrid. Nobody has scored at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u in the Champions League this season. The statistics are to be broken.\u201d However, Pellegrini dismissed a question on whether he is planning to meet Guardiola, the Bayern Munich manager, to discuss the Spaniard\u2019s move to Manchester. \u201cNo, no, I have not spoken to him about it. If I run into him, hopefully it will be in the final in Milan,\u201d he said. Asked if he wanted to avoid Bayern should City reach the final, he said: \u201cNo. I want to get there. I do not care against whom.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A Vogue cover shot is not a serious portrait. Who would expect it to be? I\u2019ve nothing against the romantic rural pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge that decorate the June issue of Vogue. Nice face, nice clothes. But is a glossy picture of Kate Middleton in any way a serious work of art? The National Portrait Gallery claims it is. This royal fashion shoot by photographer Josh Olins was jointly commissioned by Vogue and the NPG, and one of the pictures will hang in its exhibition Vogue 100: A Century of Style. The gallery\u2019s director, Nicholas Cullinan, has fawningly enthused that \u201cJosh has captured the duchess exactly as she is \u2013 full of life, with a great sense of humour, thoughtful and intelligent, and in fact, very beautiful.\u201d The NPG is apparently working hard to turn Kate Middleton into an icon of modern art. There are plenty of reasons to be a republican \u2013 the medievalism of hereditary rule, the backwardness it imposes on our political system, its perpetual undermining of democracy as an ideal \u2013 but what really gets my goat is the way the royal family makes British art stupid. Kate Middleton\u2019s relationship with the NPG is typical of the monarchy\u2019s politely poisonous effect on art. It is supposedly one of our most important public museums, but it goes gaga for royalty. It keeps commissioning royal portraits, and it keeps on pretending they are proper works of art. The duchess\u2019s Vogue shoot is, from this museum\u2019s point of view, a merciful recovery from its 2013 commission of a widely scorned painted portrait by Paul Emsley. That was mocked for being waxen and inanimate: by contrast the Vogue cover has been praised for its casual beauty. But who cares? This is all tosh. It has nothing to do with art; and in a modern Britain that prides itself on its artists, galleries and aesthetic daring, it is absurd that a public gallery lets itself be a servant of royalty. The NPG is by no means alone in letting the royals walk all over it. Every public art collection in Britain is part of the same pretence. No museum director is brave enough to state the obvious \u2013 that our great museums would be even better if the Royal Collection was given over to the nation. An astonishing wall of silence from the art elite protects this glaring, unjustifiable corruption of our artistic heritage. The home life of the Duchess and Duke of Cambridge was glimpsed recently in photographs of them receiving the US president. One of the paintings on their wall caused a controversy because it is called The Negro Page and this apparently caused anxiety among royal staff in case Barack Obama spotted it. Yet I am just as struck by the painting\u2019s preciousness as its archaic racism. It is a glowing masterpiece of landscape art by Aelbert Cuyp, one of the great artists of the 17th century Dutch golden age. And it\u2019s just hanging there in the young Windsors\u2019 front room where George and Charlotte throw toys around. It should be in the National Gallery \u2013 with a modernised title. The scope and scale of the Royal Collection is vast, and it would make a real difference to our museums. I was recently showing a group of people round the National Gallery, and someone wanted to see works by women in its collection. We looked at some of the handful of paintings by women it has, but I found myself telling the story of Artemisia Gentileschi, the brilliant follower of Caravaggio who was the most original female artist of the baroque age. Gentileschi\u2019s Self-Portrait is a masterpiece in which she depicts herself as a muscular worker in the art of painting. It would be a huge hit at the National Gallery \u2013 what a great talking point about women, art, history and power. But it languishes in the Royal Collection instead, in a gallery lost among the royalist entertainment at Hampton Court. So we come back to the duchess\u2019s Vogue shots. She is assumed to have some kind of special relationship with art because she studied art history at university. She\u2019s certainly chosen a historically important painting from the family art vault for her home. So how does this inform her \u201cportraits\u201d in Vogue? Not at all. These are just slight and silly pictures that only a flatterer would call art. Step forward, National Portrait Gallery. The Windsors treat one of the best art collections in the world as their home decor while patronising a glib, safe, lowbrow idea of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cportraiture\u201d. The art establishment plays its game gladly, staying silent about the wastefulness and indulgence of the Royal Collection and hailing Kate in a hat as the next Mona Lisa. Meanwhile the actual works of Leonardo are locked away in Windsor Castle like so many royal trinkets.",

It has nothing to do with art; and in a modern Britain that prides itself on its artists, galleries and aesthetic daring, it is absurd that a public gallery lets itself be a servant of royalty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2ff988e367b1dbbf85ab5a1e4746aa88f08ab6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2ff988e367b1dbbf85ab5a1e4746aa88f08ab6e/0_3_3128_1877/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and Michelle Obama visit Kensington Palace for dinner with Britain\u2019s Prince William, his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince Harry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The Negro Page is a glowing masterpiece of landscape art and it\u2019s just hanging there in the young Windsors\u2019 front room where George and Charlotte throw toys around.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: POOL/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The NPG is by no means alone in letting the royals walk all over it. Every public art collection in Britain is part of the same pretence. No museum director is brave enough to state the obvious \u2013 that our great museums would be even better if the <a href=\"https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection\" title=\"\">Royal Collection</a> was given over to the nation. An astonishing wall of silence from the art elite protects this glaring, unjustifiable corruption of our artistic heritage.</p> <p>The home life of the Duchess and Duke of Cambridge was glimpsed recently in photographs of them receiving the US president. One of the paintings on their wall caused a controversy because it is called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2016/apr/29/what-drew-william-kate-negro-page-painting-barack-obama\" title=\"\">The Negro Page</a> and this apparently caused anxiety among royal staff in case Barack Obama spotted it. Yet I am just as struck by the painting\u2019s preciousness as its archaic racism. It is a glowing masterpiece of landscape art by <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/aelbert-cuyp\" title=\"\">Aelbert Cuyp</a>, one of the great artists of the 17th century Dutch golden age. And it\u2019s just hanging there in the young Windsors\u2019 front room where George and Charlotte throw toys around. It should be in the National Gallery \u2013 with a modernised title.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"18fd0063427155f08f49c53326647bf8cff01271\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18fd0063427155f08f49c53326647bf8cff01271/0_0_2599_3367/772.jpg\" alt=\"Front cover of Vogue featuring the Duchess of Cambridge\" width=\"772\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018So we come back to the duchess\u2019s Vogue shots.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Olins/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The scope and scale of the Royal Collection is vast, and it would make a real difference to our museums. I was recently showing a group of people round the National Gallery, and someone wanted to see works by women in its collection. We looked at some of the handful of paintings by women it has, but I found myself telling the story of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/nov/19/cumberland-art-gallery-review-queen-hampton-court\" title=\"\">Artemisia Gentileschi</a>, the brilliant follower of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/caravaggio\" title=\"\">Caravaggio</a> who was the most original female artist of the baroque age. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/30/self-portrait-review-james-hall-tracey-emin\" title=\"\">Gentileschi\u2019s Self-Portrait</a> is a masterpiece in which she depicts herself as a muscular worker in the art of painting. It would be a huge hit at the National Gallery \u2013 what a great talking point about women, art, history and power. But it languishes in the Royal Collection instead, in a gallery lost among the royalist entertainment at Hampton Court.</p> <p>So we come back to the duchess\u2019s Vogue shots. She is assumed to have some kind of special relationship with art because she studied <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jan/09/history-of-art-a-degree-for-the-elite\" title=\"\">art history at university</a>. She\u2019s certainly chosen a historically important painting from the family art vault for her home. So how does this inform her \u201cportraits\u201d in Vogue? Not at all. These are just slight and silly pictures that only a flatterer would call art. Step forward, National Portrait Gallery. The Windsors treat one of the best art collections in the world as their home decor while patronising a glib, safe, lowbrow idea of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cportraiture\u201d.</p> <p>The art establishment plays its game gladly, staying silent about the wastefulness and indulgence of the Royal Collection and hailing Kate in a hat as the next Mona Lisa. Meanwhile the actual works of Leonardo are locked away in Windsor Castle like so many royal trinkets.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is no exaggeration to say Graeme Fowler was instrumental in laying the foundations for the career of the man who was to become one of the most successful captains the country has had and who now runs England cricket. Andrew Strauss was a multitalented sportsman, and a third-year student at Durham when Fowler set up his brainchild cricket centre of excellence there and began coaching the university\u2019s best players. \u201cHe was,\u201d said Strauss recently, \u201cthe man who turned me from a recreational cricketer to someone who believed he could play professionally.\u201d For 19 years Fowler ran his centre, latterly under the MCC banner and the blueprint for five centres at Cambridge, Oxford, Loughborough, Leeds and Cardiff. From his coaching, in which life skills played as big a part as those of the game, emerged 60 county cricketers, six of whom became captains with a half-dozen representing England. \u201cI wanted to be the sort of coach I would have liked to have had,\u201d was the plank of his philosophy. By this I think he meant someone who could spot ability and knew how to nurture it while recognising individuality. He did not overburden with theory but challenged thinking and provoked questioning. He regarded his Test match double century in the stifling heat and humidity of Chennai, and the hundred made at Lord\u2019s against the most feared fast bowling attack of all, as a more relevant qualification than any coaching certificate, although he possessed those in spades too. And from it emerged young men and women better equipped to face whatever life had in store, either in sport or not. Last year he left his job. The goalposts had been shifted by MCC, whose funding provided the facility. No longer would it be a centre of excellence, embracing the elite cricketers, but instead would become community-based, involving all teams and standards across the board. MCC, not unreasonably, believed it had a duty to try to reverse the decline in recreational participation. His centre, Fowler argued, had always been towards the furtherance of the standard of county cricket and from that the national team. It was an argument he could not win and so he left. Had Strauss gone to Durham now, he may have taken a different path. Yet being an international batsman and superb coach and mentor may not be Foxy\u2019s greatest work. It was 12 years ago when Sarah, his wife and soulmate, first picked up on his depression after weeks of non-communication with her and their three young daughters had aroused her suspicion. Reluctantly he went to the doctor, who confirmed what, intuitively, she had suspected. \u201cI feel terrible,\u201d he told the doctor. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m not interested in anything, everything is pointless. I\u2019ve no appetite.\u201d This the 59-year-old documents in the opening chapter of his riveting book, Absolutely Foxed. Then comes one of the most thought-provoking paragraphs I have read in any book of this nature. \u201cHad he thought of suicide, the doctor asked [not, Foxy explained to me in a lighter moment, a suggestion of a career path]? \u201cNo,\u201d he replied, \u201cbecause I have a nice life. I have a great job, great family, lovely wife. I know all that exists but I can\u2019t get to it. It\u2019s over there and I can\u2019t get there. So am I going to kill myself? The answer is no. But do I wish I was dead? Yes.\u201d It shattered me to read that. Our careers overlapped only right at the end of mine but I had known him much better from time with Test Match Special. He appeared to have inherited the gene of eternal youth in body and mind. Puckish might have been a word devised especially for him. We share a sense of the absurd. But, as far as I am aware, no one twigged his mental health was so precarious and here is where Foxy\u2019s greatest work may just be that in which he is currently engaged. Unbeknown to Sarah he weaned himself off medication and, understanding that his condition can be managed but not cured, devised a way of coping. This involved a sort of table of mental health, a scale of 0 to 20 on which 10 is neutral. Anything above 10 is good, and below bad: his best is 16, his lowest five. Thus he can assess and communicate his condition at any given time, and his understanding and loving family in particular can respond appropriately. Now he is engrossed in the challenge of further breaking the taboo of mental health issues among sportspeople in particular. Cricketers such as Marcus Trescothick, Michael Yardy and Jonathan Trott have been in the vanguard of bringing the topic into the public forum. Cricket can be proud to have led the way but, as Foxy recognises, it is important not just that sufferers feel they can relate their experiences, but also that others can perhaps recognise when someone may have a problem. Earlier this year he spent time travelling around all the first-class counties, on behalf of the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association, which is doing wonderful work on that side of sport,, delivering a seminar on his experiences. He has put together a checklist to help players keep a note of their mental health but thinks it is as important to provide a checklist of indicators for team-mates. It is not shameful to have mental health issues, he says. He does not claim to be an expert on mental health. \u201cIt is not me standing up as a clinician and telling them what they need to do,\u201d he says in the book. \u201cIt is simply about me sharing what happens to me and how I feel. I welcome such open discussion about depression in society.\u201d It is a discussion he continues with his book. It is an excellent read but more importantly a profoundly important thought-provoking one that deserves to be read beyond the cricket world.

    "webTitle": "Leicester players will watch Tottenham match together, says Marc Albrighton", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marc Albrighton has hailed the never-say-die attitude that has taken Leicester City to the verge of the Premier League title and left Tottenham Hotspur with no margin for error when they face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Monday night. Leicester\u2019s point at Manchester United extended their unbeaten run to 10 matches and means that Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side will be crowned champions if Spurs fail to beat Chelsea. The Leicester players are planning to watch the Spurs match together and Albrighton hopes that the draw secured at Old Trafford, courtesy of Wes Morgan\u2019s first-half equaliser, turns up the heat on Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side, who also have history against them. Spurs have not beaten Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in 28 attempts, going to back to February 1990, when Gary Lineker, of all people, scored a late winner in a 2-1 victory. \u201cMaybe it does put a little bit more pressure on [Spurs],\u201d Albrighton said after the 1-1 draw at Manchester United. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether they were expecting us to get anything, probably a point. They\u2019ve got a tough game away at Chelsea and we\u2019ll be watching that with a close eye on it. I don\u2019t think we can ignore this one. I didn\u2019t watch last week, but I think when there is a chance to win the league, like this week, we have all got to watch it. I think we will probably spend the night all together.\u201d Albrighton made a conscious decision to avoid Tottenham\u2019s game against West Bromwich Albion a week earlier, when Craig Dawson scored at both ends as the title race took another twist. \u201cI was in a restaurant in Lichfield with my fiancee, oblivious to it,\u201d the former England Under-21 international said. \u201cThe week before when they played Stoke, I watched that. I saw them roll Stoke over and that was pretty hard to take. So last Monday I said we\u2019d go out for a nice meal, and I left my phone in the car. I got back and saw the result and was delighted.\u201d Although Leicester missed out on the chance to wrap up the title at Old Trafford, there was much to be admired about the way they recovered from conceding an early goal, at a time when United were building up a head of steam, hauled themselves back into the game through Morgan\u2019s header and showed resilience and spirit to hold on for a point. \u201cWe\u2019ve got that never-say-die attitude. I think that\u2019s won us a lot of points this season,\u201d Albrighton said. \u201cEarly on this season you\u2019ve got the draws at Stoke and Southampton, we were 2-0 down in both of them, and 2-0 down in the home game against Villa [when Leicester came back to win 3-2]. So that showed our character early in the season and we\u2019ve continued to do that. We\u2019ve gone behind at Old Trafford, which is a daunting place - it\u2019s a big pitch and the fans are behind them, but credit to the lads, we carried on going, got the equaliser and held on.\u201d The one sour note for Leicester was Danny Drinkwater\u2019s second-half dismissal, which rules him out of Saturday\u2019s home match against Everton. \u201cIt is obviously going to be a massive loss for us,\u201d Albrighton said. \u201cDrinky is a great player, he\u2019s been brilliant for us this season and he\u2019ll be gutted that he won\u2019t be able to get involved on Saturday. But I am sure whoever steps in \u2013 whether it is Andy King or one of the other lads \u2013 will do a fantastic job.\u201d",

Spurs have not beaten Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in 28 attempts, going to back to February 1990, when Gary Lineker, of all people, scored a late winner in a 2-1 victory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/01/leicester-city-fans-title-spirit-wes-morgan-draw\">Leicester\u2019s fans get in the title spirit as Wes Morgan earns draw | Stuart James</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMaybe it does put a little bit more pressure on [Spurs],\u201d Albrighton said after the 1-1 draw at Manchester United. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether they were expecting us to get anything, probably a point. They\u2019ve got a tough game away at Chelsea and we\u2019ll be watching that with a close eye on it. I don\u2019t think we can ignore this one. I didn\u2019t watch last week, but I think when there is a chance to win the league, like this week, we have all got to watch it. I think we will probably spend the night all together.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/02/leicester-citys-claudio-ranieri-ill-be-last-to-know-if-spurs-lose-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4tnfb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2497241\"            data-video-name=\"Leicester City's Claudio Ranieri: I'll be last to know if Spurs lose \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"SNTV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5727180fe4b0a2f120514d43\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/02/160502RanieriReax_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/02/160502RanieriReax_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/02/160502RanieriReax_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/02/160502RanieriReax_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/02/160502RanieriReax.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/02/leicester-citys-claudio-ranieri-ill-be-last-to-know-if-spurs-lose-video\">Leicester City\u2019s Claudio Ranieri: I\u2019ll be last to know if Spurs lose</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Albrighton made a conscious decision to avoid <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/25/tottenham-hotspur-west-bromwich-albion-premier-league-match-report\">Tottenham\u2019s game against West Bromwich Albion</a> a week earlier, when Craig Dawson scored at both ends as the title race took another twist. \u201cI was in a restaurant in Lichfield with my fiancee, oblivious to it,\u201d the former England Under-21 international said. \u201cThe week before when they played Stoke, I watched that. I saw them roll Stoke over and that was pretty hard to take. So last Monday I said we\u2019d go out for a nice meal, and I left my phone in the car. I got back and saw the result and was delighted.\u201d</p> <p>Although Leicester missed out on the chance to wrap up the title at Old Trafford, there was much to be admired about the way they recovered from conceding an early goal, at a time when United were building up a head of steam, hauled themselves back into the game through Morgan\u2019s header and showed resilience and spirit to hold on for a point.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got that never-say-die attitude. I think that\u2019s won us a lot of points this season,\u201d Albrighton said. \u201cEarly on this season you\u2019ve got the draws at Stoke and Southampton, we were 2-0 down in both of them, and 2-0 down in the home game against Villa [when Leicester came back to win 3-2]. So that showed our character early in the season and we\u2019ve continued to do that. We\u2019ve gone behind at Old Trafford, which is a daunting place - it\u2019s a big pitch and the fans are behind them, but credit to the lads, we carried on going, got the equaliser and held on.\u201d</p> <p>The one sour note for Leicester was Danny Drinkwater\u2019s second-half dismissal, which rules him out of Saturday\u2019s home match against Everton. \u201cIt is obviously going to be a massive loss for us,\u201d Albrighton said. \u201cDrinky is a great player, he\u2019s been brilliant for us this season and he\u2019ll be gutted that he won\u2019t be able to get involved on Saturday. But I am sure whoever steps in \u2013 whether it is Andy King or one of the other lads \u2013 will do a fantastic job.\u201d</p>",

They think the party is the thing that is going to get them there and they must defend it.\u201d",

Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Desnard says his managerial job at the perfume company, which made him redundant 18 months ago, was so tedious he became exhausted and literally bored out of his mind. The 44-year-old said his \u201cdescent into hell\u201d was similar to a burnout, but less interesting. In what is believed to be the first case of its kind in France, Desnard is seeking \u20ac360,000 (\u00a3282,000) in compensation and damages \u2013 including holiday pay, he says, is due. French press reporting his claims have taken the unusual step of using the English term \u201cbore out\u201d to describe what Desnard, who lives in Paris, claims to have suffered. Desnard complained that between 2010 and 2014 he was mis au placard, or put in the cupboard by his then employer Interparfums, a French phrase that involves giving employees little or no work, or menial tasks. He told Agence France-Presse he was relegated to doing tasks that had nothing to do with his job and deprived of his original responsibilities. This, he alleges, left him \u201cdestroyed\u201d and with \u201cserious depression\u201d. \u201cI was ashamed of being paid for doing nothing,\u201d he said. Desnard claimed the stress and lack of stimulation at work triggered an epileptic fit when he was driving. He was signed off work for seven months before being made redundant in September 2014 for \u201cprolonged absence\u201d that had \u201cdisturbed the smooth working\u201d of the company. Jean-Philippe Benissan, Interparfums\u2019 lawyer, remarked that Desnard \u201cnever said anything about being bored\u201d during his time with the firm and alleged he had first complained of burnout. \u201cIf he had nothing to do for four years, why did the company keep him on,\u201d Benissan asked. In December 2015, a court ordered Desnard to pay his former employer \u20ac1,000 for defamation. The court judged he was \u201cinspired by a sense of personal animosity\u201d against his former employer who he had become convinced, without any real proof, had \u201cruined his health\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 May 2016 to correct the phrase \u201cmis au placard\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Giorgio Squinzi had a lot on his mind over the weekend. The Sassuolo owner\u2019s term as president of Confindustria, the Italian employers\u2019 confederation, was at an end. After four years representing the interests of some 148,000 companies \u2013 with more than five million combined employees \u2013 he needed to ensure a smooth handover to his successor. But you can be sure that he still kept a close eye on Sunday\u2019s football scores. With three games left in the Serie&nbsp;A season, Sassuolo were seventh in the table and just one point behind Milan. In the likely scenario that the Rossoneri lose the Coppa Italia final against Juventus this month, then finishing sixth would be sufficient to qualify for Europe. For Sassuolo, that would be a historic achievement. This is a club who had never even played in the top flight before their promotion in 2013. One representing a town whose entire population would fill barely half the seats at San Siro. They have Squinzi to thank for their ascent. Owner of the Mapei group, a manufacturer of building materials with a roughly \u20ac2bn annual turnover, he sponsored Sassuolo on and off during the 1980s and 1990s but in 2003 bought them outright. The club were operating in Serie C2 \u2013 then the fourth tier of Italian football \u2013 but within three years secured their first promotion. They have not looked back since. This is not the classic story of a billionaire owner throwing his financial weight around. Sassuolo\u2019s wage bill this season is roughly one quarter the size of Milan\u2019s. Their success has been built on careful planning and a sound business model, plus some savvy coaching appointments. It was Massimiliano Allegri who led the team up from Serie&nbsp;C1 to Serie&nbsp;B back in 2008, before becoming a Scudetto winner with Milan and Juventus. Sassuolo struggled for a few years to find an adequate replacement, but in 2012 appointed another young Italian manager by the name of Eusebio Di Francesco. Four years later, he is being touted as one of the sharpest footballing minds on the peninsula. There is nothing revolutionary about Di&nbsp;Francesco\u2019s approach. During a two-hour seminar at Gazzetta dello Sport\u2019s offices this year, he laid out his core tactical beliefs: arguing that 4-3-3 is an almost perfect formation \u2013 \u201cit only has one problem: you struggle to mark your opponent\u2019s playmaker\u201d. He discussed preferred movements for his forwards that were hardly complicated to grasp \u2013 \u201cTo simplify: one attacker goes wide, one attacks the front post and one attacks the second.\u201d But everything is in the execution. Di&nbsp;Francesco is known to drill certain movements in training ad nauseam, obliging his players to make the same runs over and over until they become second nature. \u201cFootball is timing plus space,\u201d he explained. \u201cRepetition is fundamental.\u201d Those methods might not sound inspiring, but the results on the pitch certainly have been. Sassuolo have beaten Juventus, Napoli and Milan this season, as well as drawing with Roma and Fiorentina. Only the top three have lost fewer games in Serie&nbsp;A. Better yet, such successes have been built on domestic talent. Sassuolo have only three foreign players in their first-team squad, and since earning promotion to the top flight have made only two signings from clubs outside Italy. Marius Alexe played six games during his one-year loan from Dinamo Bucharest, whilst Antonio Sanabria was only ever being \u201cparked\u201d at Sassuolo on his way to joining Roma. Di Francesco insists that he has no ideological opposition to acquiring players from abroad, but hints at a belief that too many of those who arrive in Serie A are no more talented than the Italians whose places they take. When Sassuolo do add a foreign footballer, they need to be the sort who can \u201cmake the difference\u201d. All three of Gregoire Defrel, Sime Vrsaljko and Alfred Duncan meet that description \u2013 the team\u2019s joint-leading goalscorer, a well-rounded full-back who starts for the Croatian national team, and a dynamic box-to-box midfielder respectively. Age is also a factor. Defrel and Vrsaljko are both 24 years old, and Duncan only 23. They have integrated seamlessly into a team who continue to boast two of Italy\u2019s most promising young forwards, even after Simone Zaza was sold to Juventus. Domenico Berardi has seven goals and five assists in 28 games from the right wing, and turned 21 in August. The 24-year-old Nicola Sansone has scored just as often from the opposite flank. The foundations are laid, in other words, for continued success. Little wonder Di&nbsp;Francesco recently chose to extend his contract through to 2019. He had previously been linked with Milan. When the Rossoneri fired Sinisa Mihajlovic, no less an authority than Arrigo Sacchi suggested Silvio Berlusconi hire Di&nbsp;Francesco as his replacement. The club named Cristian Brocchi as caretaker until the end of this season instead. The painful truth for Milan is that Di&nbsp;Francesco might not have accepted the job if it were offered. Asked at the start of April where he we has headed next in his career, the manager replied: \u201cWherever there is no confusion. And Sassuolo, from this point of view, are among the best clubs in Italy.\u201d Milan, under those same terms, must be among the very worst. From the directionless transfer policy that has seen the club veer from recycling former stars on the cheap into a much-needed but poorly executed splurge last summer, through to a divided board and endless misinformation regarding potential investors, it is easy to see why Di&nbsp;Francesco might not view them as a desirable employers. And that was before his team overtook Milan on Sunday. Sassuolo did not play well at home against last-placed Verona, mustering just six shots to the visitors\u2019 16. But another mantra of Di&nbsp;Francesco\u2019s is that his team should \u201clive off the errors of our opponents\u201d when attacking. Lorenzo Pellegrini did exactly that, scoring the game\u2019s only goal on a deflected shot after the ball had run kindly into his path from a tackle on the edge of the Verona area. Milan, meanwhile, looked every bit as confused on the pitch as they have been off it, falling 2-0 behind at home against Frosinone before eventually rallying to draw 3-3. They could have won the game in the end, Mario Balotelli striking the bar deep into injury time having earlier missed a penalty. But they had been losing in the 90th minute. They have now taken four points from as many games under Brocchi, a pathetic return when you consider that their opponents have all come from Serie&nbsp;A\u2019s bottom six. The decision to fire Mihajlovic looks even more misguided today than it did at the time. One can only imagine what Squinzi makes of it all. The Sassuolo owner is a lifelong Milan fan, to the point that he even has a red-and-black striped iPhone cover. Back when his own club were closing in on promotion to Serie&nbsp;A back in 2013, Squinzi was asked who he would want to win if they faced the Rossoneri. \u201cI have no doubts,\u201d he replied. \u201cI will support Milan.\u201d He later changed his tune, declaring that he would be neutral. A good thing, too, since Sassuolo have now won four out of six head-to-head meetings in Serie&nbsp;A. \u201cIt feels like one of life\u2019s big jokes,\u201d he confessed in March. \u201cFor a Milan fan who has followed the team since 1949 to watch the team that he supports getting beaten repeatedly by the one that he owns.\u201d Squinzi has distanced himself, however, from suggestions that he could buy the Rossoneri himself one day. Sassuolo\u2019s squad, he says, has nothing to envy of Milan\u2019s. As of Sunday, the league table supports that assertion. Talking points \u2022 That late Milan equaliser was a hammer blow to Frosinone\u2019s prospects of top-flight survival, but Palermo have given themselves hope by beating Sampdoria. The Sicilians moved level on points with 17th-placed Carpi, who lost at Juventus, although they remain behind on goal difference (both head-to-head matches ended in a draw). Udinese, three points further ahead, could yet be vulnerable after they were thrashed 5-1 at home by Torino. \u2022 Not a bad goal from Andrea Belotti in that Torino win, albeit facilitated by the near total absence of an Udinese defence. \u2022 Likewise, Oliver Kragl\u2019s long-range free-kick against Milan was beautifully struck, but Gianluigi Donnarumma should really have done better. \u2022 Coolest finish of the weekend belonged to Miroslav Klose, who delayed long enough when clean through on goal to sit Samir Handanovic down before chipping the Inter goalkeeper. Lazio\u2019s results since appointing Simone Inzaghi have been mixed, with wins against Empoli, Palermo and now Inter offset by defeats against Sampdoria and (less surprisingly) Juventus, but his players, at least, seem convinced. Klose, Keita and Antonio Candreva were all heard telling reporters on Sunday night that they hoped he would stay on beyond the end of this season. \u2022 The race for second place resumes on Monday, with both Napoli and Roma playing evening games, but Luciano Spalletti delivered some good news early when he confirmed that Kevin Strootman would start for the Giallorossi \u2013 the first time that he has done so since blowing out his knee against Fiorentina 463 days ago, all the way back in January 2015. Results: Chievo 0-0 Fiorentina, Empoli 0-0 Bologna, Juventus 2-0 Carpi, Lazio 2-0 Inter, Milan 3-3 Frosinone, Palermo 2-0 Sampdoria, Sassuolo 1-0 Verona, Udinese 1-5 Torino.",

Little wonder Di\u00a0Francesco recently chose to extend his contract through to 2019.</p> <p>He had previously been linked with Milan. When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/12/sinisa-mihajlovic-sacked-milan-christian-brocchi-silvio-berlusconi\" title=\"\">the <em>Rossoneri</em> fired Sinisa Mihajlovic</a>, no less an authority than Arrigo Sacchi suggested Silvio Berlusconi hire Di\u00a0Francesco as his replacement. The club named Cristian Brocchi as caretaker until the end of this season instead.</p> <p>The painful truth for Milan is that Di\u00a0Francesco might not have accepted the job if it were offered. Asked at the start of April where he we has headed next in his career, the manager replied: \u201cWherever there is no confusion. And Sassuolo, from this point of view, are among the best clubs in Italy.\u201d</p> <p>Milan, under those same terms, must be among the very worst. From the directionless transfer policy that has seen the club veer from recycling former stars on the cheap into a much-needed but poorly executed splurge last summer, through to a divided board and endless misinformation regarding potential investors, it is easy to see why Di\u00a0Francesco might not view them as a desirable employers.</p> <p>And that was before his team overtook Milan on Sunday. Sassuolo did not play well at home against last-placed Verona, mustering just six shots to the visitors\u2019 16. But another mantra of Di\u00a0Francesco\u2019s is that his team should \u201clive off the errors of our opponents\u201d when attacking. Lorenzo Pellegrini did exactly that, scoring the game\u2019s only goal on a deflected shot after the ball had run kindly into his path from a tackle on the edge of the Verona area.</p> <p>Milan, meanwhile, looked every bit as confused on the pitch as they have been off it, falling 2-0 behind at home against Frosinone before eventually rallying to draw 3-3. They could have won the game in the end, Mario Balotelli striking the bar deep into injury time having earlier missed a penalty. But they had been losing in the 90th minute.</p> <p>They have now taken four points from as many games under Brocchi, a pathetic return when you consider that their opponents have all come from Serie\u00a0A\u2019s bottom six. The decision to fire Mihajlovic looks <a href=\"http://www.gazzettaworld.com/features/mihajlovic-hampered-by-rocky-relationship-with-ac-milan-president/\" title=\"\">even more misguided today than it did at the time</a>.</p> <p>One can only imagine what Squinzi makes of it all. The Sassuolo owner is a lifelong Milan fan, to the point that he even has a red-and-black striped iPhone cover. Back when his own club were closing in on promotion to Serie\u00a0A back in 2013, Squinzi was asked who he would want to win if they faced the <em>Rossoneri</em>. \u201cI have no doubts,\u201d he replied. \u201cI will support Milan.\u201d</p> <p>He later changed his tune, declaring that he would be neutral. A good thing, too, since Sassuolo have now won four out of six head-to-head meetings in Serie\u00a0A. \u201cIt feels like one of life\u2019s big jokes,\u201d he confessed in March. \u201cFor a Milan fan who has followed the team since 1949 to watch the team that he supports getting beaten repeatedly by the one that he owns.\u201d</p> <p>Squinzi has distanced himself, however, from suggestions that he could buy the <em>Rossoneri</em> himself one day. Sassuolo\u2019s squad, he says, has nothing to envy of Milan\u2019s. As of Sunday, the league table supports that assertion.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 That late Milan equaliser was a hammer blow to Frosinone\u2019s prospects of top-flight survival, but Palermo have given themselves hope by beating Sampdoria. The Sicilians moved level on points with 17th-placed Carpi, who lost at Juventus, although they remain behind on goal difference (both head-to-head matches ended in a draw). Udinese, three points further ahead, could yet be vulnerable after they were thrashed 5-1 at home by Torino.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fabiofulco/status/726756883881713666\" title=\"\">Not a bad goal from Andrea Belotti in that Torino win</a>, albeit facilitated by the near total absence of an Udinese defence.</p> <p>\u2022 Likewise, Oliver Kragl\u2019s long-range free-kick against Milan was beautifully struck, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/726822274423123973\" title=\"\">Gianluigi Donnarumma should really have done better</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Coolest finish of the weekend belonged to Miroslav Klose, who delayed long enough when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SerieAchannel/status/726848393977307136\" title=\"\">clean through on goal to sit Samir Handanovic down before chipping the Inter goalkeeper</a>. Lazio\u2019s results since appointing Simone Inzaghi have been mixed, with wins against Empoli, Palermo and now Inter offset by defeats against Sampdoria and (less surprisingly) Juventus, but his players, at least, seem convinced. Klose, Keita and Antonio Candreva were all heard telling reporters on Sunday night that they hoped he would stay on beyond the end of this season.</p> <p>\u2022 The race for second place resumes on Monday, with both Napoli and Roma playing evening games, but Luciano Spalletti delivered some good news early when he confirmed that Kevin Strootman would start for the <em>Giallorossi</em> \u2013 the first time that he has done so since blowing out his knee against Fiorentina 463 days ago, all the way back in January 2015.</p> <p><strong>Results: </strong>Chievo 0-0 Fiorentina, Empoli 0-0 Bologna, Juventus 2-0 Carpi, Lazio 2-0 Inter, Milan 3-3 Frosinone, Palermo 2-0 Sampdoria, Sassuolo 1-0 Verona, Udinese 1-5 Torino.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s first No 1 hit of the 1960s was What Do You Want to Make Those Eyes at Me For? by Emile Ford and the Checkmates. Ford, who has died aged 78, was the first black British male singer to top the charts, and went on to a&nbsp;career as an acoustics engineer. In 1960, Ford had four more Top 20 hits, beginning with another standard, On a Slow Boat to China. This&nbsp;was followed by You\u2019ll Never Know What You\u2019re Missing, Them There Eyes and Counting Teardrops, the last of which reached No 6 in the charts. Ford\u2019s first hit launched him on a frantic few years of broadcasts and touring. He appeared several times on Sunday Night at the London Palladium, as well as other television music shows. Most of his live performances were as part of package shows featuring numerous acts. He toured with such luminaries as Bobby Darin, the Everly Brothers, the Shadows and Duane Eddy. He was a charismatic performer, as witnessed by the future Rolling Stones manager, Andrew Loog Oldham. The teenage Oldham saw Ford at the Granada cinema in Kettering, sitting on the edge of the stage with his feet in the orchestra pit and getting the audience to sing along with him. \u201cThe hairs on the back of my neck tingled,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI&nbsp;was in love with showbiz.\u201d In 1962 Ford topped the bill at New Brighton, with the Beatles as a support act. Soon afterwards he decided to continue as a solo artist, leaving the Checkmates to become the backing group for his protege, Jimmy Justice. Within a couple of years, though, Ford gave up performing to return to his first love, electronics. He was born in Castries, St Lucia, into one of the island\u2019s leading families. His father, Frederick Miller, was a local politician who became the island\u2019s minister of health and social services. His mother, Madge Murray, was a classical soprano who performed throughout the Caribbean and was the daughter of the founder of St Lucia\u2019s philharmonic orchestra. Madge also encouraged participation in the arts by the island\u2019s young people. In the mid-1950s Madge, Emile and his two sisters moved to London, where Emile studied engineering at Tottenham Polytechnic. There he took up the guitar and by 1958 he had formed a small group to play pop and rock\u2019n\u2019roll songs. The band entered and won a talent contest at the first Soho Village Fair. The&nbsp;prize was a recording contract with Pye, a small record company then enjoying success with Lonnie Donegan. What Do You Want to Make Those Eyes at Me For? was originally planned as the B side of the first single to be recorded by Ford and the Checkmates, who included George and Dave&nbsp;Sweetnam, Emile\u2019s half brothers from Madge\u2019s second&nbsp;marriage, to Rudolph Sweetnam, a Caribbean civil servant. Another song, Don\u2019t Tell Me Your Troubles, was scheduled as the A&nbsp;side, but Pye executives correctly saw greater potential in What Do You Want to Make Those Eyes at Me For?, which had been composed in 1916. With assistance from airplay on Radio Luxembourg, the record rapidly climbed the charts and by mid-December 1959 it was listed as a joint No 1 with the similarly titled What Do You Want? by Adam Faith, remaining there for six weeks. Ford once said: \u201cI was gifted with the ability to see and hear sound differently from other people and this gift allowed me to make first-class recordings\u201d, and from the beginning he took control of the technical side of his sound. He co-produced his first record with Joe Meek and rearranged the studio microphones before his debut appearance on the BBC Light Programme\u2019s Saturday Club. He travelled with his own public address system, which he set up at each venue. The tour bus for the Checkmates and the Fordettes, a quartet of female backing singers who later became the Breakaways, was even fitted out with equipment to allow rehearsals en route. Ford\u2019s later work as what he called a \u201csound scientist\u2019\u2019 was devoted to attempts to perfect recorded sound and to design pre-recorded backing tracks to be used on stage, an early version of what would become karaoke. For several years he ran a recording studio in Barbados, before conducting acoustic experiments in the north of Sweden. He&nbsp;later moved to California. Ford\u2019s recordings of the early 1960s have been reissued on CD several times and the Checkmates legacy is maintained in occasional shows by a trio&nbsp;led by Raye Du-Val, the drummer in&nbsp;the last lineup of Ford\u2019s own group. Ford is survived by four daughters and three sons, and by two sisters, one half-sister and two half-brothers. \u2022 Emile Ford (Michael Emile Telford Miller), singer and acoustics engineer, born 16 October 1937; died 11 April 2016",

      "bodyText": "\u201cHow many of you have heard Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s new album, Lemonade?\u201d asks the Dixie Chicks\u2019 lead voice and guitarist, Natalie Maines. The feeble cheer that wafts up from the full house indicates that Lemonade hasn\u2019t made it on to many MP3 players. Undeterred, Maines announces that the next song, the country track Daddy Lessons, will be a cover from Lemonade. It turns out to be sensational. In the Chicks\u2019 hands, a song that charitably analyses male infidelity turns into a steely lament signalling that forgiveness is a long way off. If any country band could successfully reinterpret Beyonc\u00e9, her fellow Texans would unquestionably be the ones; fearlessness has been their hallmark for 18 years. Beyonc\u00e9 was still crazy in love with Jay Z when the Dixie Chicks last headlined a European tour, and the O2 was a vacant shell when their most recent album came out. Before \u201cthe incident\u201d \u2013 as the trio call the conservative fury over Maines\u2019 comment in 2003 that she was ashamed George W Bush was a fellow Texan \u2013 they were the top-selling female band in the US. Despite a Grammy-winning resurgence in 2006, a decade of near silence followed. Their return seems remarkably timely. Although they offer no new material, the 15 songs (plus cover versions) they play could have been written today, so closely do they capture the tenor of the times. Goodbye Earl, a domestic abuse story-song from 1999, is a furious performance piece featuring a montage of mugshots and newspaper headlines (\u201cOJ set free\u201d); the intensity produces thunderous applause. The breezy Ready to Run is repurposed as political comedy: unflattering cartoon images of Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and the other presidential hopefuls skitter clownishly past on a screen, ensuring there will be no White House invitation for the Chicks. It ends with a sardonic explosion of red, white and blue ticker tape shot from cannons. Maines, fiddler Martie Maguire and banjo/Dobro player Emily Robison have invested in rock-band production, complete with expensive lighting and monochrome video footage. Here they are playing atop old Cadillacs; there they are racing heedlessly through a city nightscape, whiskey bottles aloft. There\u2019s even a costume change. Somehow, these add-ons blend seamlessly with the country-bluegrass core, founded on the trio\u2019s spun-steel harmonies and glittering musicianship. There are segments from their Rick Rubin-produced last album, notably The Long Way Around and Lubbock or Leave It, where they can\u2019t quash an urge to rock; equally, however, Travelin\u2019 Soldier is the essence of heartfelt southern balladry. Every act currently touring has been including a Prince song in its setlist, and the Chicks\u2019 choice is Nothing Compares 2 U, which Maines dispenses with almost too much billowy gusto. A happier meeting of country and indie is a bluegrass cover of Can\u2019t Feel My Face that takes the Weeknd\u2019s song, and by extension the rest of the set, to mind-bending places. These days, the self-proclaimed renegades are blue state darlings rather than unalloyed country stars. May their second coming be fruitful. \u2022 At SSE Hydro, Glasgow, 3 May.

      "bodyText": "He was regarded as one of the greatest mountaineers of the modern era, lost in an ice avalanche on Shishapangma, in Tibet, 16 years ago. Now the body of the American climber Alex Lowe, aged 40 when he died, has finally been found along with that of his climbing companion, 29-year old cameraman David Bridges, also American. Fittingly perhaps, the bodies were discovered by the Swiss mountaineer Ueli Steck \u2013 regarded as one of the the world\u2019s best current mountaineers \u2013 and his companion David Goettler, while acclimatising for an attempt on the south face of the 8,031metre-high (26,350ft) Shishapangma. The find brings closure to the lingering tragedy of their deaths on the world\u2019s 14th highest mountain. Lowe and Bridges had been on the mountain as part of nine-person team when they got lost on a 1999 expedition, which planned to first climb Shishapangma and then descend it on skis, in what they hoped would be the first US ski descent of an 8,000m peak. The two were buried and killed when an ice cliff collapsed above them as they crossed a glacier, with a third companion, Conrad Anker \u2013 whose exploits were documented in the recent film Meru \u2013 surviving. Anker suffered broken ribs and a dislocated shoulder. At the time of his death Lowe was regarded as one on the best in his field \u2013 not least for his extraordinary physiological gifts at altitude, which earned him the nickname the \u201cLung on Legs\u201d and \u201cthe Mutant\u201d. As the writer and climber Jim Perrin noted in his obituary for the Guardian, Lowe was not only supremely physically gifted, with a slew of hard ascents under his belt, but also an early adopter of using the internet to publicise his climbs. \u201cOne significant factor in Lowe\u2019s rise to worldwide fame,\u201d wrote Perrin, \u201cwas his mastery of the internet technology that has allowed certain kinds of climbs to be photographed and marketed. \u201cClimbing has thus become interesting to a broader segment of the population, and some companies unconnected with the activity are using it as part of their marketing images.\u201d Lowe, from Bozeman, Montana, had made difficult climbs all over the world, including Nepal\u2019s Kwangde and Kusum Kanguru, and twice reached the summit of Mount Everest. In Peru, he climbed the south-west buttress of Taulliraju. Familiar with the risks of high-end mountaineering, he had been involved in the high-profile rescue of a group of trapped Spanish climbers on Denali, the highest peak in the US, four years before his death, carrying the stricken climbers on his back during the rescue. Lowe, as Perrin wrote, downplayed his role. \u201cIt was one of those things you do because you have to do it, one of those Herculean things where you get a lot of adrenaline going and you just do it.\u201d Confirmation of the discovery of Lowe and Bridges, came in a statement from Lowe\u2019s widow, Jennifer, now married to his friend Anker. She said Steck and Gottlieb had discovered the remains of two people in a partially melted glacier and described the details of their clothing and backpacks to her. \u201cAlex and David vanished, were captured and frozen in time. Sixteen years of life has been lived and now they are found. We are thankful,\u201d Jenni Lowe-Anker said. In the last paragraph of her memoir, Forget Me Not, Lowe-Anker had predicted a day would come when her former husband\u2019s body would be found. \u201cAlex will melt out of the glacier one day \u2026 and I do not look forward to it.\u201d In the statement, released by the charitable foundation founded in Lowe\u2019s name, she added: \u201cAlex\u2019s parents are thankful to know that their son\u2019s body has been found and that Conrad, the boys and I will make our pilgrimage to Shishapangma. It is time to put Alex to rest.\u201d Anker also said the discovery has brought closure and relief to him. He told Outside magazine that although he had not seen photos of the remains, he was convinced they are those of Lowe and Bridges. \u201cThey were close to each other. Blue and red North Face backpacks. Yellow Koflach [mountaineering] boots. It was all that gear from that time period. They were pretty much the only two climbers who were there.\u201d Bridges, 29, of Aspen, Colorado, was an accomplished high-altitude climber and cinematographer.",

    "webTitle": "The Portland Timbers rediscover their form, and David Villa wins again", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Whoever advised never to change a winning team forgot to tell Caleb Porter. The Portland Timbers entered the 2016 season as defending MLS Cup champions and yet it seemingly meant nothing to the 41-year-old, who went some way to abandoning the pragmatic and shrewd philosophy that served him and his side so well last term. He became an idealist again, to his detriment as the Timbers won just two of their opening eight fixtures. But against Toronto FC on Sunday, Porter the realist returned, and so did the Portland team of 2015. They were a counterattacking side once more, sitting deep to absorb opposition pressure before striking hard on the break at the first possible opportunity. Even when Portland had the ball they were content with holding it deep, hitting the channels when they could, using the pace of Darren Mattocks, Fanendo Adi and Lucas Melano. The former, in particular, was impressive, giving Diego Valeri an outlet almost every time he looked forward. Mattocks has shown scant sign of his ability since making the switch to Portland, but against TFC the forward demonstrated the kind of player he could be for the Timbers, underlining why Porter was so keen to take him to the club over the off-season. It wasn\u2019t the sort of display Porter will pin up on his office wall at Providence Park as a precedent for all that he stands for as coach. In years gone by (and in just a few games gone by too) the Timbers would have attempted to outrun and outplay Toronto FC, but such an approach often saw Porter\u2019s side reap less than the effort they were expending. Sunday was the reverse of that. They got the maximum for what they put in. And that\u2019s what Portland did last season, particularly in the latter third of the campaign when Porter handed himself over to the pragmatic style that would finally see the Timbers fulfill their potential. It\u2019s perhaps understandable that having delivered the ultimate result by winning MLS Cup Porter targeted philosophical fulfillment this year, but the manner with which he conceded against Toronto FC where he had gone wrong \u2013 just like he has done before \u2013 showcases what makes him the most adaptable coach in North American soccer. GR The Red Bulls chip is back but Dallas\u2019s compass is missing There\u2019s an argument that the New York Red Bulls MVP last season was the oft-referenced \u201cchip\u201d on their collective shoulders, after a turbulent 2014-15 off-season saw them written off before a ball had been kicked. After losing six of their first seven games, the Shield holders had plenty of critics lining up to write them off again this year \u2014 but the last week has seen the team win two games, including a 4-0 victory on Friday night over FC Dallas, their main rivals last season. After the game Jesse Marsch was talking about the chip on the shoulder being back \u2014 with particular reference to the determination his side had shown in keeping a first clean sheet of the season after the extensive criticism of their defense. And with the goals finally flying in at the other end, defense had been a priority this week. Friday started with a move for veteran center-back Aurelien Collin from Orlando City, and concluded with Chris Duvall being given another shot to try and counter the movement of Maxi Urruti for Dallas. Duvall did fine, though in truth the game turned out to be an ideal confidence boost for New York, as Dallas\u2019s celebrated attack never had much chance to threaten them. The high press, that saw New York steamroller the opposition last year, was back with a vengeance, and Dallas\u2019s midfield were first overrun, and ultimately frustrated and petulant en route to an emphatic defeat. Dallas\u2019s week has been as poor as New York\u2019s has been encouraging. They\u2019re always good for at least one lopsided loss per season, but already this year they\u2019ve had a 5-0 defeat in Houston, last week\u2019s 3-0 shambles to Vancouver, and now Friday\u2019s debacle. The holding duo of Carlos Gruezo and Victor Ulloa have not yet combined at the base of the midfield in the way Ulloa and Kelyn Acosta did last season, and it\u2019s meant that Dallas have not been as fluid on the road in 2016. New York\u2019s players were understandably buoyed afterwards, but still very aware of their poor start and anxious not to get ahead of themselves. But in turning anxiety into intensity they\u2019ve made a lot of progress even from the jittery team that played out the last few minutes against Orlando last week. From the set piece that won the game to the three second-half finishes that turned it into a romp, there was a sharpness and fluidity to their play that\u2019s been absent this season. Just as in 2015 they appear to be at their best when there\u2019s most to prove. GP Jordan Morris is finding his feet in Seattle US soccer culture being what it is, there was always the worry that Jordan Morris would burn up on re-entry from the hype stratosphere when he eventually tried to start his professional career at a club. In that spirit, Morris\u2019s decision to reject Werder Bremen\u2019s offer for a hometown contract with Seattle looked to be a prudent move \u2013 Morris would get his chance to develop at an appropriate pace, and would see the field while serving an apprenticeship under the league\u2019s deadliest goal scoring tandem of Obafemi Martins and Clint Dempsey. That was the idea anyway \u2013 until Martins abruptly left for China just before the start of the season. Not for the first time in his fledgling career, Morris got fast tracked. The initial results were perhaps predictable \u2014 with the rest of the team struggling to find a rhythm at short notice, Morris\u2019s intelligent running looked less of a usual option to have and more like one more variable to worry about accommodating. And he wasn\u2019t scoring. In other circumstances that wouldn\u2019t have mattered as much as he was eased into the team, but with Seattle where they are right now, a non-scoring goalscorer is not an option. But then Morris got his first goal in a win over Philadelphia two weeks ago. Then he got another one last week in Colorado, even if it was a consolation goal in a 3-1 loss in Colorado symptomatic of Seattle\u2019s curiously anonymous season. And on Saturday, Morris made it three in three, as he grabbed an 88th minute winner over a Columbus team whose slow start to the year had not stopped them giving Seattle fits in the first half. It was a scrappy goal off a rebound, but it was a vital goal, and it was in line with Morris\u2019s growing confidence. Afterwards, he told reporters about the relief that came from finally scoring: \u201cYou get that pressure off your back. Each game you don\u2019t score, you\u2019re feeling more and more pressure and it kind of eats at you while you\u2019re playing ... [After the first one] you just go out there and play a little freer and with more confidence and goals like the goal today kind of just come...Games get more fun. You don\u2019t think as much.\u201d Given his team\u2019s slow start, Sigi Schmidt is just thinking about trying to solidify things with back-to-back home wins, when San Jose visit next week. At least with Morris now eased into his team, he\u2019s got one less thing to worry about. GP Joe Bendik is proving his doubters wrong at Orlando City As far as off-season moves go, Joe Bendik\u2019s switch from Toronto FC to Orlando City was rather underwhelming. In Canada he was a second pick, even if he found himself thrust into the first team following injury to Stefan Frei last season. Even as TFC\u2019s temporary No1 he had his critics. In Central Florida, however, the 27-year-old has turned into the keeper so few thought he could be. Sure, Manuel Neuer and David De Gea probably won\u2019t have competition from Bendik, but Orlando have more than found an able replacement for Tally Hall. The New York native pretty much single-handedly (and sometimes double-handedly) ensured that his side escaped Gillette Stadium with a point, making a number of saves as Orlando scampered back to Florida with a 2-2 draw. Such has been the standard of Bendik\u2019s recent performances it\u2019s worth recalling that his Orlando City career didn\u2019t start so well. Questions over his ability and presence in particular were raised as early as pre-season, with performances against Real Salt Lake and Chicago Fire in the opening two outings of the season only heightening concern over the 27-year-old\u2019s place in the team. Since then, though, Bendik has answers such questions held against him. On more than one occasion he has been the difference between good and bad results for Orlando City, shining in what has been a difficult start to the season for the Lions. His standard has been particularly impressive considering the lack of protection he has been afforded this season, with the departure of so many key defenders in such a short space of time unsettling everything in front of him. Bendik himself is well aware of the critics who question his ability at MLS level. \u201cAll you can do is respect the person you\u2019re taking the place of and be yourself, and I think that\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried to do here,\u201d he told the Orlando Sentinel back in March. But his performances of late have done more to quell critics than anything he could have said through the media. His off-season switch to Orlando no longer seems so underwhelming. GR David Villa finally wins again At least one of New York City\u2019s designated players has been value for money. As David Villa lay prostrate on the Yankee Stadium turf following Montreal\u2019s late equalizer on Wednesday night, it was hard not to feel sorry for a player who\u2019s been as close to a one man team as can be seen in MLS. A one man team who sometimes has to play against his own players. When New York kicked off again on Saturday afternoon, it took them just 35 seconds to concede \u2014 Josh Saunders making a hash of a routine clearance to gift Vancouver a lead. This season, such early setbacks been the cue for New York to, if not fold, labor unconvincingly, or just as dispiritingly, get back into a game at Villa\u2019s prompting, only to throw it away at the last. Villa duly provided the optimum phase two with an opportunist run and finish to level the scores, late in the first half, before serving up a beautiful volleyed finish from an Andrea Pirlo corner to the back post. NYC FC being NYC FC however, nothing is simple \u2014 even against a Vancouver defense that has been shaky in 2016 compared to 2015\u2019s solidity, and which had to rotate defenders following a midweek draw at Sporting KC. New York duly gave up a penalty on the hour for what looked like another day\u2019s frustration. And even when off-season signing Steven Mendoza put New York ahead in the 73rd minute, the mood in the Bronx still felt more like what was transpiring was a crisis than an opportunity as they fretted through the remaining 17 minutes. You couldn\u2019t blame the fans, who\u2019d yet to witness a home win in five attempts this season, but on this occasion, New York kept their cool, and were even pressing for a fourth goal as the clock ran down. It was a big win, and if anyone deserved one it\u2019s been David Villa \u2014 the club captain has been faultless throughout New York\u2019s struggles. Pirlo has been intermittently effective, and even less so on the tight Yankee Stadium pitch, and Frank Lampard has been ... absent. But Villa has worked ceaselessly and is the only one of that trio who can currently point beyond the replica shirt sales data to demonstrate his worth to the team. And on Saturday, almost despite his team at times, he got the win. GP",

      "body": "<p><br />Whoever advised never to change a winning team forgot to tell Caleb Porter. The Portland Timbers entered the 2016 season as defending MLS Cup champions and yet it seemingly meant nothing to the 41-year-old, who went some way to abandoning the pragmatic and shrewd philosophy that served him and his side so well last term. He became an idealist again, to his detriment as the Timbers won just two of their opening eight fixtures.</p> <p>But against Toronto FC on Sunday, Porter the realist returned, and so did the Portland team of 2015. They were a counterattacking side once more, sitting deep to absorb opposition pressure before striking hard on the break at the first possible opportunity. Even when Portland had the ball they were content with holding it deep, hitting the channels when they could, using the pace of Darren Mattocks, Fanendo Adi and Lucas Melano.</p> <p>The former, in particular, was impressive, giving Diego Valeri an outlet almost every time he looked forward. Mattocks has shown scant sign of his ability since making the switch to Portland, but against TFC the forward demonstrated the kind of player he could be for the Timbers, underlining why Porter was so keen to take him to the club over the off-season.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the sort of display Porter will pin up on his office wall at Providence Park as a precedent for all that he stands for as coach. In years gone by (and in just a few games gone by too) the Timbers would have attempted to outrun and outplay Toronto FC, but such an approach often saw Porter\u2019s side reap less than the effort they were expending. Sunday was the reverse of that. They got the maximum for what they put in.</p> <p>And that\u2019s what Portland did last season, particularly in the latter third of the campaign when Porter handed himself over to the pragmatic style that would finally see the Timbers fulfill their potential. It\u2019s perhaps understandable that having delivered the ultimate result by winning MLS Cup Porter targeted philosophical fulfillment this year, but the manner with which he conceded against Toronto FC where he had gone wrong \u2013 just like he has done before \u2013 showcases what makes him the most adaptable coach in North American soccer. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2><strong>The Red Bulls chip is back but Dallas\u2019s compass is missing</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s an argument that the New York Red Bulls MVP last season was the oft-referenced \u201cchip\u201d on their collective shoulders, after a turbulent 2014-15 off-season saw them written off before a ball had been kicked.</p> <p>After losing six of their first seven games, the Shield holders had plenty of critics lining up to write them off again this year \u2014 but the last week has seen the team win two games, including a 4-0 victory on Friday night over FC Dallas, their main rivals last season. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGuSndwiioM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DGuSndwiioM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>After the game Jesse Marsch was talking about the chip on the shoulder being back \u2014 with particular reference to the determination his side had shown in keeping a first clean sheet of the season after the extensive criticism of their defense. And with the goals finally flying in at the other end, defense had been a priority this week. Friday started with a move for veteran center-back Aurelien Collin from Orlando City, and concluded with Chris Duvall being given another shot to try and counter the movement of Maxi Urruti for Dallas.</p> <p>Duvall did fine, though in truth the game turned out to be an ideal confidence boost for New York, as Dallas\u2019s celebrated attack never had much chance to threaten them. The high press, that saw New York steamroller the opposition last year, was back with a vengeance, and Dallas\u2019s midfield were first overrun, and ultimately frustrated and petulant en route to an emphatic defeat.</p> <p>Dallas\u2019s week has been as poor as New York\u2019s has been encouraging. They\u2019re always good for at least one lopsided loss per season, but already this year they\u2019ve had a 5-0 defeat in Houston, last week\u2019s 3-0 shambles to Vancouver, and now Friday\u2019s debacle. The holding duo of Carlos Gruezo and Victor Ulloa have not yet combined at the base of the midfield in the way Ulloa and Kelyn Acosta did last season, and it\u2019s meant that Dallas have not been as fluid on the road in 2016. </p> <p>New York\u2019s players were understandably buoyed afterwards, but still very aware of their poor start and anxious not to get ahead of themselves. But in turning anxiety into intensity they\u2019ve made a lot of progress even from the jittery team that played out the last few minutes against Orlando last week. From the set piece that won the game to the three second-half finishes that turned it into a romp, there was a sharpness and fluidity to their play that\u2019s been absent this season. Just as in 2015 they appear to be at their best when there\u2019s most to prove. <strong>GP</strong></p> <h2><strong>Jordan Morris is finding his feet in Seattle</strong></h2> <p>US soccer culture being what it is, there was always the worry that Jordan Morris would burn up on re-entry from the hype stratosphere when he eventually tried to start his professional career at a club. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0Wm0Ml80ic\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k0Wm0Ml80ic?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In that spirit, Morris\u2019s decision to reject Werder Bremen\u2019s offer for a hometown contract with Seattle looked to be a prudent move \u2013 Morris would get his chance to develop at an appropriate pace, and would see the field while serving an apprenticeship under the league\u2019s deadliest goal scoring tandem of Obafemi Martins and Clint Dempsey.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/01/copa-america-usa-40-man-roster\">Copa America: Klinsmann names Pulisic and Morris in 40-man US roster</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That was the idea anyway \u2013 until Martins abruptly left for China just before the start of the season. Not for the first time in his fledgling career, Morris got fast tracked.<br />The initial results were perhaps predictable \u2014 with the rest of the team struggling to find a rhythm at short notice, Morris\u2019s intelligent running looked less of a usual option to have and more like one more variable to worry about accommodating. And he wasn\u2019t scoring. </p> <p>In other circumstances that wouldn\u2019t have mattered as much as he was eased into the team, but with Seattle where they are right now, a non-scoring goalscorer is not an option. </p> <p>But then Morris got his first goal in a win over Philadelphia two weeks ago. Then he got another one last week in Colorado, even if it was a consolation goal in a 3-1 loss in Colorado symptomatic of Seattle\u2019s curiously anonymous season. </p> <p>And on Saturday, Morris made it three in three, as he grabbed an 88th minute winner over a Columbus team whose slow start to the year had not stopped them giving Seattle fits in the first half. It was a scrappy goal off a rebound, but it was a vital goal, and it was in line with Morris\u2019s growing confidence.</p> <p>Afterwards, he told reporters about the relief that came from finally scoring:<br />\u201cYou get that pressure off your back. Each game you don\u2019t score, you\u2019re feeling more and more pressure and it kind of eats at you while you\u2019re playing ... [After the first one] you just go out there and play a little freer and with more confidence and goals like the goal today kind of just come...Games get more fun. You don\u2019t think as much.\u201d</p> <p>Given his team\u2019s slow start, Sigi Schmidt is just thinking about trying to solidify things with back-to-back home wins, when San Jose visit next week. At least with Morris now eased into his team, he\u2019s got one less thing to worry about. <strong>GP</strong></p> <h2><strong>Joe Bendik is proving his doubters wrong at Orlando City</strong></h2> <p>As far as off-season moves go, Joe Bendik\u2019s switch from Toronto FC to Orlando City was rather underwhelming. In Canada he was a second pick, even if he found himself thrust into the first team following injury to Stefan Frei last season. Even as TFC\u2019s temporary No1 he had his critics. In Central Florida, however, the 27-year-old has turned into the keeper so few thought he could be.</p> <p>Sure, Manuel Neuer and David De Gea probably won\u2019t have competition from Bendik, but Orlando have more than found an able replacement for Tally Hall. The New York native pretty much single-handedly (and sometimes double-handedly) ensured that his side escaped Gillette Stadium with a point, making a number of saves as Orlando scampered back to Florida with a 2-2 draw.</p> <p>Such has been the standard of Bendik\u2019s recent performances it\u2019s worth recalling that his Orlando City career didn\u2019t start so well. Questions over his ability and presence in particular were raised as early as pre-season, with performances against Real Salt Lake and Chicago Fire in the opening two outings of the season only heightening concern over the 27-year-old\u2019s place in the team. </p> <p>Since then, though, Bendik has answers such questions held against him. On more than one occasion he has been the difference between good and bad results for Orlando City, shining in what has been a difficult start to the season for the Lions. His standard has been particularly impressive considering the lack of protection he has been afforded this season, with the departure of so many key defenders in such a short space of time unsettling everything in front of him.</p> <p>Bendik himself is well aware of the critics who question his ability at MLS level. \u201cAll you can do is respect the person you\u2019re taking the place of and be yourself, and I think that\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried to do here,\u201d he told the Orlando Sentinel back in March. But his performances of late have done more to quell critics than anything he could have said through the media. His off-season switch to Orlando no longer seems so underwhelming. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2><strong>David Villa finally wins again</strong></h2> <p>At least one of New York City\u2019s designated players has been value for money. As David Villa lay prostrate on the Yankee Stadium turf following Montreal\u2019s late equalizer on Wednesday night, it was hard not to feel sorry for a player who\u2019s been as close to a one man team as can be seen in MLS.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7i8hYrL2ao\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T7i8hYrL2ao?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>A one man team who sometimes has to play against his own players. When New York kicked off again on Saturday afternoon, it took them just 35 seconds to concede \u2014 Josh Saunders making a hash of a routine clearance to gift Vancouver a lead. This season, such early setbacks been the cue for New York to, if not fold, labor unconvincingly, or just as dispiritingly, get back into a game at Villa\u2019s prompting, only to throw it away at the last.</p> <p>Villa duly provided the optimum phase two with an opportunist run and finish to level the scores, late in the first half, before serving up a beautiful volleyed finish from an Andrea Pirlo corner to the back post. </p> <p>NYC FC being NYC FC however, nothing is simple \u2014 even against a Vancouver defense that has been shaky in 2016 compared to 2015\u2019s solidity, and which had to rotate defenders following a midweek draw at Sporting KC. New York duly gave up a penalty on the hour for what looked like another day\u2019s frustration.</p> <p>And even when off-season signing Steven Mendoza put New York ahead in the 73rd minute, the mood in the Bronx still felt more like what was transpiring was a crisis than an opportunity as they fretted through the remaining 17 minutes. You couldn\u2019t blame the fans, who\u2019d yet to witness a home win in five attempts this season, but on this occasion, New York kept their cool, and were even pressing for a fourth goal as the clock ran down.</p> <p>It was a big win, and if anyone deserved one it\u2019s been David Villa \u2014 the club captain has been faultless throughout New York\u2019s struggles.

      "bodyText": "Avery Collins speaks with the snow-bro drawl typical of many young Coloradans. With his bloodshot, blue eyes peeking out from under blond curls and a low-slung hat, he could easily fit in with the stoners at a 4/20 festival. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a spiritual happening,\u201d he said recently. \u201cEverything is perfect, everything is pure bliss.\u201d But Collins isn\u2019t talking about the effects of marijuana. He\u2019s talking about the runner\u2019s high. The 25-year-old ultramarathoner is a marijuana user, just not the stereotypical couch-locked stoner living on junk food and video games. In the last three years, he\u2019s completed 30 ultramarathons \u2013 five of which were a hundred miles each \u2013 and a 200-mile race through the Rocky Mountains, which he won with a time of 65 hours. Avery says that eating cannabis edibles before and during a run, instead of slowing him down, as one might think, actually enhances the experience. \u201cIt was amazing,\u201d he recalls of his first time combining pot and running. \u201cIt helps me stay in the moment and embrace what\u2019s going on right then and there.\u201d Collins is quick to state that while he enjoys running high, he never uses it during races and doesn\u2019t think his success should be credited to pot. Currently, the World Anti-Doping Agency lists marijuana as a banned substance in competitions, and many high-profile marathons test runners for pot. Which raises the question: is marijuana a performance-enhancing drug? Despite the prohibition, running on weed has become an increasingly popular trend among athletes, who use it either as a way to avoid fatigue, boredom or anxiety during long runs, or as a pain-reliever and anti-inflammatory medication during recovery periods. Another leading ultramarathoner, Jenn Shelton, told the Wall Street Journal that she uses cannabis in her training, as does triathlete Clifford Drusinsky. And who could forget Arnold Schwarzenegger ripping a joint in the documentary Pumping Iron. Meanwhile, the legal cannabis industry has been carving out a place in the world of long-distance running. Marijuana edibles company Incredibles and bong manufacturer Roll-uh-Bowl have sponsored Collins, and the cannabis cultivation company Cresco Labs recently sponsored the Chicago marathon. Two years ago the 4/20 Games began touring the US, hosting runs and concerts to promote athletics among marijuana users. Online communities such as Cannafit and Norml athletics are connecting stoner athletes, along with running groups like Run On Grass in Denver. Neurobiological research While this dynamic may contradict the stoner stereotype, recent research in neurobiology suggests that marijuana and long-distance running may have more to do with each other than many think. \u201cThe runner\u2019s high, as it\u2019s been traditionally described, has been presumed to be caused by opioid peptides like endorphins,\u201d says Gregory Gerdeman, assistant professor of biology at Eckerd College who has studied the effect of exercise on mood and brain chemistry. But endorphins don\u2019t cross into the blood-brain barrier, he explains, so the natural euphoria that long-distance runners experience is likely not caused by endorphins, but by the brain\u2019s endocannabinoid system. When Collins (or anyone) consumes marijuana, it is the brain\u2019s cannabinoid receptors that receive the THC in marijuana and deliver the psychoactive effect. This endocannabinoid system also plays a part in regulating appetite, pain-sensation, emotions, memory, and much more. Dr Johannes Fuss, researcher at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, authored a study that, as he puts it, \u201cinvestigated the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate the emotional benefits after acute exercise, often termed as a runner\u2019s high\u201d. Fuss\u2019s work found that the endocannabinoid system plays a central role in the emotional aspects of running. \u201cSome researchers argue that long distance running might have evolved in our ancestors when forests were replaced by open savannas in Africa,\u201d Fuss said. \u201cThis land conversion allowed the chasing of prey by endurance running. Reduced sensation of pain and less anxiety through long-distance running would have been a benefit for running hunters.\u201d \u201cWhen volunteers exercise for 30 minutes, the level of the endocannabinoid anandamide in their bloodstream goes up,\u201d says Gerdeman. \u201cIn one study, we found that the increase of feelings of wellbeing in patients was tightly correlated to levels of anandamide in their bloodstream. So we started talking about anandamide as a neurobiological reward for running. It makes you feel good ... And anandamide acts like THC in many ways. It gets its name from ananda, which means bliss in sanskrit.\u201d A performance-enhancing drug? So far there have been no definitive studies on how marijuana and long-distance running work in concert. In her Wall Street Journal interview, Jenn Shelton said she never consumed marijuana during competition, because she believed it did enhance performance. It\u2019s not inconceivable that if the human brain\u2019s endocannabinoid system regulates fatigue, that an artificial stimulation of this system with marijuana could further reduce both physical and mental exhaustion, thereby bringing it ever closer to the designation of a performance enhancing drug. The World Anti-Doping Agency declined to be interviewed for this story, but said in a statement that in 2013 they raised the levels of acceptable marijuana in an athlete\u2019s system so that out-of-competition use would not disqualify them. Yet any use just before a sporting event remains prohibited. The Anti-Doping Agency are not alone in their distaste for pot. The NFL have often been criticized for their ban on bud, as many football players argue it\u2019s a healthy alternative to painkillers. Last week Indianapolis Colts punter Pat McAfee was immediately drug tested after tweeting out a few pot jokes on 4/20. The NCAA also has long-held a zero tolerance policy with marijuana, but is currently looking at softening their approach, under the argument that it is not a performance enhancing drug. Gerdeman warned that for anyone new to running (or marijuana, for that matter), it would probably be unwise to go mixing the two. \u201cIt\u2019s conceivable that cannabis could benefit someone who is just starting an exercise routine,\u201d he said, but \u201ccannabis use elevates the heart rate, so for someone who isn\u2019t used to exercising, it could make them lightheaded and have a spike in blood pressure. It could be dangerous for someone who is older with emergent cardiovascular disease.\u201d Whether marijuana is harmful, a performance enhancement, or somewhere in between, there is still a social stigma against cannabis that makes athletes reluctant to be associated with it. \u201cI\u2019d say 50% of the runners I meet are avid cannabis users, whether it\u2019s at night or all day or just during or after runs,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI\u2019d say almost none of them are open about it.\u201d \u201cI know a lot of long-distance runners that are in the closet about their cannabis use,\u201d says Chris Barnicle, a former professional runner turned marijuana advocate who promotes himself as \u201cThe World\u2019s Fastest Stoner\u201d. \u201cThere is an ignorant stereotype about people who use marijuana not being athletic, but that\u2019s because they aren\u2019t often represented. The public only sees a misrepresentation of people who do [hash] dabs all day long and aren\u2019t active.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Today\u2019s best bets, by Chris Cook One final thought regarding Aidan O\u2019Brien, who, immediately after his 1,000 Guineas triumph on Sunday, said something that illustrates just how embedded he is in the little world of Ballydoyle. He was discussing Minding\u2019s pedigree, she being by Galileo out of Lillie Langtry, both of whom were trained to win top-class races by O\u2019Brien. \u201cShe\u2019s our own blood,\u201d he said. \u201cHer mum and dad have been friends with our families for a long time.\u201d I suppose there would be some outside the racing bubble who would find it twee to discuss horses in that manner but there\u2019s nothing affected or lighthearted about O\u2019Brien when he says such a thing. He puts much less distance between himself and the horses than other top-tier Flat trainers and it may be part of his genius. Completing the thought, O\u2019Brien said of Minding\u2019s parents: \u201cWe would have known them intimately, professionally. Everyone in Ballydoyle and Coolmore would know them, which is a massive help. She\u2019s pure homebred.\u201d Today\u2019s nap, at Windsor, is down to 11-10 after 2-1 was available when betting opened on Sunday night. Walpole (5.10), from the 2,000 Guineas-winning yard of Hugo Palmer, is unbeaten in two, having won a Huntingdon bumper in October and then a Wolverhampton maiden in February, both times scoring with plenty in hand. The Wolves race is working out, since the third won next time while the fourth has since won three turf handicaps. One has to be careful about placing too much confidence in such things but on that form Walpole looks very nicely treated for his handicap debut off a mark of 77. He is a half-brother to the Coronation Stakes winner Rizeena and cost 110,000 guineas as a yearling, so Monday\u2019s contest is still some way below what he ought to be capable of. Kinglami (2.15) is interesting at 12-1 for a sprint handicap earlier on the card. He has a fine record over this course and distance and his running-on fifth for his new yard here last time suggested he was coming back to form. He has been dropped another 2lb, for what it\u2019s worth. In Bath\u2019s opener, you can get 14-1 about John Joiner (1.55). While he is a maiden after 11 runs, he was with Peter Makin last year, when that trainer achieved only a 3% strike-rate. He has now joined Peter Hedger (16% this year) and showed up well for a long way until getting tired on his Wolverhampton reappearance a month ago. Monday\u2019s step back in distance to five furlongs and a return to handicap company should certainly help. A useful 3lb is claimed by Josephine Gordon, half of whose six turf wins have been achieved around this tricky circuit. The trainer David Dennis sponsors some of Monday\u2019s races at Warwick and appears to have been preparing several runners specifically for the card. The Big Dipper (2.00) is interesting at 14-1 for a handicap hurdle, having won on his only previous attempt at this distance of three miles. He is only 4lb higher than for that success and wears a tongue tie for the first time, having not been seen since November. Tipping competition \u2013 a new week starts on Tuesday Congratulations to chris1623, who held on to win last week\u2019s competition on a whopping final score of +37.88, despite a winnerless Friday. He held off bacciodilupo (+34.92), who somehow found Vroum Vroum Mag to close the gap slightly as they reached the line. Congratulations, Chris! We\u2019ll be in touch. As Monday is a bank holiday, we\u2019ll hold over the start of our new week\u2019s competition until Tuesday. Do please use the comments section to share any tips you may have for Monday\u2019s racing!",

My aim is to help as many children as possible to enjoy science, and so I launched Whizz Pop Bang \u2013 a gender-neutral kids\u2019 magazine that makes science fun and engaging. </p> <p>With no funding capital of my own, I wore my ethos on my sleeve and took to crowd-funding platform, Kickstarter, to raise the\u00a310,000 I needed. After a hugely successful campaign, Whizz Pop Bang rocketed into print in August 2015. </p> <p>I was keen to avoid the pink/blue sea of plastic on the kids\u2019 magazine supermarket shelves, so my magazines are only available by subscription, which meant I needed to spread the word. Offering UK primary schools a free annual subscription might sound like a crazy business strategy, but that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m determined that as many children as possible benefit from the magazines \u2013 and in return for their free subscription, I\u2019m asking schools to hand out Whizz Pop Bang leaflets to pupils. This has been a terrific and cost effective way to market my magazine, whilst also helping to engage tens of thousands more children with science. </p> <p>The magazine has grown to over 5000 subscribers in six short months, but without doubt the greatest achievement is all of the heart-warming feedback from parents, teachers and children. That warm, fuzzy feeling of encouraging more kids to have fun with science is what Whizz Pop Bang is all about.<br /></p> </blockquote> <p><em>All entries which meet the competition criteria are published and our judging panel select a shortlist of the top three for each category.

My aim is to help as many children as possible to enjoy science, and so I launched Whizz Pop Bang \u2013 a gender-neutral kids\u2019 magazine that makes science fun and engaging. With no funding capital of my own, I wore my ethos on my sleeve and took to crowd-funding platform, Kickstarter, to raise the\u00a310,000 I needed. After a hugely successful campaign, Whizz Pop Bang rocketed into print in August 2015. I was keen to avoid the pink/blue sea of plastic on the kids\u2019 magazine supermarket shelves, so my magazines are only available by subscription, which meant I needed to spread the word. Offering UK primary schools a free annual subscription might sound like a crazy business strategy, but that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m determined that as many children as possible benefit from the magazines \u2013 and in return for their free subscription, I\u2019m asking schools to hand out Whizz Pop Bang leaflets to pupils. This has been a terrific and cost effective way to market my magazine, whilst also helping to engage tens of thousands more children with science. The magazine has grown to over 5000 subscribers in six short months, but without doubt the greatest achievement is all of the heart-warming feedback from parents, teachers and children. That warm, fuzzy feeling of encouraging more kids to have fun with science is what Whizz Pop Bang is all about. All entries which meet the competition criteria are published and our judging panel select a shortlist of the top three for each category. Winners are announced at an awards ceremony in summer 2016.",

      "bodyText": "There is an undercurrent in the frayed relationship between Conor McGregor and the UFC that highlights the reality of the mixed martial arts business. Currently, fighters are hired as independent contractors yet appear to be treated like employees without the benefits of such an arrangement. US congressman Markwayne Mullin, himself a former professional mixed martial artist, intends to sponsor a piece of legislation that aims to shift the landscape of MMA by providing fighters such as McGregor with increased safeguards and control of their careers. Five years from now, Mullin envisions all combat sports athletes fighting while enjoying far greater prospects of financial stability. \u201cIt\u2019s not to focus on bringing down the UFC,\u201d said Mullin, a conservative Republican from rural Oklahoma. \u201cI just want to make sure the athletes are valued the same as the league or promotion, or whatever you want to call the UFC at this point. Right now I feel the UFC treats their fighters not as an asset, but as a commodity. That mindset has to be changed. It\u2019s a professional sport with professional athletes in it. It takes both to be successful.\u201d Mullin\u2019s office has the majority of the legislation written, and remains focused on crafting final details that will be released in the coming weeks. The language could be made into law by amending the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act or as standalone legislation. Enacted in May 2000, the Ali Act sought to end what it described as the widespread abuse of boxers. The lack of a centralized organization or league and the failure of state regulators to enforce the protections of fighters unevenly were among several issues the Ali Act cited as problematic for boxers. Insufficient oversight of promoters, the lack of an independent ranking system or uniform contracts, and the need for enhanced financial disclosures also joined the list. While the Ali Act opened the business of boxing, paving the way for more lucrative contractual terms and freedoms for top boxers than those experienced by their MMA counterparts, enforcement by the Department of Justice has been criticized as toothless. Nonetheless, proponents believe a similar application of law to MMA would produce necessary upheaval in the way fighters and promoters operate, marking a huge shift from the sport\u2019s current hybrid boxing-pro wrestling model. There is strong support on both sides of the issue. For years the proprietors of the UFC have opposed federal regulation for MMA. Zuffa, the UFC\u2019s parent company, employs lobbyists in Washington to advocate that its league-like status combined with state regulation means its mixed martial artists does not need an \u201cAli Act.\u201d Representatives for the UFC visited Mullin\u2019s office on 15 April this year to express just that opinion. The UFC, according to Mullin, explained that their fighters are hired as subcontractors and treated as such. The congressman countered that if that was the case, UFC should have no problem with the potential legislation. Zuffa did not respond to a request for comment for this article. \u201cIf they\u2019re really subcontractors then the Ali Act is a framework to protect fighters if we want the sport to be successful,\u201d Mullin said. \u201cIf we want it to be sustainable and respectable we need to make sure and understand that we need to take care of the fighters and the organization. I want the organization to be successful too, but the fighters need to be taken care of. \u201cThey make the decision who fights and who doesn\u2019t fight. There\u2019s nobody that\u2019s controlling the ranking system except the inner workings of the UFC. I think a third body needs to be looking at that. Needs to control that.\u201d Mullin told UFC representatives that by limiting endorsement opportunities and securing fighters to long-term contracts that include extension options, they appear to be operating like a league instead of merely a fight promoter. Employment status affects many issues such as benefits, tax implications, and liability. In team sports, athletes are generally defined as employees. In individual sports, like boxing, they\u2019re paid as independent contractors. The UFC-fighter arrangement is a unique concoction of contractor and employee. Among the key distinctions: employees work regularly with one company while contractors can provide services for various entities. UFC contracts address this via exclusivity clauses that lock in fighters to the promotion. The UFC provides a form of health insurance outside of competition, a rarity for contractors, yet fighters are expected to cover their own expenses for training among other costs. Bellator MMA, a property of Viacom and a competitor to the UFC, has said it welcomes an Ali Act to open the sport, and the promotion\u2019s president, Scott Coker, reiterated his support last week. Competitors to the UFC see an opportunity for the world\u2019s best fighters, many of whom are exclusive to the octagon, to become accessible. The movement to establish this kind of MMA commerce has been explored in various forms, including opened-and-closed FTC investigations and ongoing antitrust lawsuits that are in the discovery phase. Discussion in the media regarding fighter rights generally focuses on the athletes organizing and establishing their own protections. Yet this argument fails to recognize that contractors are unable to unionize according to federal law. Rather than unionizing, contractors can form an association, and there has been an ongoing effort towards that goal for several years. When representatives from the budding fighters\u2019 association visited Mullin to explain what they hoped to accomplish by folding MMA under the Ali Act, he was overjoyed. \u201cI said, \u2018Are you kidding? I\u2019ve been waiting three years for you guys to come to my office now let\u2019s go with it.\u2019 I\u2019m very familiar with it but we\u2019ll have to tweak some things,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had the same thought. They said let\u2019s include all combatants. I said I agree with that. Let\u2019s get it on the table all at once. They\u2019re gung-ho. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a tremendous amount of support from the business community and other fighters out there. The only one that\u2019s really been opposed to this has been the UFC itself. They came in and they said it wasn\u2019t going to do anything and wasn\u2019t going to make any difference. And I said, \u2018Then why are you guys in my office? If you\u2019re not concerned about it, if you think everything is perfect, you shouldn\u2019t be too concerned about it. But the truth is they know what\u2019s happening right now with the fighters.\u201d Mullin said from his experience, timing can be more important than policy when it comes to getting legislation across the finish line. It happens that \u201cthe timing and the policy are perfect on this,\u201d he said, and support from all sides, including labor unions, is welcome. The teamsters and other organized labor groups, including the NFL Players Association, have voiced support for the fighters association. \u201cI don\u2019t care where the support comes from,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all have a job to do. We also get to make a choice if we want to be part of the union or not part of the union. So if we\u2019re all working for the same goal, and that\u2019s to make sure the league and the fighters are on an even playing field and the can benefit from something they\u2019re dedicating their lives to, let\u2019s move.\u201d Mullin will need a sponsor on the Senate side, and the former presidential candidate John McCain, architect of the Ali Act, said he would support amending the law to cover mixed martial artists. Despite political differences Mullin said he and McCain \u2014 notorious for calling MMA \u201chuman cockfighting\u201d (although he has since become more amenable) \u2014 have worked on other pieces of legislation. \u201cTo see where his position has come. To see where the sport has moved to \u2014 being recognized as a true sport \u2014is great,\u201d Mullin said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a meeting with Senator McCain in the next week or so. Sit down and see if he has any interest in it. If not we\u2019ll move on to someone else. I had another senator reach out and express interest.\u201d Mullin declined to name the senator because they had not yet discussed the legislation in depth. Due to Mullin\u2019s experience as a professional fighter \u2014 sherdog.com lists him at 3-0, though he complains it\u2019s missing some wins \u2014 his concern about these issues began prior to his election to congress in 2012. The 38-year-old said he wanted to find a way to help fighters caught in \u201cthis cycle\u201d yet had to wait because his friends in UFC \u201cdidn\u2019t want to rock the boat\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m anti-regulation. I come from a business background. I can\u2019t stand it,\u201d Mullin said. \u201cBut when regulation is needed, that is the roll of the federal government.\u201d McGregor has made the crux of his fight with the UFC about contractually-obligated media duties. At the heart of his quarrel is who truly controls his career. Mullins\u2019 bill may not relieve McGregor from the distraction of media tours and commercials, but it could very well produce important changes that alter the power dynamic between MMA\u2019s biggest stars and their promoters.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt\u2019s only when you go back home that it really sinks in,\u201d Judy Murray says on a day of rare Scottish sunshine. On the outskirts of Edinburgh, the coach and former Federation Cup captain reflects on the fact her sons, Jamie and Andy, occupy the world No1 and No2 slots in, respectively, the men\u2019s doubles and singles rankings. Last week she and Jamie took the Davis Cup trophy, which the Murray brothers and Great Britain won amid high emotion six months ago, to their home town of Dunblane. Memories flooded through them. They also could not forget the terrible day 20 years ago when Jamie and Andy were at Dunblane primary school and 16 of their fellow pupils and a teacher were killed in a mass shooting. It seems incredible that, beyond such carnage and coming from a rainy Scottish town without any tennis history, such success followed for the Murray boys. \u201cWe speak about it very occasionally,\u201d Judy Murray says. \u201cBut, last Christmas, Andy said: \u2018You know, mum, it really is amazing what\u2019s happened.\u2019 They were home for Christmas and it was cold but Andy got up that morning and went for a run. He ran from the Bridge of Allan into Dunblane. He ran around Dunblane, going past the primary school, the high school, the post box, the cathedral where he got married and then back past the tennis courts. There was a family playing on the tennis court with two little boys. Andy went on to the court and had a hit with the kids. He had his beanie on and no one else knew he was there. \u201cAndy then went back up to my mum and dad\u2019s for breakfast. It was probably that run which brought it home to him. He was thinking that was our little club \u2013 with no track record of success. There was no one to learn from and that makes their success so special. It was just after they had won the Davis Cup, so these emotions were very vivid.\u201d Those same feelings ran deep again when Judy and Jamie returned to Dunblane with the Davis Cup which \u201cis like a giant wedding cake. It has to be brought in a van and it takes about 45 minutes to get it on and off the van. It was a great day. I\u2019d asked Jamie where he would most like to go and he said the primary and senior schools and then end up at the club. \u201cIt was emotional for me and lovely to see Jamie being recognised. For so long he has been in the shadow of Andy and so it was great to see him being the centre of attention. And anytime I go back to the tennis club I feel the most emotion. Apart from a lick of paint the club looks exactly as it was when they were small boys. I can see them running around while I was coaching. I remember them playing in the men\u2019s third team when they were quite little.\u201d There is much more than nostalgia at work here. Murray has only recently stepped down from her Federation Cup duties, and is preparing to have one last tilt at securing permission to build a Scottish tennis centre just outside Dunblane. Fizzing with ideas and ventures like Miss Hits, encouraging young girls to play the game, and Tennis on the Road, which focuses on developing interest in deprived or remote areas of Scotland, Murray is also determined. \u201cMy main goal is to grow the game in Scotland. I did it before and we started with one small indoor centre with four courts and out of that we got four Davis Cup and Federation Cup players, and grand slam winners, and very good coaches. We can do the same again \u2013 starting small and growing from there. I am not desperate to produce another Andy. I couldn\u2019t do that again but hopefully I can produce a workforce that can go on to do that. I want to be up here in Scotland so I can make sure there is a legacy for what Jamie and Andy have achieved.\u201d The past and the future are so entwined in Murray\u2019s vision that, for all the pain such questions evoke, it seems important to ask her about the tragic day of 13 March 1996. It is not a subject Murray finds easy to revisit, and there are signs of distress on her face and in her voice as she talks about her raw memories. She knew Thomas Hamilton, the gunman who killed himself after taking 17 lives, and had given him occasional lifts in her car. Murray also knew most of the mothers who lost their children. While they were waiting in a school room for the police to tell them what had happened there was such little space that Murray shared a chair with a woman who had been a fellow pupil at her school when they were girls. The other woman rose from their chair when she heard it was her daughter\u2019s class which had been attacked. \u201cYou never imagine something like that would happen in your little town,\u201d Murray says softly. \u201cThat was very hard. Your immediate reaction when you realise it\u2019s not your child\u2019s class is relief and then there is enormous guilt because people you know are about to suffer. It\u2019s their child\u2019s class. You never forget that moment.\u201d Murray pauses, and shakes her head. \u201cYou never forget what you could have lost that day and it makes you appreciate what you have. It\u2019s 20 years ago and the town has recovered. No one ever forgets but the boys\u2019 success has given Dunblane a lot of pride. For me it\u2019s always a reminder of how fortunate we are and how important it is that the boys remain grounded and hard-working. It\u2019s their way of saying: \u2018This is where we are from, this is who we are \u2026\u2019\u201d They were coached initially by her and their variety of play and tactical acumen are rooted in her approach but a point came where a mother from Dunblane, without much support from the LTA, could take them no further. She had become the leading coach in Scotland but her sons needed to travel abroad. Andy was still a teenager when the first move had to be made. \u201cAs Scotland national coach my starting salary was \u00a325,000,\u201d she remembers. \u201cWhen Andy had the chance to train in Spain we had to find a way. We got a little money from the LTA and Tennis Scotland but we needed \u00a335,000 a year for Andy to have a decent run at it.\u201d Murray had to apply for a \u00a330,000 loan and her eyes widen. \u201cIt was a big risk. I didn\u2019t realise what we were getting into but I knew this was the next step he had to take. A year later Jamie [15 months older than Andy] finished school and wanted to go to France because they have faster surfaces. So there was huge financial stress for about three years. I can talk about it now but back then it was hard. I\u2019m not sure parents understand how horrendously expensive it is \u2013 and there are no guarantees. For most kids professional tennis just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d Murray also faced the difficult task of sitting down with her eldest son in 2006 to tell him a brutal truth. \u201cI had to tell Jamie it was not going to happen for him in singles. At least I could also tell him his skills were suited to doubles.\u201d That summer, Murray dug deep into her plundered savings to entice a doubles specialist coach, Louis Cayer, to work with Jamie. \u201cI took Louis on for six weeks because it was all I could afford but he is responsible for setting Jamie in the right direction. \u201cI\u2019ve watched Jamie get better and better. He needed a settled partner in John Peers and they made two slam finals last year [before Murray switched partners and, at the Australian Open this year, won his first men\u2019s doubles grand slam with Bruno Soares]. Success helps confidence but Jamie invested in himself. You can keep plodding at 40 in the world but, in doubles, you won\u2019t make much impact. Your income is small if you\u2019re not winning the big tournaments. But Jamie paid Louis to join him on the road \u2013 not every week \u2013 because he wanted to improve. He also started working with a sports psychologist to manage his emotions better. The investment in himself has paid off.\u201d Andy, meanwhile, made yet another grand slam final in Australia, losing to Novak Djokovic, and became a father for the first time in February. He suffered a dip in form before reaching the semi-finals in Monaco, where he lost to a resurgent Rafael Nadal. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge change in his life, becoming a dad, but Andy\u2019s gone through various spells when his results have not been quite what he wanted. He started to play well again in Monte Carlo. Let\u2019s see what he can do this week in Madrid. When you have a change like fatherhood it\u2019s understandable you might get a bit distracted but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s temporary.\u201d Murray has stepped down from the Federation Cup captaincy because its unwieldy structure means that, until Britain get into the World Group, they play matches only every February. The absence of Johanna Konta and Laura Robson this year cost them the promotion place that Murray had pursued for so long. Yet she has a broader regret. \u201cI was always going to step down this year but there is a larger issue. There are not enough girls coming into tennis and I believe team competition engages fans more powerfully. I hope we can persuade the ITF to let the women have a similar format to the Davis Cup. We need to grow the women\u2019s game. At WTA events, in the early stages, the stands are empty so we need to do something to get more people watching.\u201d At least British women\u2019s tennis has a fresh presence in the impressive Konta who has risen from No150 in the world to a grand slam semi-final in Australia this year. \u201cIn the past, during the Fed Cup, she would get very anxious during the tight points but so much changed when she took on a new coach in Esteban Carril \u2013 a very calm Spanish guy. He added real calm, a big serve and taught her how to defend. She no longer panics and tries to hit herself out of trouble. Jo\u2019s on the verge of the top 20 \u2013 and she senses anything is possible.\u201d Similar belief pulses through the 56-year-old Murray. She has overcome her disappointment that plans for a Scottish tennis centre \u201cwere knocked back at local level but we have appealed to the Scottish government. I see it as the catalyst for Scottish tennis. \u201cWe need to capitalise on Jamie and Andy\u2019s success \u2013 and going back to Dunblane made me realise there\u2019s a huge appetite for tennis in Scotland. That\u2019s down to the boys but they won\u2019t play for ever and Scotland won\u2019t get another chance like this again. We have to take it. I want to secure that legacy for Scottish tennis.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Labor\u2019s ability to fund its multi-billion dollar election promises has been thrown into doubt by treasury officials, on the evening before the Turnbull government delivers its first budget. Labor last year announced plans to raise $47.7bn over 10 years by increasing the tobacco excise dramatically, and using that money to pay for $70bn worth of spending plans. It says if elected it would increase the tobacco excise by 12.5% a year, between now and 2020, plus twice-yearly indexation, and that that would raise $3.8bn over four years, and $47.7bn over the decade. The revenue-raising plan was designed to be an alternative to the Turnbull government\u2019s proposal to raise revenue by increasing the GST. Under current policy, a pack of 25 cigarettes costs about $24.69 today and will cost $29.91 in 2020. Under Labor\u2019s proposed policy, it would cost $40.80 in 2020. But organisations like the Grattan Institute have criticised the plan, warning it will lock in higher spending and make the structural budget deficit worse because fewer people are smoking. Now a leaked document from the Turnbull government\u2019s first budget \u2013 to be released on Tuesday \u2013 shows Labor\u2019s plan would raise billions of dollars less than it thinks. The treasury figures, seen by Guardian Australia, show Labor\u2019s plan will only raise $28.2bn over 10 years \u2013 a massive $19.5bn less than expected. That will put huge pressure on Labor\u2019s $70bn spending plans, because Labor has been relying on the dramatically-higher tobacco excise to fund more than half of them. The revelation is being used by the Coalition to reinvigorate its attack on Labor as a high-spending, high-taxing party that has trouble controlling the budget. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, told parliament on Monday \u2013 without referring to the budget document \u2013 that Labor would not be able to pay for its planned increase in education funding by relying on the tobacco excise. He said the Coalition\u2019s school funding plan was more sensible that Labor\u2019s. \u201cWe have been spending more and more on education but the outcomes have not been improving,\u201d Turnbull said on Monday. \u201cNow, the answer to that is ensuring that the taxpayers\u2019 dollars, the parents\u2019 dollars, are better deployed so that we get the better outcomes.\u201d The shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, in February said Labor\u2019s tobacco excise tax projections were \u201crock solid\u201d because they had been costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the budget leak was a \u201cdesperate attempt to cover for the fact the Government will be adopting, in full, Labor\u2019s policy on tobacco excise.\u201d \u201cLabor\u2019s tobacco excise policy was fully and independently costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office.\u201d \u201cLabor has never directly hypothecated the revenue from tobacco excise for schools spending. It\u2019s just one of the savings proposal that Labor in opposition has outlined and there will be more to come,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Love him or loathe him Chris Packham is a hard man to ignore. Recently returned from Malta, where he has been for a second time to highlight the massacre of thousands of birds on migration by Maltese hunters, he came up with the hash tag #wheredovesdie in tribute to the late singer Prince. The idea was to draw attention to the plight of the declining turtle dove. In 2014 he was intimidated by hunters and then threatened with arrest for his efforts. This time he has been accused of being an \u201cunethical fake and a liar\u201d by the hunters\u2019 federation chief executive Lino Farrugia and declared a persona non grata on the island. Now 54, Packham has just published his autobiography, Fingers in the Sparkle Jar. In it he reveals for the first time that he has Asperger syndrome, a form of autism, and twice contemplated suicide following the death of his former dog Fish, but was saved by his current two dogs, Itchy and Scratchy. It tells the story of an introverted and at times angry young man whose love affair with nature was a way of surviving the alienation he encountered among his peers growing up in 1970s suburban Southampton. The book details Packham\u2019s finding solace in a young kestrel and is a beautiful, riveting and disturbing read with many echoes of the social rejection personified in the film Kes by the Ken Loach. His love of nature resulted in him going on to study zoology at Southampton University, after which he trained to be a wildlife cameraman \u2013 leading to his job on The Really Wild Show, and before taking over the anchor role on Springwatch from Bill Oddie. I first met Chris on the Really Wild Show in 1988 as a researcher and we have kept in touch ever since. Over the years since then he has rarely been out of the headlines and has been credited in the media with waging war on everything from pandas to insect-eating celebrities. He maintains he doesn\u2019t seek controversy for the sake of it but that sometimes it is necessary to make people wake up to what is happening to the natural world. In his lifetime half the world\u2019s wildlife has disappeared and although there are some bright spots that decline looks set to continue unabated over the next 50 years. When it comes to getting people\u2019s attention Packham has that rare quality of being able to cause controversy and yet seemingly emerge with his popularity enhanced. Following a recent Guardian interview some people were quietly horrified when he admitted smearing jam on the face of his five-year-old step-daughter Megan so wasps could lick it off and she \u201cwouldn\u2019t be afraid of them\u201d. Many others praised the merit of this \u201ctough love\u201d. Similarly when the Countryside Alliance called for him to be sacked last year following a controversial article he wrote about hunting in BBC Wildlife magazine many people rallied to his defence. Away filming at the time, he returned to find himself at the centre of a media storm. When it eventually died down, far from getting sacked, the whole affair simply reinforced how popular he was with over 70,000 people signing a petition urging the BBC to keep him. What I admire most about Packham is that unlike many other celebrities he is willing to use his celebrity to court controversy for the sake of a good cause and put his money where his mouth is. He works tirelessly for a host of organisations from the RSPB to Population Matters, in the process helping to highlight many causes from the persecution of England\u2019s dwindling hen harrier population to the decline in our biodiversity caused by overpopulation. The reason Packham seems to divide opinion so starkly is precisely because he is passionate, speaks his mind and is willing to stand up for what he believes in. In the pressured and unforgiving world of television those are rare qualities.",

Many others praised the merit of this <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/fatherhood/the-merits-of-tough-love-why-chris-packham-was-right-to-subject/\" title=\"\">\u201ctough love\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Similarly when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/07/countryside-alliance-bbc-sack-chris-packham\" title=\"\">Countryside Alliance called for him to be sacked</a> last year following a controversial article he wrote about hunting in BBC Wildlife magazine many people rallied to his defence. Away filming at the time, he returned to find himself at the centre of a media storm. When it eventually died down, far from getting sacked, the whole affair simply reinforced how popular he was with over <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/chris-packham-thanks-fans-after-70000-people-sign-petition-urging-bbc-not-to-sack-him-following-10501470.html\" title=\"\">70,000 people signing a petition</a> urging the BBC to keep him.</p> <p>What I admire most about Packham is that unlike many other celebrities he is willing to use his celebrity to court controversy for the sake of a good cause and put his money where his mouth is. He works tirelessly for a host of organisations from the RSPB to Population Matters, in the process helping to highlight many causes from the persecution of England\u2019s dwindling hen harrier population to the decline in our biodiversity caused by overpopulation.</p> <p>The reason Packham seems to divide opinion so starkly is precisely because he is passionate, speaks his mind and is willing to stand up for what he believes in. In the pressured and unforgiving world of television those are rare qualities.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Second refugee at Australian detention centre in Nauru sets herself on fire", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A young refugee woman from Somalia has set herself alight at an Australian detention centre on Nauru, just days after a 23-year-old man, Omid, died of injuries sustained in a similar act. It comes amid moves by the Australian immigration department to shift detainees out to other mainland facilities, a worsening mental health crisis in the offshore processing centres, and the sudden partial collapse of Australia\u2019s offshore processing policy. Omid\u2019s widow on Monday told Guardian Australia that she is being kept in a Brisbane hotel by immigration authorities, denied access to a lawyer and sedated. The name of the young woman who self-immolated on Monday is Hadon, sometimes also written as Hodan, and she is 21. Her suicide attempt on Monday afternoon, at OPC1 in the Nauru detention centre, has been confirmed by senior department staff. According to several sources on the island, she is severely burned, and is currently in the Nauruan hospital. An Australian medical team specialising in trauma treatment is reportedly on the island and treating the woman. \u201cOne of the witness who saw her said the situation is much worse than Omid,\u201d said the source. Other refugees have been stopped from entering the hospital, but expressed concern that she be medically evacuated out soon after accusations of delays in treating Omid. A Careflight medical jet left Townsville shortly after 8.30pm bound for the Solomon Islands capital of Honiara, which the flights to Nauru must stop at first. However, Guardian Australia could not confirm this was definitely sent for Hodan. Hadon is one of three detainees returned to Nauru last week after receiving medical care in Australia for injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident late last year. Last Tuesday morning she was forcibly removed by Border Force officers from the Brisbane Immigration Transit Accommodation. The government of Nauru said it was \u201cdistressed that refugees are attempting such dreadful acts in order to attempt to influence the Australian Government\u2019s immigration policies.\u201d The past week has seen significant changes and events within Australia\u2019s immigration regime. Current Australian government policy \u2013 with bipartisan support \u2013 states that no asylum seeker who attempts to arrive by boat will ever settle in the country. Instead they are sent to the two offshore processing facilities on Manus Island, in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and on Nauru. There they are processed and either repatriated or resettled in a third country. However after the PNG supreme court ruled the detention illegal, and its government announced closure of the Manus Island facility, the Australian government has scrambled for a solution . Detainees in both centres have become increasingly distressed amid the confusion. On Monday, authorities began a sudden transfer of detainees from a mainland detention centre in Darwin to other mainland facilities. Detainees, believed to be from both the family and single men\u2019s compounds, were told to report to appointments with immigration on Monday morning. There, at least some were told they would be transferred to other mainland detention centres in the next few days. Detainees were given a luggage limit of one 20kg bag each for their possessions, and were to be transferred by charter flight. As well as housing a number of long-term detainees, Wickham Point is also used as a transfer facility between mainland and offshore centres, and as detention for people brought from offshore facilities to receive Australian medical treatment. The department of immigration did not respond to questions on the Wickham Point transfer. Catherine Stubberfield, spokesperson for UNHCR\u2019s Regional Representation in Canberra, said there was \u201cno doubt that the current policy of offshore processing and prolonged detention is immensely harmful\u201d. \u201cThere are approximately 2000 very vulnerable refugees and asylum-seekers on Manus Island and Nauru. These people have already been through a great deal, many have fled war and persecution, some have already suffered trauma. Despite commendable efforts by the Governments of Papua New Guinea and Nauru, arrangements in both countries have proved completely untenable. Stubberfield said the mental health and physical wellbeing of people held in detention had deteriorated over time. \u201cThe consensus among medical experts is that conditions of detention and offshore processing do immense damage to physical and mental health. UNHCR\u2019s principal concern today is that these refugees and asylum-seekers are immediately moved to humane conditions with adequate support and services to prevent further unnecessary suffering.\u201d The UNHCR conducts regular monitoring visits to offshore detention sites, including seven visits to Nauru since it was re-opened in 2012. UNHCR staff were present when Omid set himself alight last Wednesday, though he had not been interviewed by the UNHCR or doctors accompanying the mission. Stubberfield said UNHCR staff were deeply saddened by Omid\u2019s death. Save the Children\u2019s chief executive Paul Ronalds said Australia needed to find permanent, and workable solutions, for those held on Nauru and Manus, who were being damaged by the ongoing uncertainty over their futures. \u201cWe know first-hand from our time on Nauru that prolonged and indefinite detention, and the uncertainty associated with a lack of permanent resettlement options for refugees on Nauru, causes serious harm. Recent events on both Manus and Nauru demonstrate the unsustainability of present arrangements, and that further serious and life threatening incidents are inevitable.\u201d Greens senator, Sarah Hanson-Young, called for the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to intervene. \u201cI refuse to accept that this is the best we can do. There are not just the two options of dangerous boat journeys or people burning themselves to death,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a better way, where we process people\u2019s claims for asylum where they are and then bring them to Australia safely.\u201d",

An Australian medical team specialising in trauma treatment is reportedly on the island and treating the woman.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the witness who saw her said the situation is much worse than Omid,\u201d said the source. Other refugees have been stopped from entering the hospital, but expressed concern that she be medically evacuated out soon after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/29/wife-of-man-who-died-after-setting-fire-to-himself-in-nauru-slams-delay-in-care\">accusations of delays in treating Omid.</a></p> <p>A Careflight medical jet left Townsville shortly after 8.30pm bound for the Solomon Islands capital of Honiara, which the flights to Nauru must stop at first.

Instead they are sent to the two offshore processing facilities on Manus Island, in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and on Nauru. There they are processed and either repatriated or resettled in a third country.</p> <p>However after the PNG <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/26/papua-new-guinea-court-rules-detention-asylum-seekers-manus-unconstitutional\">supreme court ruled</a> the detention illegal, and its government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/27/manus-island-detention-centre-to-close-papua-new-guinea-prime-minister-says\">announced closure of the Manus Island facility</a>, the Australian government has scrambled for a solution . Detainees in both centres have become increasingly distressed amid the confusion.</p> <p>On Monday, authorities began a sudden transfer of detainees from a mainland detention centre in Darwin to other mainland facilities.</p> <p>Detainees, believed to be from both the family and single men\u2019s compounds, were told to report to appointments with immigration on Monday morning. There, at least some were told they would be transferred to other mainland detention centres in the next few days.</p> <p>Detainees were given a luggage limit of one 20kg bag each for their possessions, and were to be transferred by charter flight. As well as housing a number of long-term detainees, Wickham Point is also used as a transfer facility between mainland and offshore centres, and as detention for people brought from offshore facilities to receive Australian medical treatment.</p> <p>The department of immigration did not respond to questions on the Wickham Point transfer. </p> <p>Catherine Stubberfield, spokesperson for UNHCR\u2019s Regional Representation in Canberra, said there was \u201cno doubt that the current policy of offshore processing and prolonged detention is immensely harmful\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere are approximately 2000 very vulnerable refugees and asylum-seekers on Manus Island and Nauru. These people have already been through a great deal, many have fled war and persecution, some have already suffered trauma. Despite commendable efforts by the Governments of Papua New Guinea and Nauru, arrangements in both countries have proved completely untenable.<br /></p> <p>Stubberfield said the mental health and physical wellbeing of people held in detention had deteriorated over time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/29/wife-of-man-who-died-after-setting-fire-to-himself-in-nauru-slams-delay-in-care\">Wife of man who died after setting fire to himself in Nauru slams delay in care</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe consensus among medical experts is that conditions of detention and offshore processing do immense damage to physical and mental health. UNHCR\u2019s principal concern today is that these refugees and asylum-seekers are immediately moved to humane conditions with adequate support and services to prevent further unnecessary suffering.\u201d</p> <p>The UNHCR conducts regular monitoring visits to offshore detention sites, including seven visits to Nauru since it was re-opened in 2012. UNHCR staff were present when Omid set himself alight last Wednesday, though he had not been interviewed by the UNHCR or doctors accompanying the mission.</p> <p>Stubberfield said UNHCR staff were deeply saddened by Omid\u2019s death.</p> <p>Save the Children\u2019s chief executive Paul Ronalds said Australia needed to find permanent, and workable solutions, for those held on Nauru and Manus, who were being damaged by the ongoing uncertainty over their futures.</p> <p>\u201cWe know first-hand from our time on Nauru that prolonged and indefinite detention, and the uncertainty associated with a lack of permanent resettlement options for refugees on Nauru, causes serious harm. Recent events on both Manus and Nauru demonstrate the unsustainability of present arrangements, and that further serious and life threatening incidents are inevitable.\u201d</p> <p>Greens senator, Sarah Hanson-Young, called for the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to intervene. </p> <p>\u201cI refuse to accept that this is the best we can do. There are not just the two options of dangerous boat journeys or people burning themselves to death,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a better way, where we process people\u2019s claims for asylum where they are and then bring them to Australia safely.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two Barbara Hepworth sculptures are to be sold by her old school in the hope they will raise more than \u00a31m. Hepworth left Wakefield Girls high school aged 17 in 1920 . The school acquired two of her works, the first was chosen by Hepworth herself in 1959, and the second was commissioned in 1973, for a headteacher with whom she had become friends. Both are owned by the school and tell a story of how important education and encouragement by teachers were to a woman considered one of the greatest British artists of the last century.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The winners Jacksonville Jaguars The Jags secured their place in this category the moment they selected Myles Jack in the second round. Plenty of analysts had predicted that they could take the linebacker with the fifth overall pick, even after it emerged that he may require microfracture surgery in the future. We should not underestimate the injury to Jack\u2019s right knee. He tore his lateral meniscus in September, and he has conceded that aspects of the injury are degenerative. His NFL career might well be shorter than it would have been otherwise. But the upside here is enormous. Jack says that he is fully healthy as of today and ready to jump in right away. Together with first-round pick Jalen Ramsey, his selection means that the Jags have added the two most talented defensive players in the entire draft. They did not do too badly in the later rounds, either, adding several useful bodies to their pass rushing rotation and finding more excellent value in fourth-round pick Sheldon Day \u2013 a penetrative defensive tackle who makes up for his small frame with quickness off the snap. Six out of seven picks were spent on defense, and you can imagine most of them contributing in 2016. Denver Broncos Paxton Lynch might not be ready to start immediately in the NFL. We should still expect to see Mark Sanchez behind center when Denver kick off the new season against Carolina on 9 September. But as a long-term bet, he feels like a far better option than Colin Kaepernick or Sam Bradford. Perhaps a cheaper one, too. The Broncos gave up only a third-round pick to swap places with Seattle in the first \u2013 less than they were reportedly offering when they first started negotiations with teams as high up as Atlanta at No17. Denver made a few other nice picks, too. Devontae Booker is a powerful one-cut runner who suits Gary Kubiak\u2019s schemes and could have gone much sooner. But in the end, the Broncos\u2019 draft really does come down to that first pick. They needed a quarterback desperately after Peyton Manning and Brock Osweiler both departed, and they got the one that they wanted. Seattle Seahawks Despite trading down with Denver, the Seahawks still got the player I thought they would take in the first round anyway \u2013 offensive tackle Germain Ifredi \u2013 and then grabbed defensive tackle Jarran Reed, whom I had going at No19, in the second round. The latter is an excellent run stuffer who looks like a natural choice to replace Brandon Mebane. Moritz Boehringer The story goes that Boehringer only took up football five years ago after stumbling across a YouTube video of Adrian Peterson. How many Vikings fans spent yesterday evening on the same platform, searching for footage of Boehringer, after their team selected him in the sixth round? He is the first player ever drafted directly from a European league, having played last season for the Schw\u00e4bisch Hall Unicorns in Germany. At 22 years old, he certainly has the raw tools\u2013- standing 6ft 4ins, 227lbs and running the 40-yard dash in 4.43. As NFL.com noted, the numbers he put up in a variety of drills during his pro day would have placed him among the top five receivers at the Scouting Combine. Whether or not this translates to a successful NFL career is uncertain. But what we can say is that Boehringer had a dream come true on draft day. Five years after an idle click led him to that video of Peterson, he will now get a chance to play on the running back\u2019s team. Jacoby Brissett Tom Brady has another four years on his contract in New England. Jimmy Garoppolo has just two. If Brady\u2019s four-game suspension holds, and Garoppolo does a passable job of filling in for him during that stretch, then how hard is it to imagine the Pats cashing in on the backup at the end of this season, just as they did with Matt Cassel in 2009? That would leave Brissett as Brady\u2019s heir apparent, with three years to prepare himself for a potential succession. I can think of worse places for mid-round signal callers to land. Cleveland Browns Few teams had more holes to fill in this draft than Cleveland, but the Browns recognised that fact and acted accordingly. Five trades in the space of three days granted them the opportunity to make a whopping 14 picks - equalling the record for most-ever in a seven-round draft. Not all of those were spent well, but Corey Coleman has the explosiveness to become a big-time playmaker at wide receiver whilst both Emmanuel Ogbah and Carl Nassib showed they could rush the quarterback in college. Most of all, however, the Browns deserve extra credit for recognising that this roster rebuild will need to be a marathon, not a sprint. They landed an additional first-round pick for 2017 from the Eagles, and an additional second-rounder from Tennessee, setting themselves up to continue to grow. Losers Johnny Manziel Oh Johnny. Atlanta Falcons I had a hard time picking out teams whose drafts I really hated this year. Perhaps this was just a deep class, but for almost every team I could find a handful of picks that felt like a solid value. The Falcons were the one exception, reaching for Keanu Neal \u2013 widely regarded as a second-round talent \u2013 at No17 and never really offsetting that with any excellent picks thereafter. There was at least a coherence to their choices, with Neal, Deion Jones and De\u2019Vondre Campbell all fitting the mould of athletic, versatile defenders that Dan Quinn prefers. It is quite possible that he will get the most out of them in ways that another coach would not, and they do arrive in positions of need at safety and linebacker. Individually, though, none of Atlanta\u2019s picks excite me. And I do wonder whether they should have done something to address weaknesses on the defensive line. Laremy Tunsil What a weird story this was. To recap: minutes before the draft was about to start, a video was posted on Laremy Tunsil\u2019s Twitter account, showing him smoking from a bong attached to a gas mask. The tweet, and the account, were soon deleted, but the damage was done. Tunsil had widely been forecast as the first offensive tackle to be selected, most likely in the top six picks, but instead fell to Miami at No13. Then, after he was chosen, a further post appeared on his Instagram account, showing a series of texts in which he appeared to ask a University of Mississippi employee for help paying his mother\u2019s electricity and water bills. Under NCAA regulations, any such payment to a player or their family is prohibited. One could argue very cogently that these were not grievous transgressions. Lots of people smoke weed at university, and - shock, horror! - so do plenty of NFL players. You will have no disagreement from me on the suggestion that athletes earning millions of dollars for their universities should also be entitled to proper compensation. For more on this subject, I would counsel anyone to check out 2013 documentary Schooled - The Price of College Sports. But none of this changes the fact that Tunsil was a loser on draft day, in the most literal sense. Falling to No13 cost him millions of dollars, although perhaps even here he should consider himself fortunate. With several teams reportedly removing him from their boards altogether after the initial video was posted, he could easily have slid a lot further. Sam Bradford, Colin Kaepernick, Ryan Fitzpatrick All of the quarterbacks listed here are at an impasse with their current employers, whether it be over the money that they think they deserve or their role on the team. All had previously been able to use the Broncos for leverage, as Denver continued to cast about for quarterback help even after signing Sanchez. Now that the Super Bowl champs have added Lynch, that bargaining position has disappeared. Winning and losing all at once Tampa Bay Buccaneers I really liked the Bucs\u2019 first two picks. They needed cornerback help and got the second-best player at the position, Vernon Hargreaves, despite trading down. Noah Spence is a fine edge rusher, so long as his off-field troubles are behind him. But then Tampa Bay gave up a third- and a fourth-round pick to move up and take a kicker in the second round. I appreciate that the position has become more important with extra points moving back and also that Roberto Aguayo is supposed to be special (though his numbers from beyond 40 yards in college don\u2019t look all that great). But with all the other players still on the board at No59, I\u2019m sorry, I just don\u2019t get it.",

Plenty of analysts had predicted that they could take the linebacker with the fifth overall pick, even after it emerged that <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/04/27/myles-jack-risks-millions-with-grim-confession-about-his-knee\">he may require microfracture surgery in the future</a>. </p> <p>We should not underestimate the injury to Jack\u2019s right knee. He tore his lateral meniscus in September, and he has conceded that aspects of the injury are degenerative. His NFL career might well be shorter than it would have been otherwise. But the upside here is enormous. Jack says that he is fully healthy as of today and ready to jump in right away. Together with first-round pick Jalen Ramsey, his selection means that the Jags have added the two most talented defensive players in the entire draft.</p> <p>They did not do too badly in the later rounds, either, adding several useful bodies to their pass rushing rotation and finding more excellent value in fourth-round pick Sheldon Day \u2013 a penetrative defensive tackle who makes up for his small frame with quickness off the snap. Six out of seven picks were spent on defense, and you can imagine most of them contributing in 2016. </p> <p><strong>Denver Broncos </strong>Paxton Lynch might not be ready to start immediately in the NFL. We should still expect to see Mark Sanchez behind center when Denver kick off the new season against Carolina on 9 September. But as a long-term bet, he feels like a far better option than Colin Kaepernick or Sam Bradford.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc97c74745739f194d72f8bb9344b15c7c0c6707\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc97c74745739f194d72f8bb9344b15c7c0c6707/0_7_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paxton Lynch is a good long-term option for the Broncos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paxton Lynch is a good long-term option for the Broncos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Zalubowski/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps a cheaper one, too. The Broncos gave up only a third-round pick to swap places with Seattle in the first \u2013 less than they were reportedly offering when they first started negotiations with teams as high up as Atlanta at No17. </p> <p>Denver made a few other nice picks, too. Devontae Booker is a powerful one-cut runner who suits Gary Kubiak\u2019s schemes and could have gone much sooner. But in the end, the Broncos\u2019 draft really does come down to that first pick. They needed a quarterback desperately after Peyton Manning and Brock Osweiler both departed, and they got the one that they wanted. </p> <p><strong>Seattle Seahawks </strong>Despite trading down with Denver, the Seahawks still got the player <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/27/nfl-mock-draft-2016-rams-goff-eagles-wentz\">I thought they would take in the first round anyway</a> \u2013 offensive tackle Germain Ifredi \u2013 and then grabbed defensive tackle Jarran Reed, whom I had going at No19, in the second round. The latter is an excellent run stuffer who looks like a natural choice to replace Brandon Mebane.</p> <p><strong>Moritz Boehringer </strong>The story goes that Boehringer only took up football five years ago after stumbling across a YouTube video of Adrian Peterson. How many Vikings fans spent yesterday evening on the same platform, searching for footage of Boehringer, after their team selected him in the sixth round?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEQ2_RDGqNM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EEQ2_RDGqNM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>He is the first player ever drafted directly from a European league, having played last season for the Schw\u00e4bisch Hall Unicorns in Germany. At 22 years old, he certainly has the raw tools\u2013- standing 6ft 4ins, 227lbs and running the 40-yard dash in 4.43. As NFL.com noted, the numbers he put up in a variety of drills during his pro day <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000649267/article/incredible-pro-day-puts-german-moritz-boehringer-on-nfl-radar\">would have placed him among the top five receivers</a> at the Scouting Combine. </p> <p>Whether or not this translates to a successful NFL career is uncertain. But what we can say is that Boehringer had a dream come true on draft day. Five years after an idle click led him to that video of Peterson, he will now get a chance to play on the running back\u2019s team. </p> <p><strong>Jacoby Brissett </strong>Tom Brady has another four years on his contract in New England. Jimmy Garoppolo has just two. If Brady\u2019s four-game suspension holds, and Garoppolo does a passable job of filling in for him during that stretch, then how hard is it to imagine the Pats cashing in on the backup at the end of this season, just as they did with Matt Cassel in 2009? That would leave Brissett as Brady\u2019s heir apparent, with three years to prepare himself for a potential succession. I can think of worse places for mid-round signal callers to land.</p> <p><strong>Cleveland Browns </strong>Few teams had more holes to fill in this draft than Cleveland, but the Browns recognised that fact and acted accordingly. Five trades in the space of three days granted them the opportunity to make a whopping 14 picks - equalling the record for most-ever in a seven-round draft. Not all of those were spent well, but Corey Coleman has the explosiveness to become a big-time playmaker at wide receiver whilst both Emmanuel Ogbah and Carl Nassib showed they could rush the quarterback in college.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2ce57c498b36ace05598189e882a9d2ca5cd5f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2ce57c498b36ace05598189e882a9d2ca5cd5f4/0_181_3126_1877/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corey Coleman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corey Coleman was selected by the Cleveland Browns as the No15 overall pick.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kamil Krzaczynski/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of all, however, the Browns deserve extra credit for recognising that this roster rebuild will need to be a marathon, not a sprint. They landed an additional first-round pick for 2017 from the Eagles, and an additional second-rounder from Tennessee, setting themselves up to continue to grow. </p> <h2><strong>Losers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Johnny Manziel </strong>Oh Johnny. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WillBurge/status/725856474895896576\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">2 yrs ago he was a 1st rd pick...now hes unemployed watching it at a bar in Columbus b4 the Bieber concert <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Manziel?src=hash\">#Manziel</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/phXU96jL3K\">pic.twitter.com/phXU96jL3K</a></p>&mdash; Will Burge (@WillBurge) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WillBurge/status/725856474895896576\">April 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Atlanta Falcons </strong>I had a hard time picking out teams whose drafts I really hated this year. Perhaps this was just a deep class, but for almost every team I could find a handful of picks that felt like a solid value. The Falcons were the one exception, reaching for Keanu Neal \u2013 widely regarded as a second-round talent \u2013 at No17 and never really offsetting that with any excellent picks thereafter.</p> <p>There was at least a coherence to their choices, with Neal, Deion Jones and De\u2019Vondre Campbell all fitting the mould of athletic, versatile defenders that Dan Quinn prefers. It is quite possible that he will get the most out of them in ways that another coach would not, and they do arrive in positions of need at safety and linebacker.</p> <p>Individually, though, none of Atlanta\u2019s picks excite me. And I do wonder whether they should have done something to address weaknesses on the defensive line. </p> <p><strong>Laremy Tunsil </strong>What a weird story this was. To recap: minutes before the draft was about to start, a video was posted on Laremy Tunsil\u2019s Twitter account, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/28/laremy-tunsil-gas-mask-tweet-nfl-draft-miami-dolphins\">showing him smoking from a bong attached to a gas mask</a>. The tweet, and the account, were soon deleted, but the damage was done. Tunsil had widely been forecast as the first offensive tackle to be selected, most likely in the top six picks, but instead fell to Miami at No13.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/28/laremy-tunsil-gas-mask-tweet-nfl-draft-miami-dolphins\">Laremy Tunsil's NFL draft unraveling was almost too outrageous to be true</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then, after he was chosen, a further post appeared on his Instagram account, showing a series of texts in which he appeared to ask a University of Mississippi employee for help paying his mother\u2019s electricity and water bills. Under NCAA regulations, any such payment to a player or their family is prohibited.</p> <p>One could argue very cogently that these were not grievous transgressions. Lots of people smoke weed at university, and - shock, horror! - <a href=\"http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/nfl/arrests-database/\">so do plenty of NFL players</a>. You will have no disagreement from me on the suggestion that athletes earning millions of dollars for their universities should also be entitled to proper compensation. For more on this subject, I would counsel anyone to check out 2013 documentary <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXfpybD-pig\">Schooled - The Price of College Sports</a>. </p> <p>But none of this changes the fact that Tunsil was a loser on draft day, in the most literal sense. Falling to No13 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/28/laremy-tunsil-gas-mask-tweet-nfl-draft-miami-dolphins\">cost him millions of dollars</a>, although perhaps even here he should consider himself fortunate. With several teams reportedly removing him from their boards altogether after the initial video was posted, he could easily have slid a lot further. </p> <p><strong>Sam Bradford, Colin Kaepernick, Ryan Fitzpatrick </strong>All of the quarterbacks listed here are at an impasse with their current employers, whether it be over the money that they think they deserve or their role on the team. All had previously been able to use the Broncos for leverage, as Denver continued to cast about for quarterback help even after signing Sanchez. Now that the Super Bowl champs have added Lynch, that bargaining position has disappeared.</p> <h2><strong>Winning and losing all at once</strong></h2> <p><strong>Tampa Bay Buccaneers </strong>I really liked the Bucs\u2019 first two picks. They needed cornerback help and got the second-best player at the position, Vernon Hargreaves, despite trading down. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/22/noah-spence-nfl-draft-desperate-chance\">Noah Spence</a> is a fine edge rusher, so long as his off-field troubles are behind him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/22/noah-spence-nfl-draft-desperate-chance\">NFL draft: Noah Spence desperate for a chance to show he's no dangerous risk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But then Tampa Bay gave up a third- and a fourth-round pick to move up and <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/draft2016/story/_/id/15430700/2016-nfl-draft-tampa-bay-buccaneers-pick-roberto-aguayo-florida-state-seminoles\">take a kicker in the second round</a>. I appreciate that the position has become more important with extra points moving back and also that Roberto Aguayo is supposed to be special (though his numbers from beyond 40 yards in college don\u2019t look all that great). But with all the other players still on the board at No59, I\u2019m sorry, I just don\u2019t get it. </p>",

      "bodyText": "In Minnesota, an administrative hearing resulted in a judicial recommendation that will have impacts across the country. It was a case argued mainly between environmental groups (such as Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, and their clients Fresh Energy and the Sierra Club) and energy producers (such as the now-bankrupt coal company Peabody Energy) regarding what a reasonable social cost of carbon should be. I was called as an expert witness in the case along with respected climate scientist Dr. Andrew Dessler. We were opposed by the well-known contrarians Drs. Roy Spencer, Richard Lindzen, and William Happer (who has recently received attention related to his charged fees in the case). In full disclosure, Dr. Dessler and I were not paid for our work in the case. I recently wrote about the testimony and provided links to the testimonies submitted for the case. The judge\u2019s recommendations and how they will impact energy decisions in the USA were the keys to this trial. On April 15th, the Administrative Law Judge decided that the estimated cost of carbon pollution currently used in Minnesota is too low. New knowledge about how fast the climate is changing, how much it will change, and how it will affect societies and economies would be reflected in a larger carbon cost. This leads to a large increase in the estimated cost, from $0.44-4.53 per ton to $11-57 per ton. A summary of the ruling can be found here and the full report is available here. How was this case won? Well certainly it helps to have science on your side. Without that, even the most expensive expert witnesses struggle. But Peabody\u2019s scientists made errors that were easy to identify and point out to the Judge. Furthermore, the Judge was smart, quickly able to see through nonsense non-science. For those of you that read the report, you\u2019ll notice that the Peabody side made claims about the natural variability of Earth\u2019s climate, about Earth temperature changes, and about extreme weather events. The environmental group\u2019s side rebutted these viewpoints (see pages 15-19). We also showed that the experts for Peabody relied extensively on non-peer-reviewed reports, blog sites, and think tanks to support their conclusions (paragraph 359 in the report). The peer-reviewed scientific literature is the best source for accurate climate science information. In other areas, the Peabody experts used scientific papers that we showed were incorrect (paragraph 360 in the report, for example). Perhaps the key findings are best articulated in the judicial conclusions, which begin on page 114. Among the conclusions are: 22. The Administrative Law Judge concludes that Peabody failed to demonstrate that an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 1 or 1.5\u00b0C is correct. 23. The Administrative Law Judge concludes that the climate sensitivity is reasonably considered to be in the 2-4.5\u00b0C range. 47. The Administrative Law Judge concludes that Peabody failed to demonstrate that the relied upon process is neither peer-reviewed nor transparent. I hope that this case will serve as a standard for other utility commissions as they work through the complex issues of the cost of carbon pollution. I also hope that the high standards of science used in Minnesota will be reflected in other areas where similar cases arise. You can\u2019t just bring in some contrarian scientists to make unsupported statements that minimize the costs of climate change. You have to bring in the best scientists and base your conclusions on high-quality peer reviewed studies.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The actions of President Joseph Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) make clear his intention to stay in power beyond his second term. But with the people set against it, and a strong and unambiguous two-term limit in the constitution, his ambitions are leading his country to a dangerous impasse. Since 2010, Kabila has deployed various tactics to delay the elections, hoping that this will allow him to stay on in a transitional arrangement. He has already achieved one of his goals: the timetable for presidential elections this year is no longer feasible. This is a hazardous strategy. Riots in January 2015 killed dozens of people. Since then, the government has locked up leaders of civil society movements fighting to protect the country\u2019s hard-won constitution. Given the scale of the organisational task and the lack of progress, the country will not be able to hold elections until well into next year. Presidents clinging to power can destabilise countries. In neighbouring Burundi, breaking a post-civil war promise not to extend a presidential mandate has quickly undermined the trust, social cohesion and political accord needed to avoid conflict. Congo-Brazzaville is plagued by unrest after President Sassou Nguesso changed the constitution and then went on to win a controversial election in March. Where governments remain highly centralised and institutions weak, the guarantee that power will change hands is vital to ensure that grievances are expressed peacefully. DRC suffers from overly centralised government and a patronage system in the hands of the incumbent. The deal that ended the civil war in 2002 shared the spoils of peace among former warring parties and other political hopefuls in the form of a government of national union, and then through a broad-based governing majority. The limit on presidential terms gave a guarantee that power would eventually be rotated, even if, at the time, short-term gains were at the forefront of most minds. Unless Kabila moves on, prominent and popular politicians, many his former allies, could be out in the cold for good. Facing a stubborn regime with less and less legitimacy, some may decide that violence is the only way to force change. Activists see term limits as a weathervane of democratic progress. Term limits are now in place across southern Africa, although in countries dominated by strong liberation parties, the presidency has passed to someone from within the ruling party: Tanzania, Namibia and Mozambique. In Nigeria, Zambia and Senegal, presidential ambitions to stay on have been thwarted by rival elites or strong institutions, such as parliament and civil society. The president of Niger\u2019s bid to cling to power was thwarted by his own army. Central Africa has a particularly bad record. Weak institutions and centralised power have handed incumbents a huge advantage, not only in winning elections, but also in changing constitutions. International partners, including some aid donors, have not voiced concern often enough, worried that too much democracy could upset fragile stability. Since the democratic advances of the early 1990s, Central African Republic is the only state to have had a proper democratic handover of power, in 1993. That\u2019s a very troubling record. In DRC, the peace agreements of 2002 that introduced the presidential term limit brought welcome stability. But the deal kicked justice issues into the long grass and did not address centralised and corrupt governance. Kabila, like his counterpart in Burundi, is almost certainly worried that justice for violence committed in the civil war may catch up with him if he leaves office. Trust, stability and the cohesion of the political system therefore lie at the heart of the \u201cthird term\u201d question. African leaders considering these issues, in the African Union (AU) and elsewhere, face complex dilemmas. Some don\u2019t believe in the principle of regularly handing over power. Others don\u2019t want to interfere in the internal affairs of a neighbour, unless the instability threatens their borders. Western powers promoting term limits therefore have no common African position to rally behind. They have also been frustratingly inconsistent, playing down Rwandan president Paul Kagame\u2019s machinations to serve another term, while condemning the decision of the Burundian president, Pierre Nkurunziza, to run for re-election. Pressure needs to be put on those unwilling to leave, but there comes a point when leaders are so entrenched that there seems little point in challenging their right to hold office. Calling it early is therefore vital. That is what the international community failed to do when Kabila removed the second round of the presidential elections in 2011 and went on to win a fraudulent election in November of that year. A political system is based on trust that everyone will abide by the rules to at least a minimum extent; without that, stability will be short-lived. The international community should speak out at the right moment against leaders overturning constitutional provisions to suit their own agenda. This is especially true when previous conflict means trust is in short supply or faith in elections as a means of transferring power has been undermined. Failure to speak out sends a message to opposition leaders that the only way to power is through violence \u2013 a conclusion that would spell disaster for DRC and other countries in the region.

      "bodyText": "Yangtze The moon glimmers in the brown channel. Strands of mist wrap the mountainsides crowded with firs. Declining cliffs sink beneath vast water. By remote paths, twisting pines. Far downstream two sides of a half-built bridge fail to meet. Our crude boat chugging points to Chongqing. As someone I now forget once said journeying is hard. My face greets the evening breeze I listen \u2013 the dream of a place. A cormorant dives by trembling light. From the white eyelet of a star the sound of ripples. * A fisherman skirting shore in his high-prowed skiff crossing bamboo oars comes up with a jolt \u2013 nets catch not fish but the wizened finger of a submerged branch for below a sunken valley persists \u2013 slick bare trunks furred in wafting fronds have water for sky, ghost forest. Roots rot deep in the hill where buried rock is still dry. Windows film, doors drift open in the empty concrete shells of houses towns that once held hundreds of thousands slowly filling with what, what is it they fill with? Someone I now forget once said journeying is hard. The moon glimmers in the brown channel. Yangtze is the concluding poem in Sarah Howe\u2019s Loop of Jade, her TS Eliot prize-winning first collection published last May by Chatto. Tracing memory over recent experience, and vice versa, Howe gathers into Loop of Jade an extended and variegated commentary on her return visits to mainland China and Hong Kong, where she lived until she was just shy of eight years old. A Renaissance scholar at Harvard University, Howe often writes a dense, coruscating kind of poem, where language is the foregrounded loop, and adds its own richness to the richness of memoir and \u201cdeep\u201d travelogue. On other occasions, as in Yangtze, she seems to stand back and trust a cooler, simpler, descriptive mode. Is this a voice from the Chinese \u201cside\u201d of her literary inheritance? Perhaps, but it also recalls an American poet still setting an example for later generations, Elizabeth Bishop. Yangtze\u2019s structure sometimes recalls that of haiku. Haiku is not, of course, a Chinese form, but there were Chinese nutrients in the soil of its flowering. Yangtze is evocatively haiku-like in some of its procedures: the somewhat ad hoc approach to punctuation (which often disappears altogether, enhancing the symbiotic flow of imagery), the juxtapositions, the silences, the sense of the unsaid. Grammatical connection may slip quietly away: in stanza two, for instance, \u201cBy remote paths, / twisting pines,\u201d and in the pure \u201chaiku moment\u201d of stanza five: \u201cFrom the white /eyelet of a star/ the sound of ripples.\u201d The movement between associative or impressionistic writing and the denotative is one of the poem\u2019s many pleasures. It imitates the mind in travelling mode \u2013 the way we might explain to ourselves (or check in the guidebook) the backstory of some new sight, or simply let impressions float over us. The poem goes with the flow of the river while accommodating the physicality of the journey: \u201cour crude boat / chugging / points towards Chonqing\u201d. I admire its effortlessly aleatory quality, its natural pattern-making and avoidance of symmetry. Each stanza is the length it needs to be, the length of a span of attention that naturally varies as it reflects what is seen, thought, felt. The diction is precision-tooled, yet appears transparent as clean water. The rhythm is slow, but never too slow. An asterisk after stanza five marks a pause, but it\u2019s the merest breathing space. When movement resumes, there\u2019s some luminous narrative detail about the fisherman in his \u201chigh-prowed skiff\u201d, and some some nice alliterative music, before a dreamlike descent into the underworld of \u201cthe sunken valley\u201d. Howe\u2019s short, sometimes one-beat units in the penultimate stanza (\u201ctowns that once / held hundreds / of thousands\u201d) seem to prepare for the ensuing self-interruption. The speaker is about to tell us what the shells of the abandoned houses \u201cfill with\u201d \u2013 when she finds she can\u2019t. It\u2019s a moment reminiscent of the concluding stanza of Bishop\u2019s One Art, where the speaker has to force herself, publicly, to write down the dreaded phrase admitting that losing her lover feels \u201clike disaster\u201d. Howe\u2019s missing word(s) may be too painful, or too elusive. Her question, urgent with repetition (\u201cwhat, what is it they fill with?\u201d) also corrects the tendency of poems, even with the most honourable intentions, to hasten towards emotive answers. The Yangtze has suffered cataclysms of development, noted here by a journalist describing her cruise from Chongqing to the Three Gorges Dam. It\u2019s been suggested that the erection of this vast hydroelectric plant is among the most significant alterations ever made to the natural world. Unmistakeably elegiac, Howe\u2019s poem notices effects rather than their cause. In addition to her eloquent local phenomena stands the symbolism of the unfinished bridge, indicating the bisection of tradition and progress, old and new technologies. The poem\u2019s embedded refrain, \u201cjourneying is hard\u201d, possibly from Li Po, (although many traveling poets have said the same) may be Howe\u2019s reference to China\u2019s costly march into modernity. That process is haunted \u2013 and so is the process of the poem. The river is haunted by the \u201cghost forest\u201d in in its depths. The water-haunted trees haunt their drought-stricken roots. The fisherman whose net catches \u201cthe wizened finger / of a submerged branch\u201d may sense the possibility of a failing livelihood. And, of course, the poem\u2019s last stanza is haunted, wonderfully, by what has been said and shown earlier, the \u2013 pretended? \u2013 failure to remember who said \u201cjourneying is hard\u201d and the image of the glimmering moon and \u201cthe brown channel\u201d. It\u2019s as if the river\u2019s course had been deflected from linearity to form yet another \u201cloop of jade\u201d in Howe\u2019s lustrously layered treasury of poetic time.",

The river is haunted by the \u201cghost forest\u201d in in its depths. The water-haunted trees haunt their drought-stricken roots. The fisherman whose net catches \u201cthe wizened finger / of a submerged branch\u201d may sense the possibility of a failing livelihood. And, of course, the poem\u2019s last stanza is haunted, wonderfully, by what has been said and shown earlier, the \u2013 pretended? \u2013 failure to remember who said \u201cjourneying is hard\u201d and the image of the glimmering moon and \u201cthe brown channel\u201d. It\u2019s as if the river\u2019s course had been deflected from linearity to form yet another \u201cloop of jade\u201d in Howe\u2019s lustrously layered treasury of poetic time.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Maricella Olvera encounters Donald Trump on occasion, but she\u2019s careful not to say a word. The 47-year-old cleans the penthouse at the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, where Trump, his family, and celebrity guests often come to stay. She cleans around them in silence. Trump is always uninterested. \u201cThe policy is: you don\u2019t talk to the boss,\u201d she said at her small one-bedroom home, on the joyously named Sing Song Way in the city\u2019s northern suburbs. While Olvera may be silent at work, she and a collective of cleaners, bar workers, and kitchen staff at the Trump hotel have been a thorn in the billionaire\u2019s side for the past year, using what voice they have to remind the public of the hypocrisy that surrounds his audacious run for the presidency and his record as an employer. Although Trump has touted himself as \u201cthe greatest jobs president that God has ever created\u201d, these workers point to the fact they are paid on average $3 less than the thousands of unionised hotel workers in Las Vegas who work identical jobs and enjoy a host of other benefits, including pensions and free health insurance, not available to Trump employees. Earlier this month, following a protracted dispute with Trump and his co-owner, casino billionaire Phil Ruffin, the National Labor Relations Board officially certified a union for over 500 staff at the hotel. Workers argue they have been subjected to surveillance, intimidation, and unlawful dismissal as they have sought to organize. Hotel management has so far consistently rejected calls to sit down and negotiate a new contract and appear likely to appeal the certification. It is estimated by the Culinary Workers Union that 98% of casinos and hotels on the strip and in downtown Las Vegas are unionised, making the company\u2019s stance a near total outlier. Meanwhile, the billionaire\u2019s campaign filings reveal he values his stake in the hotel at $50m, with a generated income of more than $27m. Olvera left her impoverished hometown in Central Mexico in 1987. She trekked for three days on foot to cross the US border, eventually making it to Salinas, California, where she immediately started work on the fields. She picked broccoli, lettuce and berries for 14 hours a day, seven days a week. Only 14 years old, she started sending money back to her family straight away. Twenty-nine years on, Olvera is now a permanent resident of the US, with two sons about to graduate from medical school. Like almost 70% of unionised workers at the Trump hotel who are also immigrants, she worries about job insecurity while suffering the indignity of a boss running for president on an aggressive immigration platform that leaves the staff themselves feeling targeted. \u201cHe has said bad things,\u201d she said stridently. \u201cI know my people. My people work in the fields, my people [are] kitchen workers, my people [are] landscaping \u2013 honest people, working hard to make money. Nobody give you nothing for free.\u201d The disdain reflects a broader consensus among Latino voters: Trump is likely to face the highest unfavorability rating among the demographic in history (close to 90%) if he secures the Republican nomination in July. \u201cA lot of guests tell me, \u2018I\u2019m sorry for [what] Donald Trump said [to] your people,\u2019\u201d she said, regaining a smile. \u201cI say, \u2018It\u2019s OK.\u2019 I respect all minds.\u201d Olvera was not at work when the National Labor Relations Board ruled against Trump. In January, she slipped and fell, severely injuring her knee, while cleaning a tall mirror in one of the luxury condos. She now walks with crutches, and survives on $49 a day in disability payment. The payment amounts to half of her actual compensation, $14.28 an hour. The Culinary Workers Union says she would receive full pay on a unionised contract. \u201cMy two sons pay [for] my car, my insurance, all my bills, my electricity, everything right now,\u201d she said. She has stopped sending money back to Mexico for the first time in years. She worries about her mortgage repayments, but the more pressing concern is the surgery on her knee that will determine when she can return to work, and how much she will owe in medical bills. The hotel shimmers in the daylight; its windows are coated in 24-carat gold, which turns the natural light inside the bedrooms a sickly shade of green. At 64 storeys, it is one of the tallest buildings in Las Vegas and manages to distinguish itself in a city renowned for vulgarity. The lobby is heavily perfumed, with an overwhelming synthetic coconut smell. The Trump Store sells an extensive range of branded products, from Trump piggy banks and Trump cuddly toys to Trump champagne glasses and wine glasses. At the hotel\u2019s poolside bar, H2 (Eau), Frank Sinatra croons on the stereo, Make America Great Again caps are stacked next to vintage bottles of bourbon, and a Trump quote is emblazoned on a large mirror: \u201cAs long as you\u2019re going to be thinking anyway, think big.\u201d David, a salesman from Brooklyn, sits on a stool drinking a gin and tonic and clutching a cigar. A Trump supporter and regular at the hotel, he describes it as \u201cthe best in Vegas\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s no ding, ding, ding, like the casinos,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a classy place. Trump\u2019s a classy guy.\u201d The cleaning staff stay mostly invisible, using separate elevators and doorways to reach the immaculately kept rooms. Celia Vargas, a 57-year-old cleaner, has worked at the hotel full time for three years, earning $14 an hour. Now a US citizen, she fled civil war in El Salvador aged 23 and crossed the US southern border smuggled inside a small container on the back of a truck. \u201cI have always felt very proud of my work,\u201d she said at the home she shares with her daughter and seven grandchildren. \u201cBut I feel that for Mr Donald Trump, we don\u2019t matter as workers or as human beings. For Mr Donald Trump, we\u2019re just a number.\u201d Her employment has been plagued with uncertain working hours, she said, meaning she can be paid as little as $350 a week. \u201cMy expenses often don\u2019t match my budget, so I always end up owing more or having to get loans, or pawning or selling something of mine in order to get enough.\u201d Vargas was diagnosed with breast cancer last June. Her insurance did not cover the full costs of treatment, leaving her in thousands of dollars in debt, and it would not pay for a full night in hospital for her to recover after surgery \u2013 her daughter came to fetch her two hours after the operation, and took her home while she was still drowsy from the anaesthesia. Trump hotel workers see up to $132 in health insurance payments deducted from their biweekly paychecks, according to the Culinary Workers Union, and should receive free and more comprehensive insurance if on a union contract. Vargas was forced to sell her own apartment two years ago after her husband, also a migrant from El Salvador, who worked a well paid job as a cook on the Las Vegas strip, was arrested following an alleged DUI incident and transferred to immigration detention. He has been detained for two and half years now, and moved all around the country. Vargas has not seen him since December last year, when she made the five-hour drive to visit him in Orange County, California. He would face certain deportation under Trump\u2019s hardline immigration platform. Vargas was one of the first to organise the workforce, and says when they first started wearing small, pro-union badges, she was sacked along with six other colleagues, until the Culinary Workers Union intervened and got her employment reinstated. Another former employee, 47-year-old Rosebert Donato, had worked at the hotel for three years, earning $11.20 an hour as a linen attendant on the late shift. Donato was fired shortly after the vote to unionize in December last year and argued he was targeted because of his participation in the union. \u201cThey fired us like we were delinquents,\u201d Vargas said. The Trump Organization, the holding company which owns Trump\u2019s stake in the hotel, did not respond to a list of detailed questions despite multiple requests. Historically, union-busting has never been Trump\u2019s style. He has long relied on unionised workforces to construct and staff his businesses in New York and New Jersey. In his 2000 book The America We Deserve, he wrote an impassioned defence of Jim Hoffa, president of one of America\u2019s largest unions, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters: \u201cLet me tell you this: Unions still have place in American society. In fact, with the globalization craze in full heat unions are about the only political force reminding us to remember the American family.\u201d On the campaign trail, too, Trump has celebrated his lengthy list of union endorsements. \u201cI have tremendous support within unions,\u201d he said in February. \u201cMy support is really with those workers, those people \u2026 the policemen, the firemen, the construction workers, the lathers, the sheetrock workers, the electricians, the plumbers.\u201d So why, in a city with such a rich history of trade unionism, in a swing state that Trump will hope to win if he secures the nomination, bother picking a fight he looks set to lose? Some with knowledge of the negotiations suggested it was Trump\u2019s son Eric who had pushed the company\u2019s unwavering stance. Others pointed to his carefully guarded image as a straight talking hardman that he was unlikely to relinquish for the duration of the presidential race. But perhaps the dispute best exemplifies Trump\u2019s entirely unpredictable nature: his extraordinary ability to say one thing, and do something entirely different. At Vargas\u2019s home, as dinner was about to be served, the results from the New York primary beamed in live on the TV. As Trump celebrated his landslide victory, he took to the lectern in Trump Tower. \u201cWe have problems everywhere you look,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to solve those problems. And one of the big problems is the economy and jobs, and that is my wheelhouse.\u201d Vargas shook her head in silence.",

      "bodyText": "Mark Haddon is never going to be accused of writing the same book twice. For those who admired The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time (everyone), there is bound to be, with each new book he writes, the sneaky wish to re-experience the startling enjoyment of that funny, disarming, unrepeatable bestseller. But novels should not have to compete with one another. Since 2003, Haddon has written a couple of involving novels \u2013 A Spot of Bother (2006) and The Red House (2012) and now this collection of short stories. His publishers alert us to the likelihood that we will find his imagination \u201ceven darker than we had thought\u201d. An understatement \u2013 I would not have described Haddon\u2019s imagination as dark at all until now. The title story is a virtuoso piece of writing \u2013 the account of a falling pier. It is minutely described (it reminded me of Stanley Spencer\u2019s crowded Southwold beachscape). A sensational disaster, it is told in an unsensational way. It is not quite a story, more a penetrating snapshot of a calamity in which all the characters are strangers, although some are fleetingly introduced in their last moments. Haddon overturns what Philip Larkin called the \u201cminiature gaiety\u201d of the seaside as tragedy trashes it \u2013 his ghost train is newly haunted. It is a compliment to the power of the writing that it made me mutinous to read about such horror as if it were entertainment. Every line makes you believe what he writes, his eye misses nothing. I know those seaside balustrades whose \u201cpistachio-green paint has blistered and popped in a hundred years of salt air\u201d. It is especially challenging because the disaster is unsupported by intimacy. It is a story about randomness \u2013 as accidents are. Haddon achieves what newspapers often fail to do: he makes it real. The pier is his main character, in the most terrible sense, the mover and shaker. You will be ready for light relief after this opener but do not travel in hope: The Island is the story of a princess in a tapestry, \u201ca woman weeping on a beach, and far out, in the chop and glitter of the woven sea, a single ship sailing steadily towards the border and the world beyond\u201d. It has a non-specific Grecian feel \u2013 the princess\u2019s unnamed mother, like Europa, was raped by a bull. In this story, as in the first, there is a strong cast of birds \u2013 shearwaters climb the air \u201clike ashes above a fire\u201d. The writing itself is beautiful, in glittering contrast to the desperate state in which the abandoned princess struggles to survive on an island of inedible berries, rotting seals and unidentified shellfish. She clutches at stones from which she can strike no spark. It is a nightmare with a grotesque and brilliantly executed ending. In Bunny we leap forward to the present, with what could be a companion piece to Lionel Shriver\u2019s novel Big Brother. This story is about Bunny, a helplessly obese man, and kicks off with a list of his preferred groceries. His mother cooks sardines for him, spends his disability allowances and tells him: \u201cI\u2019m going to save your life.\u201d Bunny has no time for the concept of comfort eating: \u201cHe had not been comfortable for a very long time.\u201d Haddon is excellent at evoking the depressing look of Bunny\u2019s house: \u201cThe wallpaper must have gone up circa 1975, psychedelic bamboo shoots in red and orange, peeling a little at the edges.\u201d A room as distempered as the earlier seaside balustrade and with people to match. The ending of this story again horrified me. A feel-bad factor rules. What the stories have in common is a struggle for survival. There is a particularly disturbing but not implausible, story, The Woodpecker and the Wolf, about volunteer \u201csofanauts\u201d: \u201cPeople willing to be fired into space on top of a 700-tonne firework.\u201d The ghastly description of an operation to remove an appendix in space shows there are no limits to Haddon\u2019s gravity-defying imagination. But the best \u2013 and the worst, if you are darkness-averse \u2013 is Wodwo (the wild man made familiar by Ted Hughes). This is masterly and unforgettable. It starts as a Christmas story \u2013 one guesses it will be about the combustible effect of Christmas on family. But this turns out to be a tame expectation. A stranger appears at the window with a gun \u2013 he is, possibly, a former psychiatric patient of the elderly doctor of the house. For the doctor\u2019s son, Gavin, \u201can extravagantly gifted man\u201d with a \u201cmonstrous ego\u201d, life is about to unravel. The stories are willed experiments, imagination\u2019s darkest what-ifs. There is something bordering on wanton about them. It is no good hoping for a laugh or a positive tweak, let alone (with, possibly, one exception) a happy ending. Yet their execution is outstanding. And I recognise the paradox that Haddon, although ostensibly in control as the writer, is concerned with all that lies beyond control. People are at the mercy of each other. As Robyn, a character in Breathe, puts it: \u201cYou can\u2019t just decide how you want things to be, Carol.

Physical fitness comes with games.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cEvery season is different but for the last six years I was at the top. When I was in France I was on the top and it is the first time in my career when I feel I am not on the top, but I need to learn. I am still young, I need to learn every day. I hope it will be better next year.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The father of a Sydney teenager accused of plotting a terrorist attack on Anzac Day has pled for his son to be released on bail, saying he \u201cwould do anything\u201d to get him home. The Parramatta children\u2019s court is hearing a bail application for the 16-year-old, who was arrested last week after allegedly trying to source a gun and an explosives manual. His father said on Monday he would ensure round-the-clock supervision of the teenager, lock up electronic devices in the house and even sleep in the same bed to monitor him. \u201cTo get my son back home I would do anything ... I love him with all my heart and he\u2019s everything to me,\u201d he said. He told his son, watching on via video link: \u201cI love you\u201d. Crown prosecutor Chris Choi alleged the boy had been planning the attack from at least 16 April, when he allegedly sent a text to someone saying: \u201cI want to learn how to make a bomb\u201d. She said he allegedly \u201ctook steps to obtain a gun and a bomb manual in order to commit a terrorist attack on Anzac Day\u201d. When asked why he chose 25 April, the teenager allegedly replied: \u201cBecause here in Australia the kafir (non-Muslims) celebrate Anzac Day and I want to terrorise them on the day\u201d, according to Choi. The boy\u2019s mother wept and buried her head on her husband\u2019s shoulder during the prosecutor\u2019s address. He has been in custody since 24 April, when he was arrested by counter-terrorism police near his home in Sydney\u2019s west. Choi said the teenager, who cannot be named, first came under police investigation between 5 and 8 May last year. He was at that time referred to the national disruption group and agreed to undergo a de-radicalisation program to address \u201cviolent, extremist behaviours\u201d, a program which he was still on when arrested. \u201cThe prosecution\u2019s submission is, Your Honour, it (the program) hasn\u2019t worked in relation to this young person,\u201d Choi said. She said his alleged online communications had had a sense of urgency, and he had made handwritten declarations calling for shariah law. The court heard that his profile picture for a messaging application was a lion on the Islamic State flag and there was evidence on his phone that he\u2019d accessed recruitment videos and other Islamic State propaganda. Choi said there was a serious risk the boy would fail to appear or endanger the safety of the public if he was granted bail. If he was released, she argued, he had a greater urgency to achieve \u201cwhat he failed to do\u201d on Anzac Day. The boy\u2019s lawyer, Zemarai Khatiz, has argued he should be granted bail because his age and youth meant there were exceptional circumstances in place. Last week Khatiz submitted a list of strict potential bail conditions, including a condition the boy would wear an ankle bracelet if released. Khatiz also said the boy\u2019s family was willing to use its $1.2m home as security if the teenager was granted bail. Lawyers for the teenager had tried to have media excluded from the bail hearing, arguing publicity around his arrest was \u201cadding to [his] psychological burden\u201d. The hearing continues.",

      "bodyText": "Paddy Ashdown has accused the government of acting dishonourably in the case of an Afghan interpreter who reportedly killed himself while facing deportation from Britain. Nangyalai Dawoodzai is understood to have worked for the British army in Afghanistan for three years, before fleeing the country after receiving death threats from the Taliban. The 29-year-old, who paid people smugglers to reach the UK, was told his request for asylum in Britain had been rejected when it was found he had been fingerprinted in Italy on arrival in Europe, according to the Daily Mail. Under the EU\u2019s Dublin regulation, aimed at preventing multiple asylum claims by individuals, Dawoodzai had to pursue his claim in the first country he applied in. Faced with being sent back to Italy to claim political asylum there he killed himself, a fellow translator told the newspaper. Lord Ashdown, who has championed the cause of Afghan war interpreters for years, said their treatment was scandalous. \u201cIt wrenches your heart out sideways. Here is a man who served in Helmand, probably on the frontline, who did it day in and day out for British troops, no going back home every six months, whose family were not tucked away safe but was in the community. \u201c[He] then had to leave Afghanistan because of death threats and because we would not honour our commitment to him, and travels across half the world to get to us. Made the mistake of being fingerprinted in Italy and then struggles to get across the Channel, we don\u2019t know how he did it, and is then going to get sent back. \u201cAs an act of shame in our nation dishonouring the service these people have given, I can\u2019t think of a worse one,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme. In March, David Cameron told the House of Commons a set of conditions for Afghan interpreters to be given sanctuary in Britain had been agreed while in coalition with the Lib Dems. The PM said there was also a scheme in place for Afghans who want to help rebuild their war-ravaged country. According to the Mail, at least three other interpreters who served UK forces in war zones currently face deportation because they were fingerprinted in mainland Europe before arriving in the UK. The chairman of the Commons defence select committee, Julian Lewis, said he hoped the case would press UK authorities to take a \u201cmore generous and enlightened attitude\u201d towards former interpreters, should Dawoodzai\u2019s case be verified. He said: \u201cMany people will share my bafflement and concern that we seem unable to get rid of people who mean us harm and unwilling to take people who have served us loyally.\u201d Dawoodzai reportedly told a fellow former interpreter he worked with British soldiers based at Camp Bastion in Helmand province. He had been staying at a hostel in Birmingham when his application was rejected after the Italian records were found. He was reportedly arrested and held in a detention centre for 18 days. On release he returned to the hostel while his paperwork was processed. The interpreter told the newspaper: \u201cHe was depressed and very down. He said his life was at risk and no one cared \u2026 He believed that Britain would help him because he had helped them. Now he has killed himself \u2013 it is so desperate.\u201d A Home Office spokesman said: \u201cWe are very saddened by this tragic case. As investigations are continuing, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Concern over 'political' use of solitary confinement in European prisons", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "European prisons are increasingly resorting to solitary confinement to counteract the threat of terrorism, despite warnings about its impact, defence lawyers and human rights advocates say. France, Belgium and the Netherlands are all deploying solitary and \u201csmall-group isolation\u201d on suspected and convicted terrorists to prevent radicalisation of prisoners. In Belgium, about 35 people are placed on isolation measures, spending 23 hours a day in their cell and one hour in a small recreation yard, also alone. Four individuals are in solitary confinement on the recently opened de-radicalisation units in the country, with more expected to arrive in the future. In France, an unknown number of terrorism suspects are being in held in isolation blocks. Over the past year or so, France has also established several dedicated units for deradicalisation, but an apparent lack of rehabilitative or therapeutic programming means prisoners remain in their cells most of the day. In the Netherlands, where terrorist wings have nearly reached their capacity, men are being strip and cavity searched each time they have contact with a third party or go to court. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned about political pressures to isolate terrorists and to build special units to isolate them,\u201d said Sharon Shalev, a research associate at Oxford University\u2019s faculty of law and an expert on solitary confinement. \u201cThe public, our politicians, and our prison administrations, should keep a cool head,\u201d she added. Despite the increase, the number of people held in solitary confinement in Europe is tiny compared with the US, where as many as 100,000 people are kept in segregated cells. That number sets the US apart from most of the rest of the world and exceeds the entire prison populations of countries such as the UK, France and Germany. Last week the Guardian reported on how the Obama administration is pressing individual states to join its mission to cut back on the use of solitary confinement in the US. Human rights lawyers point to the psychological and physical consequences of isolation, and say that its use may amount to torture or ill-treatment. Additional concerns have been expressed about the big rise in the use of small-group isolation in Europe, in which people are segregated from the general population, although not necessarily from each other. Prison isolation may not only be inhumane, but also ineffective. Critics say the practice may make people more vulnerable to extremist ideas, and stress that eliminating communication among prisoners is often impossible. Solitary is not new to Europe nor is it used exclusively for terrorists. Yet the Charlie Hebdo attacks of January 2015 \u2013 where at least two of the gunmen were said to have been \u201cradicalised\u201d on the inside \u2013 left Europeans fearful, angry and hungry for action. Almost immediately, officials and prison administrations identified isolation as a key tool in preventing future violence. An internal memo issued by the director general of the Belgian prison service in the months after Charlie Hebdo stressed the importance of taking action to stem the spread of radicalisation. The memo said: \u201cEvery prisoner who is incarcerated for terrorist acts must be placed immediately under MSPI\u201d \u2013 an isolation status that can last for a month. Nicolas Cohen is a lawyer who has represented terrorism suspects and is also vice-president of the International Observatory of Prisons (OIP) in Belgium, which studies whether conditions comply with international norms and human rights laws. Cohen read from a psychiatric evaluation of one of his clients in isolation since last July, in which the prisoner is described as agitated and observed to be speaking to the walls. A majority of the men held in the 10-cell high-security unit in Bruges are terrorism suspects, according to Cohen. When a prisoner is placed in isolation in an ordinary jail, they can still hear sounds from the cells around them. \u201cIn Bruges there is no such noise and feeling,\u201d Cohen said in an email. \u201cYou have to be handcuffed through a hole in the door before getting out.\u201d The unit, known as the QMSPI, has been fiercely criticised by human rights groups in the past. A Belgian prison spokeswoman, Kathleen Van De Vijver, said there were protections in place for prisoners in isolation, including the requirement to renew their classification at regular intervals. She also said that prisoners received regular visits from doctors and psychiatrists, who could submit recommendations to prison authorities for ameliorated conditions, although Cohen said these were almost always denied. \u201cThey\u2019re applying the strictest measures against them,\u201d said Marie Cretenot, a French lawyer for OIP, when asked about the conditions on the inside for alleged terrorists, adding that long-term isolation could amount to inhumane and degrading treatment under article 3 of the European convention on human rights. The UN special rapporteur on torture, Juan M\u00e9ndez, has called for an absolute ban on isolation in excess of 15 days. Lawyers in Belgium and France also said that people had been subject to sleep deprivation because of frequent nightly checks by guards. The French ministry of justice did not respond to requests for comment. Andr\u00e9 Seebregts, a defence lawyer, said the constant strip and cavity searches on the Netherlands\u2019 two terrorist units were humiliating and counter-productive. \u201cI do have some guys who go in there, not too angry at the Dutch government, and when they come out they\u2019re a lot more negative.\u201d Jaap Oosterveer, a press officer for the ministry of security and justice, said prisoners had exaggerated claims of mistreatment for political purposes. Isolation may, in any case, be futile. Charlie Hebdo attacker Amedy Coulibaly is said to have been radicalised by alleged al-Qaida recruiter Djamel Beghal while the two were in solitary confinement in a prison south of Paris. One of their cells was below the other, and they allegedly passed messages through their windows using drink bottles tied to sheets. Other countries have used different approaches to managing radicalisation. The UK disperses suspected and convicted terrorists across high-security facilities, a policy that some say prevents potentially dangerous friendships or hierarchies from forming. A pending government review into extremism in British prisons, however, may overhaul the approach to terrorist prisoners. Arun Kundnani examined counter-extremism policies in the US and the UK in his recent book, The Muslims are Coming. \u201cThe underlying assumption of most radicalization models is that terrorism is caused by ideology spreading like a virus from person to person,\u201d he told the Guardian, adding that this was flawed. Others say governments should do more to address the social inequalities, and foreign policy decisions, that help shape people\u2019s sense that violence is the answer. \u201cThey\u2019re taking these measures which are just political posturing, and that are not very useful in the end,\u201d Seebregts said of the security measures in Dutch prisons. \u201cIt\u2019s just to show the people that they\u2019re doing something.\u201d",

Four individuals are in solitary confinement on the recently opened de-radicalisation units in the country, with more expected to arrive in the future.</p> <p>In France, an unknown number of terrorism suspects are being in held in isolation blocks. Over the past year or so, France has also established several dedicated units for deradicalisation, but an <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/islamic-radicalization-french-prisons-can-isolation-program-prevent-charlie-hebdo-2249922\">apparent lack</a> of rehabilitative or therapeutic programming means prisoners remain in their cells most of the day.<br /></p> <p>In the Netherlands, where terrorist wings have nearly reached their capacity, men are being strip and cavity searched each time they have contact with a third party or go to court.<br /></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very concerned about political pressures to isolate terrorists and to build special units to isolate them,\u201d said Sharon Shalev, a research associate at Oxford University\u2019s faculty of law and an expert on solitary confinement. \u201cThe public, our politicians, and our prison administrations, should keep a cool head,\u201d she added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/sixbynine/index.html\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/sixbynine/index.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Despite the increase, the number of people held in solitary confinement in Europe is tiny compared with the US, where as many as 100,000 people are kept in segregated cells. That number sets the US apart from most of the rest of the world and exceeds the <a href=\"http://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/reforming-solitary-confinement-in-us-prisons-and-jails#_ftnref15\">entire prison populations</a> of countries such as the UK, France and Germany.</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/28/obama-administration-urges-states-to-curb-use-of-solitary-confinement\">the Guardian reported</a> on how the Obama administration is pressing individual states to join its mission to cut back on the use of solitary confinement in the US.</p> <p>Human rights lawyers point to the psychological and physical consequences of isolation, and say that its use may amount to torture or ill-treatment. Additional concerns have been expressed about the big rise in the use of small-group isolation in Europe, in which people are segregated from the general population, although not necessarily from each other.<br /></p> <p>Prison isolation may not only be inhumane, but also ineffective. Critics say the practice may make people more vulnerable to extremist ideas, and stress that eliminating communication among prisoners is often impossible.<br /></p> <p>Solitary is not new to Europe nor is it used exclusively for terrorists. Yet the Charlie Hebdo attacks of January 2015 \u2013 where at least two of the gunmen were said to have been \u201cradicalised\u201d on the inside \u2013 left Europeans fearful, angry and hungry for action. Almost immediately, officials and prison administrations identified isolation as a key tool in preventing future violence.<br /></p> <p>An internal memo issued by the director general of the Belgian prison service in the months after Charlie Hebdo stressed the importance of taking action to stem the spread of radicalisation. The memo said: \u201cEvery prisoner who is incarcerated for terrorist acts must be placed immediately under MSPI\u201d \u2013 an isolation status that can last for a month.</p> <p>Nicolas Cohen is a lawyer who has represented terrorism suspects and is also vice-president of the International Observatory of Prisons (OIP) in Belgium, which studies whether conditions comply with international norms and human rights laws.<br /></p> <p>Cohen read from a psychiatric evaluation of one of his clients in isolation since last July, in which the prisoner is described as agitated and observed to be speaking to the walls. </p> <p>A majority of the men held in the 10-cell high-security unit in Bruges are terrorism suspects, according to Cohen. </p> <p>When a prisoner is placed in isolation in an ordinary jail, they can still hear sounds from the cells around them. \u201cIn Bruges there is no such noise and feeling,\u201d Cohen said in an email. \u201cYou have to be handcuffed through a hole in the door before getting out.\u201d The unit, known as the QMSPI, has been fiercely criticised by human rights groups in the past.</p> <p>A Belgian prison spokeswoman, Kathleen Van De Vijver, said there were protections in place for prisoners in isolation, including the requirement to renew their classification at regular intervals. She also said that prisoners received regular visits from doctors and psychiatrists, who could submit recommendations to prison authorities for ameliorated conditions, although Cohen said these were almost always denied. </p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re applying the strictest measures against them,\u201d said Marie Cretenot, a French lawyer for OIP, when asked about the conditions on the inside for alleged terrorists, adding that long-term isolation could amount to inhumane and degrading treatment under article 3 of the European convention on human rights.

      "bodyText": "Just before every game at the Vicente Calder\u00f3n, high in the main stand where you can see the Almudena cathedral as well as you can see the players, they helpfully hand out two team sheets with the day\u2019s line-ups: one for the pitch and one for the palco, the directors\u2019 box where everybody\u2019s called Don and everything goes on. Including, this weekend, the decision that might have changed their destiny. It helps to know that \u00d3liver Torres is in and Fernando Torres isn\u2019t, after all; that Jes\u00fas G\u00e1mez starts at the back and Antoine Griezmann starts on the bench; that joining the presidents of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Rayo Vallecano is a secretary of state for something or other; and that the ambassadors are here from Romania, Albania and Belgium. That\u2019s what it said on Saturday, anyway. And they weren\u2019t alone: the palco was also packed with singers and bands \u2013 apparently music and football \u201cshare the same values\u201d \u2013 from Celtas Cortos to Sidecar and Mago de Oz, from Antonio Carmona to Jorge Drexler, while down on the touchline the lead singer of the rock group The Garb paced back and forth, all dressed in black. Germ\u00e1n \u201cEl Mono\u201d Burgos, vocalist, guitarist and assistant coach, was there because Diego \u201cEl Cholo\u201d Simeone was not. Banned for three games after a ballboy tried to break up a M\u00e1laga attack, his name wasn\u2019t on that handy list but he was in the directors\u2019 box too, in front of the musician and Atl\u00e9ti fan Pancho Varona. He didn\u2019t much like what he saw from there; probably didn\u2019t much like what he heard either. Atl\u00e9tico were playing Rayo and playing for the title. For the second week in a row the three contenders played one after the other and in order, kicking off two and a quarter hours apart. Third-placed Real Madrid had struggled but they had just gone top with a 1-0 victory against Real Sociedad in the 4pm kick off, secured with Gareth Bale\u2019s ninth header of the season in the 80th minute. First-placed Barcelona were facing Real Betis at 8.30pm, where they would struggle too but where goals from Ivan Rakitic and Luis Su\u00e1rez would give them a 2-0 victory. Between them, in the 6.15 kick-off, second-placed Atl\u00e9tico knew that a win meant fighting another week, keeping them neck and neck in this five-match sprint that had begun 10 days earlier, while a defeat or a draw meant The End. A defeat or draw looked increasingly possible, too. Three days after facing Bayern Munich and three days before facing them again Atl\u00e9tico had made seven changes to the starting XI, Simeone later saying that what he sought was \u201cfreshness\u201d; but freshness wasn\u2019t working. It was still 0-0 at half time and Atl\u00e9tico had had only two shots on target. So Simeone headed down to the dressing room \u2013 in Spain a touchline ban allows for that \u2013 and made his first change, one that might have been even more important than it first seemed. It was not just that he sent Koke Resurrecci\u00f3n on to the pitch, it was that he sent Gabi Fern\u00e1ndez, his captain, on to the bench. Where he played a key role. As the second half began things weren\u2019t improving; the goal wasn\u2019t coming and didn\u2019t really look like coming either. Fresh? They looked flat. There was time, sure, but the clock ticked and Atl\u00e9tico hadn\u2019t yet taken a shot. Rayo, on the other hand, had and one they probably should have scored from, Javi Guerra hitting straight at Jan Oblak. The momentum was going Rayo\u2019s way, the home fans were unusually quiet, nervous, and from way up there Simeone couldn\u2019t choreograph the Calder\u00f3n. Well, not directly. Simeone sat in the palco, with Diego God\u00edn to the left of him and Pablo Vercellone. Vercellone is the goalkeeper coach and he was wearing an ear piece with a microphone attached to it; way down below them, sitting on the bench, Gabi was wearing one exactly the same. As the game went on, every now and then the captain turned coach and Gabi would get up and shout instructions to his team-mates from the edge of the pitch. Mostly, though, he seemed to be conveying them from the bench or to Burgos. The assumption was that the chain of command ran from Simeone to Vercellone to Gabi to Burgos (or from Gabi directly to the players) and the images seem to bear that out. The rules state that a suspended coach is not allowed to give instructions, by any means, to those taking part in the game; whether what went on counts is debatable, as any instructions are certainly not directly given and also impossible to prove; whether the key decision came from the palco is too. The club director Clemente Villaverde insisted that Simeone had not been communicating with anyone. What is not debatable is that it was decision time; time for a change. A few minutes had gone in the second half and Atl\u00e9tico needed to go and get a goal. The scoreboard said 54 minutes; the subs board said 7 and 9. A roar went up as Torres and Griezmann stood at the side of the pitch and it never really had the chance to die down. Griezmann ran on and pretty much just kept on running ... straight into the ball. A clearance came to him; with his first touch, somewhere near his stomach, he got there ahead of an opponent knocking the ball out ahead of him, momentum carrying him forward, and with his second, he hit it, hard and on the bounce, taking off, both feet in the air, sending it rocketing into the net from just outside the area. He had been on the pitch 42 seconds. Griez lightning! He\u2019d arrived and kissed the Saint, as the Spanish phrase has it. Kissed him? Griezmann had leapt straight into bed with Roger Moore. And much the same was happening up in the stands and up in the directors\u2019 box too. \u201cWatching the game a metre from Simeone and God\u00edn was special,\u201d Varona said. \u201cWhat a hug they gave each other when the goal went in!\u201d. \u201cCholo\u2019s Plan B works,\u201d Marca said. \u201cCholo\u2019s Plan A,\u201d AS said, perhaps a little more accurately. After all, he had begun with only four regular starters, then got the goal when he sent on three regular starters, including Griezmann, the man who has played more games than anyone else and who has now scored 30 goals this season, 21 in the league. 1-0, Atl\u00e9tico top, job done, time to take him off again? Not exactly \u2013 and they\u2019d used up all three substitutions already \u2013 but it did feel a little like that and the Frenchman did reposition himself much deeper: at times it felt as if he was playing out the game as an additional defender. And quite brilliantly, too: heading, clearing, tackling. Every time the ball went towards the Atl\u00e9tico box he seemed to be there sending it away again; every time a Rayo player turned inside he was in front of them. \u201cThose of us who came on did all we could to help the team win,\u201d he said. When it was not him, which it really was remarkably often, it was a team-mate. Over and over for 36 long minutes that would have felt much longer for any other team. After all a goal would have ended everything, but it\u2019s 610 minutes since they conceded one. There were nerves, suffering too, but no one does \u201csuffering\u201d quite like Atl\u00e9tico: at the end of last week\u2019s league game, Simeone insisted he would rather be 2-0 up and \u201ccomfortable\u201d, that he does not live easy at 1-0 and certainly does not seek that scoreline out, despite what it may seem at times. But he did admit that his team can handle the tension of a tight scoreline, that they know how to manage situations like this. And so they did, yet again. There was something classically Atl\u00e9tico about this, comfortingly familiar, from this being the 10th time Griezmann has scored the opening goal in the league to it being the 10th time a single goal was enough; from this being their fourth 1-0 in a row to it being their 31st clean sheet of the season, their 23rd in the league. Two-thirds of their league matches, in other words. Atl\u00e9tico are not a team that give in. Nor, right now, are Madrid or Barcelona. There was something familiar in the way this round of games ended too, something that left Marca declaring it \u201csimply the best league in the world\u201d. Griezmann put Atl\u00e9tico top 110 minutes after Bale had put Real Madrid top and 130 minutes before Rakitic put Barcelona top again. All three had suffered but all three had won again; for the second week in a row, they had taken it in turns at the top. And so on it goes, from Barcelona 76, Atl\u00e9tico 76, Real Madrid 75, to Barcelona 85, Atl\u00e9tico 85, Madrid 84: still no margin for error, still all in it, still not surrendering in the tightest title race in the world. In exactly four hours Real Madrid, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and FC Barcelona had all been third, second and first but at the end of it all they were back where they had begun, only that bit closer to the line. Talking points \u2022 \u201cI hope we can win and screw the league up for them,\u201d Antonio Ad\u00e1n said. Which, while lots of people flew into now-familiar faux rage of righteous indignation, wasn\u2019t really a particularly outrageous thing to say (even if the way he said it was bound to wind some people up). He is the Real Betis goalkeeper, after all, and wanting to win is, well, what footballers are supposed to want to do ... and winning would mean screwing up the league for Barcelona. Then there\u2019s the fact that he is a former Real Madrid player and youth teamer who still supports the club. So, maybe it wasn\u2019t such a bad thing to say. As it turned out, it was a pretty unfortunate thing to say. Because far from screwing Barcelona he sort of saved them. Luis Enrique insisted his team had \u201cnot suffered at all\u201d but nor were they making Betis suffer much. In fact, Barcelona seemed to be doing that play-really-slowly-without-going-anywhere-in-the-first-half thing, a plan which is never a good one. And one which seemed even sillier on Saturday: when you have no other competitions to rest players for, no need to conserve energy and when you need to score and when one of the biggest problems you\u2019re likely to face is not having the time to get it, wilfully(?) giving up 45 minutes seems basically pretty bonkers. But, still, that\u2019s what they did. They played with fire, to a soundtrack of the Betis fans singing Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s anthem and chanting \u201cChampions! Champions!\u201d Until, that was, the 50th minute and Ad\u00e1n\u2019s rescue mission. With Betis down to 10 men after Heiko Westermann\u2019s daft tackle had got him a second yellow, Leo Messi dinked a ball over the top, Ad\u00e1n came out to claim it, calling (but calling late) for Germ\u00e1n Pezzella to leave it, only for the defender to try to clear it with an overhead kick. Pezzella missed it, Ad\u00e1n missed it too, and Rakitic scored to put Barcelona top again and just two games away. Messi then produced an astonishing pass for Luis Su\u00e1rez to make it safe and to make it 35 for the season \u2013 more league goals than any Barcelona player has got, ever. Apart from Messi. The league title should have been easy, it should have been sewn up weeks ago, but the advantage is still Barcelona\u2019s. Just about. Next up: the Catalan derby with Espanyol. \u201cWe had the league won; now we have to go and win it again,\u201d Gerard Piqu\u00e9 said. \u201cAnd if we do win it like this now, we will celebrate twice as much.\u201d \u2022 Probably best you don\u2019t read that last bit, Luis Enrique. The Barcelona manager was not happy with suggestions that his side had not played well. And while he can happily ignore ABC\u2019s Salvador Sostres, the columnist who said \u201cBetis lost the game but Barcelona lost their dignity\u201d, not least because Sostres shows no sign of knowing what dignity is, he was stung by some of the other criticisms. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? If you don\u2019t win 8-0 it doesn\u2019t count?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis is a competitive league with three teams trying to win it. We have got you so used to good things that you\u2019ve lost track of what competitive football is like; we never said it was won. I don\u2019t think they [Atl\u00e9tico and Madrid] will lose games; it\u2019s up to us to win them all. It\u2019s still in our hands.\u201d \u2022 Speaking of people who probably shouldn\u2019t speak, Dani Ceballos, who once said that he hoped a bomb would go off at the Barcelona-Athletic Copa del Rey final and \u201ckill\u201d those \u201cBasque and Catalan dogs\u201d, and whose Twitter back catalogue contains a fair few gems, seemed to be trying to take a Catalan or two down all on his own, seemed to be trying to take a Catalan or two down all on his own. Piqu\u00e9, especially. It\u2019s rare to see a player completely and utterly lose his head but he did; if he had one in the first place. Eventually, his manager took him off before he got sent off. Which he was lucky not to have been already. \u2022 Real Madrid have now won 10 league games in a row which makes them sound much better than they have really been, but there\u2019s definitely something about them now. For the second week in a row it was Gareth Bale who rescued them. With 10 minutes left in a game that had gone flat at Anoeta against a Real Sociedad team that, just as Madrid were without Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo, had pretty much all of their forwards missing (Vela, Agirretxe, Jonathas) and their captain and central defender out, Bale scored his 19th goal of the season to claim a 1-0 win. Of those 19, nine have been with his head, more than any player in any of Europe\u2019s five biggest leagues. The Prince of Bale-Air, Marca called him, Santi Segurola declaring him a hammer in the air, \u201cas good as any of the great heading specialists in the world ... or better\u201d. \u201cBale put on his superhero\u2019s costume and he is not taking it off,\u201d AS said, while Mad Madridista Tom\u00e1s Roncero was banging on about \u201cthe G spot\u201d ... \u201cG for Gareth, G for goal, G for giant and G for Wales.\u201d Which is spelt with a G in Spanish. \u201cHis goal left me open-mouthed,\u201d Lucas V\u00e1zquez admitted. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight to the end; hopefully the others will slip up,\u201d Sergio Ramos said. \u2022 Speaking of goalkeepers and trying to win, when Real Sociedad got a free kick in the very last minute, goalkeeper Ger\u00f3nimo Rulli decided to go up for it. The free kick was so desperate that it was pointless but his decision to attack didn\u2019t please everyone, some seeing something suspicious (or worse still almost immoral) in it what with la Real having no real objective to play for. \u201cI always want to win,\u201d Rulli tweeted later. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m not allowed to try to help my team draw. Some people don\u2019t understand anything.\u201d \u2022 Shot of the day came from Bruma, whose free-kick sailed over the wall, over the goal and bounced back off the car that\u2019s parked on the running track at Anoeta. \u2022 \u201cIf they don\u2019t want us in fifth or in a European place, they could at least tell us and we\u2019ll save on the flights and hotels.\u201d Anyone else think that Iago Aspas was not impressed with the referee after his side\u2019s 2-1 defeat at San Mam\u00e9s? He probably should have been more annoyed with team-mate Gustavo Cabral, mind you. \u201cWe didn\u2019t deserve to lose,\u201d Toto Berizzo insisted and he was probably right too. \u2022 Celta started well, all over Athletic for the first half an hour, until Cabral gave away a clear penalty and got himself in an on-going cheaty-kicky-pushy battle with Aritz Aduriz that ended with a red card when he brushed his studs across the Athletic striker\u2019s cheek. \u201cThe red card was a tonteria [stupid thing] between two players,\u201d Ernesto Valverde said. \u201cEvery decision went against us,\u201d Berizzo claimed. Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda eventually won the game, hitting a wedge shot from the floor to score the second. \u2022 Up in the stands was Paolo Maldini, winner of Athletic\u2019s second One Club Man Award, which he had received before the game from legendary goalkeeper \u201cEl Chopo\u201d Iribar. \u2022 Sevilla: just one game away from going an entire season without winning away. And that one game is at San Mam\u00e9s. Espanyol\u2019s players ended in tears, relieved at a victory that secures survival. \u2022 So all three of them won \u2026 No, not the three at the top. Well, them too. But the three at the bottom. 19th, 18th and 17th. Above them, 16th (Rayo) were defeated and below them, Levante play on Monday. They already knew there was little hope last week; they know that there is even less of one now. Three shots were enough for Sporting Gijon to score twice against Eibar, with Jony leading the way again. Granada came from 2-0 down to make it 2-2 after just 22 minutes and eventually beat Las Palmas 3-2 with a lovely strike from Rub\u00e9n Rochina and two thumping headers from corners as they threaten to produce yet another barely believable run of results to survive, although they still have to go to Sevilla and play Barcelona. \u2022 The goal of the week came in that Granada game. Jonathan Viera. Woof. \u2022 \u201cThis is not Anfield, this is Mestalla,\u201d ran the cover of Super Deporte, the \u201cnewspaper\u201d that never lets you down. They sought to strike fear into the hearts of Villarreal, but there was no fear. Nor was there any distraction; not on the pitch, anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable that minds will be on Liverpool,\u201d Marcelino Garcia Toral had said and he made 10 \u2013 yes, 10 \u2013 changes from the side that started against Liverpool yet Villarreal still deservedly defeated Valencia 2-0. That win means that Villarreal clinched the final Champions League place, with two weeks to spare. \u201cThis is the confirmation of a fantastic season,\u201d Marcelino rightly said. \u201cThis is extraordinary, really, a huge achievement. We\u2019re the sixth or seventh squad in terms of budget and we\u2019re 20 points above Valencia, 11 above Sevilla. Without star players it\u2019s magnificent to be fourth. This is memorable.\u201d \u2022 Roberto Soldado did it again. The new Soldado, that is. Never mind the goals, he has now provided as many assists in a season for Villarreal as any other player, ever, having drawn level with the man who was his best friend in London: Santi Cazorla. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable that minds will be on Liverpool,\u201d Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral said. But if so, it didn\u2019t show. \u2022 A Briton rose high to head in a vital goal for his Spanish side, just when they needed it most. No, not Gareth Bale, but Charlie I\u2019Anson.

It helps to know that \u00d3liver Torres is in and Fernando Torres isn\u2019t, after all; that Jes\u00fas G\u00e1mez starts at the back and Antoine Griezmann <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/726455917810737152\">starts on the bench</a>; that joining the presidents of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Rayo Vallecano is a secretary of state for something or other; and that the ambassadors are here from Romania, Albania and Belgium.</p> <p>That\u2019s what it said on Saturday, anyway. And they weren\u2019t alone: the <em>palco</em> was also packed with singers and bands \u2013 apparently music and football \u201cshare the same values\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM9zHF4e810\">from Celtas Cortos</a> to Sidecar and Mago de Oz, from Antonio Carmona to Jorge Drexler, while down on the touchline the lead singer of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N2MLr48S2E\">the rock group The Garb</a> paced back and forth, all dressed in black. Germ\u00e1n \u201cEl Mono\u201d Burgos, vocalist, guitarist and assistant coach, was there because Diego \u201cEl Cholo\u201d Simeone was not. Banned for three games <a href=\"http://www.goal.com/en/news/722/la-liga/2016/04/27/22858692/simeone-banned-for-rest-of-liga-season?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">after a ballboy tried to break up a M\u00e1laga attack</a>, his name wasn\u2019t on that handy list but he was in the directors\u2019 box too, in front of the musician and Atl\u00e9ti fan Pancho Varona. He didn\u2019t much like what he saw from there; probably didn\u2019t much like what he heard either.</p> <p>Atl\u00e9tico were playing Rayo and playing for the title. For the second week in a row the three contenders played one after the other and in order, kicking off two and a quarter hours apart. Third-placed Real Madrid had struggled but they had just gone top with a 1-0 victory against Real Sociedad in the 4pm kick off, secured with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/30/real-sociedad-real-madrid-la-liga-match-report\">Gareth Bale\u2019s ninth header of the season</a> in the 80th minute. First-placed Barcelona were facing Real Betis at 8.30pm, where they would struggle too but where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/30/real-betis-barcelona-la-liga-match-report\">goals from Ivan Rakitic and Luis Su\u00e1rez </a>would give them a 2-0 victory. Between them, in the 6.15 kick-off, second-placed Atl\u00e9tico knew that a win meant fighting another week, keeping them <a href=\"http://www.espnfc.com/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/2853937/barcelona-open-up-la-liga-title-race-for-atletico-and-real\">neck and neck in this five-match sprint</a> that had begun <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/21/luis-suarez-fernando-torres-la-liga-barcelona-atletico\">10 days earlie</a>r, while a defeat or a draw meant The End.</p> <p>A defeat or draw looked increasingly possible, too. Three days <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/27/atletico-madrid-bayern-munich-champions-league-match-report\">after facing Bayern Munich</a> and three days before facing them again Atl\u00e9tico had made seven changes to the starting XI, Simeone later saying that what he sought was \u201cfreshness\u201d; but freshness wasn\u2019t working. It was still 0-0 at half time and Atl\u00e9tico had had only two shots on target. So Simeone headed down to the dressing room \u2013 in Spain a touchline ban allows for that \u2013 and made his first change, one that might have been even more important than it first seemed. It was not just that he sent Koke Resurrecci\u00f3n on to the pitch, it was that he sent Gabi Fern\u00e1ndez, his captain, on to the bench. Where he played a key role.</p> <p>As the second half began things weren\u2019t improving; the goal wasn\u2019t coming and didn\u2019t really look like coming either. Fresh? They looked flat. There was time, sure, but the clock ticked and Atl\u00e9tico hadn\u2019t yet taken a shot.</p> <p>Rayo, on the other hand, had and one they probably should have scored from, Javi Guerra hitting straight at Jan Oblak. The momentum was going Rayo\u2019s way, the home fans were unusually quiet, nervous, and from way up there Simeone couldn\u2019t choreograph the Calder\u00f3n.</p> <p>Well, not directly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5c209e6fa47d478c622d311e8013af8a50efa7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5c209e6fa47d478c622d311e8013af8a50efa7d/0_238_2561_1537/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simeone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diego Simeone reacts in the Vicente Calder\u00f3n stands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susana Vera/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simeone sat in the <em>palco</em>, with Diego God\u00edn to the left of him and Pablo Vercellone. Vercellone is the goalkeeper coach and he was wearing an ear piece with a microphone attached to it; way down below them, sitting on the bench, Gabi was wearing one exactly the same. As the game went on, every now and then the captain turned coach and Gabi would get up and shout instructions to his team-mates from the edge of the pitch. Mostly, though, he seemed to be conveying them from the bench or to Burgos. The assumption was that the chain of command ran from Simeone to Vercellone to Gabi to Burgos (or from Gabi directly to the players) and <a href=\"http://www.cuatro.com/deportes/futbol/operacion-Simeone-ordenes-grada-Calderon_2_2171955148.html\">the images seem to bear that out</a>. <a href=\"http://www.rfef.es/sites/default/files/pdf/CODIGO-DISCIPLINARIO-TEMPORADA-2015-2016.pdf\">The rules</a> state that a suspended coach is not allowed to give instructions, by any means, to those taking part in the game; whether what went on counts is debatable, as any instructions are certainly not directly given and also impossible to prove; whether the key decision came from the <em>palco</em> is too. The club director Clemente Villaverde insisted that Simeone had not been communicating with anyone. What is not debatable is that it was decision time; time for a change.</p> <p>A few minutes had gone in the second half and Atl\u00e9tico needed to go and get a goal. The scoreboard said 54 minutes; the subs board said 7 and 9. A roar went up as Torres and Griezmann stood at the side of the pitch and it never really had the chance to die down. Griezmann ran on and pretty much just kept on running ... straight into the ball. A clearance came to him; with his first touch, somewhere near his stomach, he got there ahead of an opponent knocking the ball out ahead of him, momentum carrying him forward, and with his second, he hit it, hard and on the bounce, taking off, both feet in the air, sending it rocketing into the net from just outside the area. He had been on the pitch 42 seconds. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bghayward/status/726462861237690373\">Griez lightning</a>!</p> <p>He\u2019d arrived and kissed the Saint, as the Spanish phrase has it.</p> <p>Kissed him? Griezmann had leapt straight into bed with Roger Moore. And much the same was happening up in the stands and up in the directors\u2019 box too. \u201cWatching the game a metre from Simeone and God\u00edn was special,\u201d Varona said. \u201cWhat a hug they gave each other when the goal went in!\u201d. \u201cCholo\u2019s Plan B works,\u201d Marca said. \u201cCholo\u2019s Plan A,\u201d AS said, perhaps a little more accurately. After all, he had begun with only four regular starters, then got the goal when he sent on three regular starters, including Griezmann, the man who has played more games than anyone else and who has now scored 30 goals this season, 21 in the league.</p> <p>1-0, Atl\u00e9tico top, job done, time to take him off again? Not exactly \u2013 and they\u2019d used up all three substitutions already \u2013 but it did feel a little like that and the Frenchman did reposition himself much deeper: at times it felt as if he was playing out the game as an additional defender. And quite brilliantly, too: heading, clearing, tackling. Every time the ball went towards the Atl\u00e9tico box he seemed to be there sending it away again; every time a Rayo player turned inside he was in front of them. \u201cThose of us who came on did all we could to help the team win,\u201d he said. When it was not him, which it really was remarkably often, it was a team-mate. Over and over for 36 long minutes that would have felt much longer for any other team. After all a goal would have ended everything, but it\u2019s 610 minutes since they conceded one.</p> <p>There were nerves, suffering too, but no one does \u201csuffering\u201d quite like Atl\u00e9tico: at the end of<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/23/atletico-madrid-malaga-la-liga-match-report\"> last week\u2019s league game</a>, Simeone insisted he would rather be 2-0 up and \u201ccomfortable\u201d, that he does not live easy at 1-0 and certainly does not seek that scoreline out, despite what it may seem at times. But he did admit that his team can handle the tension of a tight scoreline, that they know how to manage situations like this. And so they did, yet again. There was something classically Atl\u00e9tico about this, comfortingly familiar, from this being the 10th time Griezmann has scored the opening goal in the league to it being the 10th time a single goal was enough; from this being their fourth 1-0 in a row to it being their 31st clean sheet of the season, their 23rd in the league. Two-thirds of their league matches, in other words. Atl\u00e9tico are not a team that give in.</p> <p>Nor, right now, are Madrid or Barcelona. There was something familiar in the way this round of games ended too, something that left Marca declaring it \u201csimply the best league in the world\u201d. Griezmann put Atl\u00e9tico top 110 minutes after Bale had put Real Madrid top and 130 minutes before Rakitic put Barcelona top again. All three had suffered but all three had won again; for the second week in a row, they had taken it in turns at the top.</p> <p>And so on it goes, from Barcelona 76, Atl\u00e9tico 76, Real Madrid 75, to Barcelona 85, Atl\u00e9tico 85, Madrid 84: still no margin for error, still all in it, still not surrendering in the tightest title race in the world.</p> <p>In exactly four hours Real Madrid, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and FC Barcelona had all been third, second and first but at the end of it all they were back where they had begun, only that bit closer to the line.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 \u201cI hope we can win and screw the league up for them,\u201d Antonio Ad\u00e1n said. Which, while lots of people flew into now-familiar faux rage of righteous indignation, wasn\u2019t really a particularly outrageous thing to say (even if the way he said it was bound to wind some people up). He is the Real Betis goalkeeper, after all, and wanting to win is, well, what footballers are supposed to want to do ... and winning would mean screwing up the league for Barcelona. Then there\u2019s the fact that he is a former Real Madrid player and youth teamer who still supports the club. So, maybe it wasn\u2019t such a bad thing to say. As it turned out, it was a pretty unfortunate thing to say. Because far from screwing Barcelona he sort of saved them.</p> <p>Luis Enrique insisted his team had \u201cnot suffered at all\u201d but nor were they making Betis suffer much. In fact, Barcelona seemed to be doing that play-really-slowly-without-going-anywhere-in-the-first-half thing, a plan which is never a good one. And one which seemed even sillier on Saturday: when you have no other competitions to rest players for, no need to conserve energy and when you need to score and when one of the biggest problems you\u2019re likely to face is not having the time to get it, wilfully(?) giving up 45 minutes seems basically pretty bonkers.</p> <p>But, still, that\u2019s what they did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"826afba3cb63edb91f60124be32d124099625b7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/826afba3cb63edb91f60124be32d124099625b7e/0_105_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luis Su\u00e1rez\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luis Su\u00e1rez scores Barcelona\u2019s second goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They played with fire, to a soundtrack of the Betis fans singing Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s anthem and chanting \u201cChampions! Champions!\u201d Until, that was, the 50th minute and Ad\u00e1n\u2019s rescue mission. With Betis down to 10 men after Heiko Westermann\u2019s daft tackle had got him a second yellow, Leo Messi dinked a ball over the top, Ad\u00e1n came out to claim it, calling (but calling late) for Germ\u00e1n Pezzella to leave it, only for the defender to try to clear it with an overhead kick. Pezzella missed it, Ad\u00e1n missed it too, and Rakitic scored to put Barcelona top again and just two games away. Messi then produced an astonishing pass for Luis Su\u00e1rez to make it safe and to make it 35 for the season \u2013 more league goals than any Barcelona player has got, ever. Apart from Messi.</p> <p>The league title should have been easy, it should have been sewn up weeks ago, but the advantage is still Barcelona\u2019s. Just about. Next up: the Catalan derby with Espanyol. \u201cWe had the league won; now we have to go and win it again,\u201d Gerard Piqu\u00e9 said. \u201cAnd if we do win it like this now, we will celebrate twice as much.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Probably best you don\u2019t read that last bit, Luis Enrique. The Barcelona manager was not happy with suggestions that his side had not played well. And while he can happily ignore ABC\u2019s Salvador Sostres, the columnist who said \u201cBetis lost the game but Barcelona lost their dignity\u201d, not least because Sostres shows no sign of knowing what dignity is, he was stung by some of the other criticisms. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? If you don\u2019t win 8-0 it doesn\u2019t count?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis is a competitive league with three teams trying to win it. We have got you so used to good things that you\u2019ve lost track of what competitive football is like; we never said it was won. I don\u2019t think they [Atl\u00e9tico and Madrid] will lose games; it\u2019s up to us to win them all. It\u2019s still in our hands.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Speaking of people who probably shouldn\u2019t speak, Dani Ceballos, who once said that he hoped a bomb would go off at the Barcelona-Athletic Copa del Rey final and \u201ckill\u201d those \u201cBasque and Catalan dogs\u201d, and whose Twitter back catalogue contains a fair few gems, seemed to be trying to take a Catalan or two down all on his own, seemed to be trying to take a Catalan or two down all on his own. Piqu\u00e9, especially.</p> <p>It\u2019s rare to see a player completely and utterly lose his head but he did; if he had one in the first place. Eventually, his manager took him off before he got sent off. Which he was lucky not to have been already.</p> <p>\u2022 Real Madrid have now won 10 league games in a row which makes them sound much better than they have really been, but there\u2019s definitely something about them now. For the second week in a row it was Gareth Bale who rescued them. With 10 minutes left in a game that had gone flat at Anoeta against a Real Sociedad team that, just as Madrid were without Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo, had pretty much all of their forwards missing (Vela, Agirretxe, Jonathas) and their captain and central defender out, Bale scored his 19th goal of the season to claim a 1-0 win. Of those 19, nine have been with his head, more than any player in any of Europe\u2019s five biggest leagues. The Prince of Bale-Air, Marca called him, Santi Segurola declaring him a hammer in the air, \u201cas good as any of the great heading specialists in the world ... or better\u201d. \u201cBale put on his superhero\u2019s costume and he is not taking it off,\u201d AS said, while Mad Madridista Tom\u00e1s Roncero was banging on about \u201cthe G spot\u201d ... \u201cG for Gareth, G for goal, G for giant and G for Wales.\u201d Which is spelt with a G in Spanish. \u201cHis goal left me open-mouthed,\u201d Lucas V\u00e1zquez admitted. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight to the end; hopefully the others will slip up,\u201d Sergio Ramos said.</p> <p>\u2022 Speaking of goalkeepers and trying to win, when Real Sociedad got a free kick in the very last minute, goalkeeper Ger\u00f3nimo Rulli decided to go up for it. The free kick was so desperate that it was pointless but his decision to attack didn\u2019t please everyone, some seeing something suspicious (or worse still almost immoral) in it what with la Real having no real objective to play for. \u201cI always want to win,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gerorulli/status/726460891051515905\">Rulli tweeted later</a>. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m not allowed to try to help my team draw. Some people don\u2019t understand anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Shot of the day</strong> came from Bruma, whose free-kick sailed over the wall, over the goal and bounced back off the car that\u2019s parked on the running track at Anoeta.</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cIf they don\u2019t want us in fifth or in a European place, they could at least tell us and we\u2019ll save on the flights and hotels.\u201d Anyone else think that Iago Aspas was not impressed with the referee after his side\u2019s 2-1 defeat at San Mam\u00e9s? He probably should have been more annoyed with team-mate Gustavo Cabral, mind you. \u201cWe didn\u2019t deserve to lose,\u201d Toto Berizzo insisted and he was probably right too.</p> <p>\u2022 Celta started well, all over Athletic for the first half an hour, until Cabral gave away a clear penalty and got himself in an on-going cheaty-kicky-pushy battle with Aritz Aduriz that ended with a red card when he brushed his studs across the Athletic striker\u2019s cheek. \u201cThe red card was a <em>tonteria</em> [stupid thing] between two players,\u201d Ernesto Valverde said. \u201cEvery decision went against us,\u201d Berizzo claimed. Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda eventually won the game, hitting a wedge shot from the floor to score the second.</p> <p>\u2022 Up in the stands was Paolo Maldini, winner of Athletic\u2019s second One Club Man Award, which he had received before the game from legendary goalkeeper \u201cEl Chopo\u201d Iribar.</p> <p>\u2022 Sevilla: just one game away from going an entire season without winning away. And that one game is at San Mam\u00e9s. Espanyol\u2019s players ended in tears, relieved at a victory that secures survival.</p> <p>\u2022 So all three of them won \u2026 No, not the three at the top. Well, them too. But the three at the bottom. 19th, 18th and 17th. Above them, 16th (Rayo) were defeated and below them, Levante play on Monday. They already knew there was little <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/apr/25/levante-left- needing-miracle-fight-avoid-la-liga-drop\">hope last week</a>; they know that there is even less of one now. Three shots were enough for Sporting Gijon to score twice against Eibar, with Jony leading the way again. Granada came from 2-0 down to make it 2-2 after just 22 minutes and eventually beat Las Palmas 3-2 with a lovely strike from Rub\u00e9n Rochina and two thumping headers from corners as they threaten to produce yet another barely believable run of results to survive, although they still have to go to Sevilla and play Barcelona.</p> <p>\u2022 The goal of the week came in that Granada game. Jonathan Viera. Woof.</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cThis is not Anfield, this is Mestalla,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.superdeporte.es/media/portadas/2016/05/01//superdeporte_1.pdf\">ran the cover of Super Deporte</a>, the \u201cnewspaper\u201d that never lets you down. They sought to strike fear into the hearts of Villarreal, but there was no fear. Nor was there any distraction; not on the pitch, anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable that minds will be on Liverpool,\u201d Marcelino Garcia Toral had said and he made 10 \u2013 yes, 10 \u2013 changes from the side that started against Liverpool yet Villarreal still deservedly defeated Valencia 2-0. That win means that Villarreal clinched the final Champions League place, with two weeks to spare. \u201cThis is the confirmation of a fantastic season,\u201d Marcelino rightly said. \u201cThis is extraordinary, really, a huge achievement. We\u2019re the sixth or seventh squad in terms of budget and we\u2019re 20 points above Valencia, 11 above Sevilla. Without star players it\u2019s magnificent to be fourth. This is memorable.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Roberto Soldado did it again. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/27/villarreal-roberto-soldado-spurs-liverpool-europa-league-semi-final\">The new Soldado</a>, that is. Never mind the goals, he has now provided as many assists in a season for Villarreal as any other player, ever, having drawn level with the man who was his best friend in London: Santi Cazorla. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable that minds will be on Liverpool,\u201d Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral said. But if so, it didn\u2019t show.</p> <p>\u2022 A Briton rose high to head in a vital goal for his Spanish side, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mestalla_VAVEL/status/726486620514426886\">just when they needed it most</a>. No, not Gareth Bale, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/04/charlie-i-anson-elche-englishman-la-liga\">but Charlie I\u2019Anson</a>.</p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> Sporting 2\u20130 Eibar, Real Sociedad 0\u20131 Real Madrid, Atl\u00e9tico 1\u20130 Rayo, Betis 0\u20132 Barcelona, Granada 3\u20132 Las Palmas, Athletic 2\u20131 Celta, Espanyol 1\u20130 Sevilla, Deportivo 0\u20132 Getafe, Valencia 0-2 Villarreal.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For the first time since chief superintendent David Duckenfield told Graham Kelly of the FA, while the Hillsborough disaster was still unfolding, that Liverpool fans had forced open an exit gate, the shadow of official culpability has been lifted from the supporters there on the day. Twenty-seven years on, finally no blame is attached to them, though we knew that already. Those of us all over the country who had gone to games and been treated worse than herd animals had known from the beginning. Football was frequently a depressing way of spending your time in the 1980s, and when it wasn\u2019t depressing it could be terrifying. Standing on unroofed terraces as the snow was whipped along the length of the pitch and driven into your face by the wind, and using toilets open to the elements left you in no doubt where you came in the priorities of those who ran things. As miserable as the match-going experience could be, you sometimes put yourself in danger just being there too. Darts and knives were thrown inside grounds. Vicious gangs of hooligans roamed outside, intent on doing harm. Being caught in a crowd outside a badly designed stadium with an insufficient number of turnstiles, inadequate stewarding and indifferent policing was a common problem. It could happen five minutes before kick-off or an hour beforehand. When it did you had no option but to push and shove against your neighbouring fans to position yourself in front of a turnstile in order to get into the ground. You certainly couldn\u2019t go in the opposite direction. Being part of a fired-up crowd on the terraces during a game was exhilarating and a little scary at the same time. You were physically affected by events, swept up and down the concrete steps as waves of excitement ebbed and flowed. The exhilaration was tempered but also honed in a way by the knowledge that things could so easily go wrong at any moment, though my perception of the possible seriousness was very much less than I now know to be the case. A fourth-round FA Cup tie between Newcastle and Swindon in 1988 is now remembered mostly because the Swindon manager and chairman were discovered to have bet on their team to lose and were subsequently fined by the FA. I remember it more for the crush in the street outside the Gallowgate End beforehand, where I had no control over my movements, my feet didn\u2019t touch the ground for several minutes and the police rode horses through the middle of us with no purpose apparent to me. The first game I ever attended without my dad to look after me was a fixture against West Ham in 1980 during which a petrol bomb was thrown into the away fans. There was an unreal normality following the incident. I don\u2019t recall play even stopping; within minutes people behaved as if something extraordinary hadn\u2019t just happened, and I wasn\u2019t aware of it even making the news that night. At the time football was a still largely a working-class pastime. To Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government it was a backwards hobby; like the trade union movement it harked back to a bygone era, and just like the unions it played no part in her vision of the future. Policies that cut adrift an entire stratum of society caused the growth of social unrest and rioting in our inner cities, but hooliganism in football was treated as if it were separate to the world outside the game. Football clubs, complacent as ever, saw no profit in improving facilities as the incomes of their customers stagnated. Hooligan behaviour did not trigger the Hillsborough disaster. It had, however, given the authorities an excuse to clamp down hard on supporters, treating them as a lumpen problem mass. If you went to football, you and everyone else in the crowd were regarded as potential criminals, a problem to be struggled with, homogeneous and dangerous at the same time. In the absence of any attempt to address the problems faced by society generally, it was decided football needed to get its house in order. That meant the containment of the problem of football fans both metaphorically and physically, and eventually the erection of fences inside football stadiums that would prove so lethal at Hillsborough. There was also a more subtle effect. Fans had been able to be painted as this uniformly frightening group, baffling and impenetrable in their motives. It suited the authorities to do so because it made it easier for them to deal with a problem they would rather not have had to. The supposed uniformity meant no distinction needed to be made between the treatment of individuals, and the terror they engendered meant no one would object too much if they were subjected to a little rough treatment. In the long run the result was that the lies told about Hillsborough by hostile institutions desperate to save their own necks were believable to the greater section of society who never went anywhere near a football ground. The lies confirmed what those people had already been led to believe about football fans, and the lies endured. In recent years there has been a proliferation of what is known as \u201chooligan porn\u201d: books and films glorifying the actions and attitudes of those who fought their way through city after city, one weekend after another. They regarded themselves as upholding the honour and good name of their club and community by putting up a good show in the face of that week\u2019s opponents. But without them and without the demonising of ordinary football fans their actions played a part in, it would have been impossible for policing and facilities to focus so exclusively on the prevention of crowd trouble at the expense of public safety. The subjects and consumers of such material should perhaps stop to consider that once in a while. Of course, the hooligans themselves cannot have all the blame placed at their feet. Even if they contributed to the attitudes and priorities of those who made the disastrous decisions that resulted in the shameful loss of life, it is those in authority both in government and in the police who made those decisions and must be brought to account.",

      "bodyText": "After months of official denials and futile obfuscation, that thing you\u2019ve been waiting for happened. You know, that thing you guessed was going to occur as soon as the credits rolled on the season five finale of Game of Thrones. Jon Snow got a haircut and a second shot at living. When I go to the barber, I don\u2019t even get a free rinse. Unfortunately for fans pining for a Game of Thrones/Weekend at Bernie\u2019s crossover, the deed was done and Jon Snow\u2019s alive again. Or whatever it is you call a corpse reanimated by black magic. Where last week\u2019s episode occasionally felt like an exercise in stalling, episode two resembled an especially frantic level of Sonic the Hedgehog where so much was happening on the screen that it all devolved into an animated blur, but with more exploding heads. Way more exploding heads, in fact. I counted two crushed skulls in 20 minutes, which is probably not even a record for this show. Every fan of Game of Thrones saw this coming, though. George RR Martin teased it. The novels upon which the show is based left plenty of breadcrumbs to follow. News outlets around the world did their part by running a \u201cJon Snow isn\u2019t really dead, is he?\u201d story once a week for the last six months. HBO, showrunners David Benioff and DB Weiss, and star Kit Harington all made a valiant effort to keep up the charade that Jon was kaput, but none of their truth-bending (Jon was technically dead for two episodes, so it wasn\u2019t an outright lie) made the reveal any less anti-climactic. At least it\u2019s done and the narrative can now push forward. The Wildlings have overtaken Castle Black, Alliser Thorne and his co-conspirators are locked up, and zombie Jon Snow is running around that little room completely naked, save for a strategically placed towel. The plot machinations that led to Jon\u2019s return are still a bit hazy for me, though. Ser Davos Seaworth \u2013 Game of Thrones\u2019 sad-faced puppy dog sidekick \u2013 decided off-screen to approach Melisandre about defying the most unassailable law of nature there is, a fairly bold move on his part. Davos and Jon really became best friends quickly, didn\u2019t they? Why was he so set on bringing him back to life? Did he just miss having someone to boss him around? Did he yearn to see that trademarked grimace/brow furrow combination one more time? Oh, and Davos was also very fortunate that Melisandre brought her pocket-sized guide to witchcraft to the Wall. Either that or she wrote the incantation she used on her hand and we just never saw her look at it. Maybe she just has an excellent memory for procedures she\u2019s never done before. For next week\u2019s episode, the stage is set for some particularly awkward reintroductions. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Jon. Again. Still. Last time you saw me, I was a very fit corpse with great cheekbones.\u201d Will the rank-and-file of the Night\u2019s Watch and the perpetually skeptical Wildlings actually embrace our slowly decaying hero? Is Jon still bound by his oath to the Watch even though he only promised to stick around until death? Will anyone acknowledge how absurd it is that dead guy Jon Snow\u2019s direwolf is named Ghost or will they all just pretend that\u2019s not a really weird coincidence? Is someone going to get the man some pants? My guess on that last one is a big yes. They will be loose-fitting in the waist but tapered at the leg, preferably a jogger or sweatpant for extra mobility. These pants will be comfortable, too. Very comfortable. There will be no underwear. I have seen it in the flames.",

      "body": "<p>After months of official denials and futile obfuscation, that thing you\u2019ve been waiting for happened. You know, that thing you guessed was going to occur as soon as the credits rolled on the season five finale of Game of Thrones. Jon Snow got a haircut and a second shot at living. When I go to the barber, I don\u2019t even get a free rinse.<br /></p> <p>Unfortunately for fans pining for a Game of Thrones/Weekend at Bernie\u2019s crossover, the deed was done and Jon Snow\u2019s alive again. Or whatever it is you call a corpse reanimated by black magic. Where last week\u2019s episode occasionally felt like an exercise in stalling, episode two resembled an especially frantic level of Sonic the Hedgehog where so much was happening on the screen that it all devolved into an animated blur, but with more exploding heads. Way more exploding heads, in fact. I counted two crushed skulls in 20 minutes, which is probably not even a record for this show.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/02/game-of-thrones-recap-season-six-episode-two-home\">Game of Thrones recap: season six, episode two \u2013 Home</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Every fan of Game of Thrones saw this coming, though. George RR Martin teased it. The novels upon which the show is based left plenty of breadcrumbs to follow. News outlets around the world did their part by running a \u201cJon Snow isn\u2019t really dead, is he?\u201d story once a week for the last six months. HBO, showrunners David Benioff and DB Weiss, and star Kit Harington all made a valiant effort to keep up the charade that Jon was kaput, but none of their truth-bending (Jon was technically dead for two episodes, so it wasn\u2019t an outright lie) made the reveal any less anti-climactic. At least it\u2019s done and the narrative can now push forward. The Wildlings have overtaken Castle Black, Alliser Thorne and his co-conspirators are locked up, and zombie Jon Snow is running around that little room completely naked, save for a strategically placed towel.</p> <p>The plot machinations that led to Jon\u2019s return are still a bit hazy for me, though. Ser Davos Seaworth \u2013 Game of Thrones\u2019 sad-faced puppy dog sidekick \u2013 decided off-screen to approach Melisandre about defying the most unassailable law of nature there is, a fairly bold move on his part. Davos and Jon really became best friends quickly, didn\u2019t they? Why was he so set on bringing him back to life? Did he just miss having someone to boss him around? Did he yearn to see that trademarked grimace/brow furrow combination one more time? Oh, and Davos was also very fortunate that Melisandre brought her pocket-sized guide to witchcraft to the Wall. Either that or she wrote the incantation she used on her hand and we just never saw her look at it. Maybe she just has an excellent memory for procedures she\u2019s never done before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/game_of_thrones_citadel/game-of-thrones-episode-2-the-mad-dogs-of-westeros\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F261961236&show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>For next week\u2019s episode, the stage is set for some particularly awkward reintroductions. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Jon. Again. Still. Last time you saw me, I was a very fit corpse with great cheekbones.\u201d Will the rank-and-file of the Night\u2019s Watch and the perpetually skeptical Wildlings actually embrace our slowly decaying hero? Is Jon still bound by his oath to the Watch even though he only promised to stick around until death? Will anyone acknowledge how absurd it is that dead guy Jon Snow\u2019s direwolf is named Ghost or will they all just pretend that\u2019s not a really weird coincidence? Is someone going to get the man some pants? My guess on that last one is a big yes. They will be loose-fitting in the waist but tapered at the leg, preferably a jogger or sweatpant for extra mobility. These pants will be comfortable, too. Very comfortable. There will be no underwear. I have seen it in the flames.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In algebra, X marks the spot. Well, sometimes it\u2019s N or Y. Either way, that spot can often leave children\u2019s heads spinning, as they find themselves face-to-face with funny-looking equations that need to be simplified. Maths doesn\u2019t always have the most positive reputation among young people (or older people, to be fair) and algebra \u2013 with its signs, symbols and substitutions \u2013 is up there with the least beloved of it. But it doesn\u2019t have to be intimidating. Presented in the right way, it can even be exciting and magical. So how can you help your students get to grips with the topic? Primary First, the basics. For young pupils, understanding the repetitive nature of patterns is a crucial step in laying the groundwork for algebra. You can use this interactive lesson and encourage your pupils to demonstrate their understanding by continuing a pattern on a string of beads. Or, if your craft supplies are plentiful, you could get them to replicate and complete the pattern in real life. There is more pattern play in these worksheets from Twinkl. This simple activity challenges pupils to work out the pattern in a series of numbers, and complete the row. Or, for a more visual approach, try this cut-out activity with images of the seaside (ice-creams, sandcastles and so on) to consolidate understanding of repetition. Then it\u2019s time to start thinking about substitution and equations. This clear animated video introduces those concepts with the story of a clown travelling to a party with a bunch of balloons. Children are introduced to a simple equation about the number that have blown away, and are shown how to solve it. (And if your class needs work presenting functions, try this resource, which uses a jigsaw activity to create simple sums.) To bring algebra to life in a real way, try these resources from TeachIt Primary. This investigation gets pupils to work out how many handshakes would take place if a class of 30 children all greeted each other this way. The children can then use their understanding of algebra to create a formula that will work for any number of participants. Meanwhile, this money problems activity peeks inside two pupils\u2019 wallets to develop an understanding of graphs and equations. Once your class has mastered this vital skill, you can test their understanding with these quizzes from PrimaryLeap, looking at balancing equations through addition and subtraction, and for higher-level skills, through multiplication and division. Secondary Get your students excited about algebra with this masterclass from maths teacher Jonny Heeley. It begins with a quick trick that enables Heeley to correctly guess the birthdays of three students, before he dresses up as a fruit seller and creates his own coffee shop to make algebraic concepts relatable and fun. Or, for an even more far-reaching look at the usefulness of algebra, this resource from the Royal Observatory Greenwich looks at the orbits of the planets. The cross-curricular activity begins by introducing the work of the 17th-century astronomer Johannes Kepler, who calculated that the orbits of planets were elliptical rather than circular. Students can then use their algebra to sketch the trajectories of different planets and use equations to work out just how elliptical an orbit is. Next, a question: can a hippopotamus and a mouse weigh the same amount? That\u2019s the puzzler this Guardian education article seeks to answer \u2013 and algebra is the way to do it. So if h stands for hippo and m stands for mouse, and the sum of their weights is 2x, it must stand that h + m = 2x. And so begins a journey through equations that seek to prove parity between the differently sized beasts. For an interactive look at algebra, try these resources from online maths portal MangaHigh. A game called Algebra Meltdown looks at equations and function machines via a group of angry scientists; a task entitled Save Our Dumb Planet explores linear equations through a mission to save Earth from a missile; while Wrecks Factor brings students up to speed with quadratic factorising. And finally, is there an equation to explain attraction? Could a formula be the key to finding love? The popularity of online dating sites suggests that lots of people think so, as explored in this collection of maths-related articles from the The Day. Other pieces look at the many obscure mathematical jokes hidden in episodes of The Simpsons, and a campaign to challenge the negative feelings some girls have about maths.

      "bodyText": "Eddie Hearn says he had a \u201cgreat meeting\u201d with Floyd Mayweather\u2019s business partner, Leonard Ellerbe, over the weekend, with \u201cexciting news coming soon\u201d. But British fans should not hold their breath in anticipation of Floyd coming out of retirement to fight Kell Brook. If Mayweather does fight again to round out a perfect 50-bout unbeaten career and finally overtake Rocky Marciano\u2019s record, it looks increasingly as if it will be against Danny Garcia, probably in Las Vegas in September. He will win, and it will do great business, but will we remember it fondly? There is one other soft option for Mayweather: a rematch with Andre Berto, who stopped a spent Victor Ortiz in four rounds in California on Saturday night. That is an even more depressing prospect. Brook \u2013 still smarting from being snubbed by Amir Khan \u2013 is being steered towards unifying two strands of the welterweight title against the WBO claimant Jessie Vargas, or to defend his own IBF version against Lamont Peterson, Khan\u2019s juiced-up conqueror in Washington five years ago. Hearn certainly knows how to tease the fans, though. \u201cGreat meeting just now with @LEllerbe \u2013 exciting news coming soon \u2013 @MayweatherPromo v @MatchroomBoxing in the UK\u201d, Hearn tweeted late on Saturday night. Ellerbe played his part by responding on Twitter: \u201cGreat meeting with @EddieHearn, we ready!!!!!!!!\u201d My guess is Hearn, Mayweather and Ellerbe, who are close, will parade their stable of fighters against each other to prop up the pay-per-view demands Sky Sports continue to make on Matchroom on a regular basis. A lot of these fights will be high-grade contests but, after the most predictable disappointment of the domestic season \u2013 Khan declining an offer to challenge Brook at Wembley Stadium mid-summer in favour of his mountainous challenge in Las Vegas this Saturday night against Sa\u00fal \u201cCanelo\u201d \u00c1lvarez \u2013 fans want more. They want the very best. They don\u2019t always get it. Khan-\u00c1lvarez promises high drama, whatever the result, but it will be in the middle of the night on Frank Warren\u2019s BoxNation (and assuredly the coverage will be entertaining). There is nothing to match the atmosphere of a big, outdoor showdown between intense rivals, as we saw when Carl Froch knocked out George Groves in front of 80,000 fans at Wembley Stadium in 2014. If it has to be in the States, watching Khan-\u00c1lvarez while trying to stay awake on a conveyor belt of coffee doesn\u2019t cut it for an audience who used to trek to Vegas 30,000-strong to watch Ricky Hatton. The fight Khan craved was Mayweather, only for the great man to renege twice. The Bolton fighter would be devastated if Floyd returned to the ring against Brook \u2013 and Hearn, who has had his moments with Khan, would be mightily pleased. I cannot see it happening. Boxing is a curious undertaking, with competition and mutual suspicion between promoters, TV outlets and governing bodies combining on a regular basis to frustrate all of us: fighters, fans and the media. Why, for instance, was James DeGale fighting in Washington, DC, on Saturday night in front of a roomful of strangers, strolling through 12, boxing-from-memory rounds to keep his IBF super-middleweight title against the dangerous but outclassed Rogelio Medina from Mexico? It was Chunky\u2019s third fight in a row abroad, in defence of the vacant title he won against Andre Dirrell a year ago. There are fans in Boston, Quebec and now Washington, DC, more recently familiar with the quirky style of Harlesden\u2019s favourite fighter than are regulars at the Echo Arena in Liverpool, Wembley Stadium (where he appeared on the undercard of Froch-Groves II), or, infamously, the Glow Bluewater in Rotherhithe, the last of his six fights with Mick Hennessy. \u201cThose boos are for DeGale. He\u2019s not won too many friends here tonight,\u201d Sky Sports\u2019 Nick Halling told us at the end, when the winner dismissed the loser in the ring. The judges returned cards of varying approval: 117-111, 116-112, and a ludicrous 115-113 from the Bostonian John Madfis. \u201cHe kept coming,\u201d DeGale said at ringside. \u201cI don\u2019t know where he got that from. Got to give credit to him, he\u2019s tough, durable, game. But to be an elite fighter, you\u2019ve got to have more than that. The main thing is I\u2019m still the champ. We\u2019ll have to go back to the drawing board, me and Jim [McDonnell, his career-long trainer]. Learning curve, learning curve.\u201d Medina was no more than a short-armed, stubborn challenger and, with the exception of a few eye-catching haymakers, had not a clue how to profitably land his heavy fists on DeGale\u2019s artfully bobbing head or dodge his painful switch-hitting counters. Surely, though, an Olympic gold medallist who has lost only once and contentiously \u2013 to George Groves six years ago, an eternity away on that learning curve \u2013 and is so obviously a worthy champion should be performing in front of big home crowds against high-class opponents on pay-per-view. The problem for DeGale, an interesting, likeable and hugely talented boxer, is he doesn\u2019t often deliver the animal buzz fight fans crave. He coasted against Medina because his is such a natural talent. It was entertaining for admirers of nuance and trickery. There aren\u2019t many of those in the amorphous constituency that Hearn, Warren and Hennessy, the country\u2019s leading promoters, are trying to sell their product to. It is the market. And, like the global financial beast that rules all our lives, it is not fair. There is little DeGale can do about the way he wins fights, even as a respected and legitimate champion, because it works. It\u2019s business. His next business will be a unification against Badou Jack, who kept his title but looked hard done by getting a majority draw against Lucien Bute on the undercard. \u201cIt\u2019s a dirty business.\u201d Jack said. \u201cI don\u2019t blame Bute. I blame the judges.\u201d DeGale told Jack later: \u201cI want to box in Vegas, but will you come to London? I\u2019m easy, man.\u201d There was no response. Jack and DeGale knew one thing: in all probability, they will fight in the United States. At ringside was a ready-made British opponent in Callum Smith, who expressed his willingness to step up and fight DeGale, preferably in the UK. Will it happen? At some point. Meanwhile, DeGale will continue taking care of business ... a long way from home. MEANWHILE ... Restoring faith in the rough old trade, the unbeaten Liam Walsh delivered stout, doomed Troy James only his second loss at the Copper Box Arena in London on Saturday night, to secure the Lonsdale Belt and the British super-featherweight title. Walsh was punch-perfect; James was swinging all the way to the stoppage in round eight. Walsh\u2019s twin brother, Ryan, looked classy winning the British featherweight belt with repeated body shots that finally told for James Tennyson in the fifth. They were two of several good wars on the BoxNation bill, none better than a nailed-on fight-of-the-year contender between the Irishman Jamie Conlan and the unbeaten Commonwealth super-fly champion, Anthony Nelson. Conlan won a classic up-and-downer with a body shot in the eighth, but both suffered and prospered throughout.",

I cannot see it happening.</p> <p>Boxing is a curious undertaking, with competition and mutual suspicion between promoters, TV outlets and governing bodies combining on a regular basis to frustrate all of us: fighters, fans and the media.</p> <p>Why, for instance, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/01/james-degale-beats-rogelio-medina-retain-ibf-super-middleweight-title-on-points\" title=\"\">James DeGale fighting in Washington, DC, on Saturday night</a> in front of a roomful of strangers, strolling through 12, boxing-from-memory rounds to keep his IBF super-middleweight title against the dangerous but outclassed Rogelio Medina from Mexico?</p> <p>It was Chunky\u2019s third fight in a row abroad, in defence of the vacant title <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/23/james-degale-ibf-title-andre-dirrell\" title=\"\">he won against Andre Dirrell a year ago</a>. There are fans in Boston, Quebec and now Washington, DC, more recently familiar with the quirky style of Harlesden\u2019s favourite fighter than are regulars at the Echo Arena in Liverpool, Wembley Stadium (where he appeared on the undercard of Froch-Groves II), or, infamously, the Glow Bluewater in Rotherhithe, the last of his six fights with Mick Hennessy.</p> <p>\u201cThose boos are for DeGale. He\u2019s not won too many friends here tonight,\u201d Sky Sports\u2019 Nick Halling told us at the end, when the winner dismissed the loser in the ring. The judges returned cards of varying approval: 117-111, 116-112, and a ludicrous 115-113 from the Bostonian John Madfis.</p> <p>\u201cHe kept coming,\u201d DeGale said at ringside. \u201cI don\u2019t know where he got that from. Got to give credit to him, he\u2019s tough, durable, game. But to be an elite fighter, you\u2019ve got to have more than that. The main thing is I\u2019m still the champ. We\u2019ll have to go back to the drawing board, me and Jim [McDonnell, his career-long trainer]. Learning curve, learning curve.\u201d</p> <p>Medina was no more than a short-armed, stubborn challenger and, with the exception of a few eye-catching haymakers, had not a clue how to profitably land his heavy fists on DeGale\u2019s artfully bobbing head or dodge his painful switch-hitting counters.</p> <p>Surely, though, an Olympic gold medallist who has lost only once and contentiously \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/may/22/james-degale-george-groves-boxing\" title=\"\">to George Groves six years ago</a>, an eternity away on that learning curve \u2013 and is so obviously a worthy champion should be performing in front of big home crowds against high-class opponents on pay-per-view.</p> <p>The problem for DeGale, an interesting, likeable and hugely talented boxer, is he doesn\u2019t often deliver the animal buzz fight fans crave. He coasted against Medina because his is such a natural talent. It was entertaining for admirers of nuance and trickery. There aren\u2019t many of those in the amorphous constituency that Hearn, Warren and Hennessy, the country\u2019s leading promoters, are trying to sell their product to.</p> <p>It is the market. And, like the global financial beast that rules all our lives, it is not fair. There is little DeGale can do about the way he wins fights, even as a respected and legitimate champion, because it works. It\u2019s business.</p> <p>His next business will be a unification against Badou Jack, who kept his title but looked hard done by getting a majority draw against Lucien Bute on the undercard. \u201cIt\u2019s a dirty business.\u201d Jack said. \u201cI don\u2019t blame Bute. I blame the judges.\u201d</p> <p>DeGale told Jack later: \u201cI want to box in Vegas, but will you come to London? I\u2019m easy, man.\u201d</p> <p>There was no response. Jack and DeGale knew one thing: in all probability, they will fight in the United States.</p> <p>At ringside was a ready-made British opponent in Callum Smith, who expressed his willingness to step up and fight DeGale, preferably in the UK. Will it happen? At some point. Meanwhile, DeGale will continue taking care of business ... a long way from home.</p> <h2>MEANWHILE ...</h2> <p>Restoring faith in the rough old trade, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/18/liam-walsh-boxing-interview\" title=\"\">the unbeaten Liam Walsh </a>delivered stout, doomed Troy James only his second loss at the Copper Box Arena in London on Saturday night, to secure the Lonsdale Belt and the British super-featherweight title. Walsh was punch-perfect; James was swinging all the way to the stoppage in round eight.</p> <p>Walsh\u2019s twin brother, Ryan, looked classy winning the British featherweight belt with repeated body shots that finally told for James Tennyson in the fifth.</p> <p>They were two of several good wars on the BoxNation bill, none better than a nailed-on fight-of-the-year contender between the Irishman Jamie Conlan and the unbeaten Commonwealth super-fly champion, Anthony Nelson. Conlan won a classic up-and-downer with a body shot in the eighth, but both suffered and prospered throughout.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Back in 2010, the Mental Health Foundation found that 18- to 34-year-olds were more lonely than the over 55s; last year the whole UK was found to be the \u201cloneliness capital of the European Union\u201d. In 2014, Esther Rantzen told us that children were facing an \u201cepidemic of loneliness\u201d, just like the elderly. And in a new report, the thinktank Demos says the capital is the loneliest place in Britain for older people. It does seem generally rather grim, especially down south. For anyone. Demos found that \u201c87% of over-55s have felt lonely at some point in the past 12 months\u201d. Well they would, wouldn\u2019t they? There\u2019s always going to be a day or two in a year when you fancy some company, but all your chums are unavailable on the same day, whatever age you are. So that\u2019s a bit of a pointless observation. Luckily for me, I don\u2019t get lonely, and nor does anyone of my age that I know. But we are the lucky ones; we have grandchildren, husbands, wives, children, chums, relatives, pleasant neighbours, we live in a bit of town where people say hello to each other. We\u2019re lucky because we\u2019re not ill or incapacitated, we\u2019re not on the breadline or below, and we\u2019re mobile. Some of us have a dog, can get out, speak to other dog people or anyone in the street \u2013 strangers, acquaintances, whatever. Well I do, probably a bit too much, to everyone, about the weather, the government, the dog\u2019s bowels, the state of the world, then I go home and wonder whether I should perhaps shut up sometimes. Then there\u2019s the telephone, the television, the radio, work, household tasks, visitors, and the days seem to wing by rather too quickly until I wish I could have more time alone, because fortunately for me, I like being on my own. Lots of people don\u2019t, and there seems to be no point advising someone lonely to get a dog, join a lunch club, ring a friend, take up a hobby, get out of the house and talk to their neighbours, because if they could, they probably would. My mother, who lived with me in her old age, was still often lonely, even in our house, with the dogs, granddaughter and visitors because all her own friends had dropped off their perches and at 98, she was the last one standing. She had no one left to talk to about the things she wanted to talk about. Who knows if she was ever lonely in the rest of her life. Her marriage wasn\u2019t exactly a breeze, my father was a terrible sulker, and a young married friend of mine once told me that she thought \u201cmarriage was organised loneliness\u201d. So loneliness can be a stinker of a problem, for anyone at any age, anywhere. It\u2019s perhaps more obvious in the elderly, because they are more often incapacitated, immobile and poor. And social media is no substitute for having a live person, whose company you like, in the room with you, having dinner and a laugh. And perhaps loneliness seems more acute in London or any big city, because it looks as if life is fizzing all around you, there are infinite possibilities out there, it should be easy to find someone or something, but it isn\u2019t. It all depends on what shape you\u2019re in, physically and emotionally. The Demos report \u2013 Building Companionship: how better design can combat loneliness in later life \u2013 suggests that \u201cpeople\u2019s surroundings play [a part] in shaping their levels of wellbeing\u201d. We need better housing design, modelled on \u201cthe sense of community found in retirement housing\u201d, to combat loneliness in the older generation. Quite right, and wouldn\u2019t it be lovely if that were to happen? But it won\u2019t, because we haven\u2019t enough houses to go round, never mind better designed ones for elderly people on a small income. All the places such people used to go for a bit of human contact are fast disappearing. Cuts to council budgets and small charities have ensured that many lunch clubs, day centres and cheaper, quieter places of entertainment have closed down. I started this piece thinking rather cockily that I and my friends are all right Jack. But one day, when we can no longer stride about with a dog any more, or cook, or travel to see each other, and we don\u2019t want our children babysitting us day after day, we too might be miserably lonely instead of happily alone. And I bet that by the time that happens, there\u2019ll be even less housing and fewer facilities to help us out. There used to be such a thing as society, so perhaps Demos can tell us how to get it back again.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "I don\u2019t think it will surprise you to read that there are some people who just seem to be naturally good at passing exams, and others who find them much more challenging. In my experience this isn\u2019t always simply due to being brainier or harder working (although, of course, these play a part). Very often it\u2019s simply down to technique; reading things carefully, knowing exactly what the exam question is asking, and what it is that the examiner wants to see in an answer. So as well as spending time learning all the different things in the curriculum for your exams, I think it is as important to make sure that your exam technique is a finely honed and sharp as possible. Believe me, I know. I\u2019ve spent many, many years of my life sitting exams! The first thing I want to reassure you of is that some stress is not at all a bad thing; that slight feeling of anxiety, a wave of nausea and nervous excitement that you feel flooding through your body when you think about your exams looming only a few short weeks away can be a good thing. It is often the motivator that makes you get off line, switch off the telly, and knuckle down to some revision. Not being stressed may make it very likely that you don\u2019t bother preparing or revising much at all, and this, to me, should be more of a concern than a degree of motivating stress. But I know that sometimes exam stresses can feel like they are getting out of hand, and you just don\u2019t think you will ever be able to cope with the mountains of work in front of you, the pressure from your teachers, and the anxious, hopeful, pleading expectation from your parents. Really extreme stress, that is causing you difficulties getting to sleep or waking up in the morning, unexplained aches and pains, poor appetite and headaches can adversely affect your performance and I advise you to talk to someone about it. But believe me, you can do this. To start with, let me suggest that you already know more than you think you do. You also know the bit you are not so good at, have never been good at, probably really don\u2019t like at all, (for me it was maths!) and it is these bits that you should spend a good amount of time on, not the bits you are good at and really enjoy. Don\u2019t overdo the revision; take breaks, go and get some fresh air. If you can get out everyday and do some exercise for an hour or so you will achieve wonders \u2013 far more than locking your self away in your room all day. Make sure you are getting enough sleep at night too, and not staying up late revising. It is during these times that your brain will go on processing and laying down what you have been studying as memories \u2013I would argue that the periods you spend not revising are as important as the times when you are. Don\u2019t worry about what other people are doing too much either. I remember some people at medical school announcing they had drawn up their revision timetables which involved a solid 12 hours of revision a day for the next four weeks. It made all of us worry that we weren\u2019t doing enough and it increased our anxiety massively. Should we all be doing that much? Shouldn\u2019t I be more worried \u2013 I wasn\u2019t planning on doing anything near that much! Don\u2019t listen or compare in this way. Do what you know works best for you. On the day before the exam, go through the final bits you always find tricky, read through your notes, have a look at some past papers and then STOP. Put everything away, and don\u2019t worry about it any more. You\u2019ve done it. You know it. It\u2019s in there, believe me. Desperately scanning through revision cards over breakfast the next morning or as you wait to go into your exam really wont make any difference. Some calm, and some respite is all you need now. One final thing; try your best to avoid going through the exam questions afterwards with your friends to see what they put. A post-mortem like this never helps. What\u2019s done is done. give yourself some time off, shake the dust off, stretch, and then start preparing for the next one. Believe me, they\u2019ll fly by, and get the work/life balance right and you may find you actually quite enjoyed your exams. Believe it or not, it is possible!

I\u2019ve spent many, many years of my life sitting exams!<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f9053682f79cf0db38bab87631fd03336ef2ee7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f9053682f79cf0db38bab87631fd03336ef2ee7/0_45_2104_1262/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Christian: exam expert!\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Christian: exam expert!</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Wright</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> The first thing I want to reassure you of is that some stress is not at all a bad thing; that slight feeling of anxiety, a wave of nausea and nervous excitement that you feel flooding through your body when you think about your exams looming only a few short weeks away can be a good thing. It is often the motivator that makes you get off line, switch off the telly, and knuckle down to some revision. Not being stressed may make it very likely that you don\u2019t bother preparing or revising much at all, and this, to me, should be more of a concern than a degree of motivating stress.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/feb/08/mental-health-ya-fiction-teenagers-speak-out\">Mental health and books: teenagers speak out</a> </p> </aside>  <p> But I know that sometimes exam stresses can feel like they are getting out of hand, and you just don\u2019t think you will ever be able to cope with the mountains of work in front of you, the pressure from your teachers, and the anxious, hopeful, pleading expectation from your parents. Really extreme stress, that is causing you difficulties getting to sleep or waking up in the morning, unexplained aches and pains, poor appetite and headaches can adversely affect your performance and I advise you to talk to someone about it.</p> <p> But believe me, you can do this. To start with, let me suggest that you already know more than you think you do. You also know the bit you are not so good at, have never been good at, probably really don\u2019t like at all, (for me it was maths!) and it is these bits that you should spend a good amount of time on, not the bits you are good at and really enjoy.</p> <p>Don\u2019t overdo the revision; take breaks, go and get some fresh air. If you can get out everyday and do some exercise for an hour or so you will achieve wonders \u2013 far more than locking your self away in your room all day. Make sure you are getting enough sleep at night too, and not staying up late revising. It is during these times that your brain will go on processing and laying down what you have been studying as memories \u2013I would argue that the periods you spend not revising are as important as the times when you are.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jan/19/the-teen-books-that-saved-my-life-blue-monday\">Authors and teenagers share the books that saved their life</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Don\u2019t worry about what other people are doing too much either. I remember some people at medical school announcing they had drawn up their revision timetables which involved a solid 12 hours of revision a day for the next four weeks. It made all of us worry that we weren\u2019t doing enough and it increased our anxiety massively. Should we all be doing that much? Shouldn\u2019t I be more worried \u2013 I wasn\u2019t planning on doing anything near that much! Don\u2019t listen or compare in this way. Do what you know works best for you.</p> <p>On the day before the exam, go through the final bits you always find tricky, read through your notes, have a look at some past papers and then STOP. Put everything away, and don\u2019t worry about it any more. You\u2019ve done it. You know it. It\u2019s in there, believe me. Desperately scanning through revision cards over breakfast the next morning or as you wait to go into your exam really wont make any difference. Some calm, and some respite is all you need now.</p> <p>One final thing; try your best to avoid going through the exam questions afterwards with your friends to see what they put. A post-mortem like this never helps. What\u2019s done is done. give yourself some time off, shake the dust off, stretch, and then start preparing for the next one. Believe me, they\u2019ll fly by, and get the work/life balance right and you may find you actually quite enjoyed your exams. Believe it or not, it is possible!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ef3dd832814bbd172dfc914cb8f4e2e1d06f18ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef3dd832814bbd172dfc914cb8f4e2e1d06f18ba/0_0_2125_2717/782.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Christian\u2019s Guide to You\" width=\"782\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Dr Christian\u2019s popular guides provide advice on problems facing children growing up from puberty and staying healthy to body image, bullying and staying safe online.</strong> <strong><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/393049/\">Buy Dr Christian\u2019s Guide to You at the Guardian bookshop</a>. </strong><br /></p>",

      "bodyText": "1) Wasps can\u2019t rely on dining off errors What a difference a week off makes. Exeter were refreshed after Wasps eliminated them from Europe while their opponents, after their defeat to Saracens, looked like wasps at the end of the summer: weary, woozy and wobbly. The rested Worcester and Newcastle stunned Leicester and Saracens respectively in the first-half of their games, but lacked the quality and know how to see it through. Exeter are a few cuts above and what was most impressive in a dominating performance from start to finish was the way they stuck to their strategy, never taking risks against the most dangerous breakaway side in England. Wasps feed off mistakes and the Chiefs made precious view, leaving the visitors to create off their own ball against a defence that throughout prevented ball-carriers getting into their stride. The two sides will meet in the play-offs if Wasps beat London Irish in the final round next weekend and Exeter pick up at least a point at Harlequins, but did the Chiefs reveal too much on Sunday? Back in 2014, Leicester won 22-16 at Northampton but six weeks later lost there in the play-off semi-final. To turn it around, Wasps would need to show more tactical flexibility; at this stage of the season they cannot rely on dining off errors. Paul Rees \u2022 Match report: Exeter 23-4 Wasps \u2022 Rob Andrew: the rebel who became the establishment\u2019s master of survival 2) London Irish can bounce back London Irish\u2019s gloomy season is not quite over \u2013 they have one last game this weekend against Wasps in Coventry \u2013 but any uncertainty about where they will play next season has been removed. The Exiles are now guaranteed to finish bottom of the pile and, with Bedford not about to overturn a huge first leg play-off deficit against Bristol, any prospect of a relegation reprieve has been removed. The rot set in early: they began the season poorly and improved too late to save themselves from dropping into the second tier for the first time since the game went professional. The good news is that Theo Brophy Clews is a young English player of obvious promise and Irish\u2019s academy is once again on the up. On the flip side they will be rattling around in the Madejski Stadium \u2013 it will be hard work attracting 9,000-plus crowds to Reading to watch Championship rugby \u2013 and must now rebuild again at precisely the moment they were looking to kick on to the next level. A big decision, in particular, will have to be made regarding the future of their director of rugby, Tom Coventry. The New Zealander responded with admirable dignity to the inevitable post-match questions but his introduction to the dog-eat-dog world of English club rugby has been a rough one. There are some interesting alternatives out there \u2013 Stuart Lancaster, anyone? - although Harlequins\u2019 Conor O\u2019Shea reckons the key to the Exiles\u2019 revival should involve a measure of continuity. \u201cThey can bounce back if they stick together,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they do that they won\u2019t have an issue because they\u2019ll be too strong for everyone in the league. Hopefully their senior leaders will lead them through.\u201d Robert Kitson \u2022 Match report: London Irish 25-32 Harlequins 3) Burger remains a totem of Sarries\u2019 charge for honours As ever at this time of year, the talking point was whether a trophy should be awarded to the team who finishes top of the table, despite that feat not earning them the title of champions. Mark McCall was circumspect on the matter. The only time Saracens have been champions in the past four seasons is the only time they haven\u2019t finished top of the table (although they may reverse that trend this time). Others feel strongly that the achievement should be marked in some way. A personal view is not to bother. Either the champion team is the one who finishes top or it\u2019s not. At the moment, it\u2019s not. Meanwhile, as Saracens pursue trophies on two fronts over the next month, Jacques Burger, the battered warrior who took his leave on Sunday, will remain as a non-kitted-up John Terry figure. He returns home to Namibia at the end of June and has a couple of operations lined up before he goes, just to smooth over the damage wrought by so valiant a career in rugby. \u201cWords can\u2019t portray the value he\u2019s brought us,\u201d said McCall, \u201cand they don\u2019t. You guys just see Jacques Burger, the bravest and toughest rugby player there is. But you don\u2019t know what he went through to be able to play again [because of his ruined right knee]. It\u2019s kind of inspirational to know, the hours and hours he went through in these ice machines for two years. It\u2019s important to understand why this is his last game. He\u2019s having to take pain killers just to be able to train. It\u2019s not right. We felt today was the right time.\u201d Michael Aylwin \u2022 Match report: Saracens 23-14 Newcastle \u2022 Farrell gets two-game ban but can play in Champions Cup final 4) Warriors need to carry more menace with the ball Worcester achieved their goal of staying in the Premiership more than a month ago, a welcome change after seasons of struggle in the top flight this decade, but a 10th defeat in 10 league visits to Leicester showed what they need if they are to follow Exeter\u2019s example and challenge for a place in the top, rather than the bottom, four. The Warriors were strong and resourceful in the set-pieces, predatory at the breakdown and gave the Tigers little time on the ball. They overcame the loss of two forwards in the first 33 minutes and led three times during the first half, but in a season that has been hallmarked by the increasing ability of teams to make better use of possession, they were considerably more effective without the ball rather than with it, although Andy Symons had his moments in the centre. Francois Hougaard has made a notable difference at scrum-half, but the Warriors could do with a stand-out stand-off, something they have never had in their 10 seasons in the top flight. Paul Rees \u2022 Match report: Leicester 31-17 Worcester 5) Hartley\u2019s Northampton absence a concern for Jones While drama was not in short supply at Franklin\u2019s Gardens, quality most certainly was. This contest was a damning indictment of how these sides, who finished first and second last year, have regressed. Early in the second half there was a farcical period of play, where error followed error and knock-on followed knock-on; neither side able to show any sort of composure. Eddie Jones, watching in the crowd, cannot have been impressed and while he will have been with Teimana Harrison\u2019s performance, the continued absence of Dylan Hartley will be of greater concern. Hartley has not trained with Saints\u2019s first string since suffering a dreadful-looking concussion against France in March. Jim Mallinder all but admitted that even if he had, such is Mike Haywood\u2019s form that Hartley would still not be starting and it seems highly unlikely the England captain will get the nod for Saints\u2019 final match of the season against Gloucester. Jones has demonstrated that when it comes to Hartley, form is not everything \u2013 Haywood was outshining his team-mate when Jones took the reins at Twickenham and Saracens\u2019 Jamie George was the Premiership\u2019s stand-out hooker \u2013 but Hartley has started only six matches for Northampton this season. Haywood is of course English and is likely to tour with the Saxons this summer but Jones does not want a situation where his captain is consistently reduced to cameos for his club.

      "bodyText": "Welcome back to our ongoing effort to demystify cryptic clueing and entice the cautious but curious to crosswords based on wordplay. A quick reminder that a cryptic clue typically has a definition of the answer (either at its beginning or its end and indicated in bold below), and a little recipe for the letters that spell out that answer. (The names of the setters whose clues are cited generally link to Q&amp;As, if you want to try to get inside the head of each.) A neat way of giving that recipe is to use abbreviations that can be combined or meddled with, and so solvers get to know the lingo used in various areas of life that have a lot of abbreviations. The British army, for example. The most important thing you need to know \u2013 and the soldier that you encounter most often when solving \u2013 is the GI. This priapic nylons-sporting visitor might be history now, and it\u2019s of at least mild interest to note that the letters may have originally stood for \u201cgalvanized iron\u201d rather than \u201cgovernment issue\u201d, but all the solver needs to remember is that \u201csoldier\u201d in a clue might indicate GI in the answer. Here\u2019s Paul: 13ac Musical soldiers (4) [ abbrev. for a soldier, twice ] It\u2019s \u201csoldiers\u201d plural here, so you take GI twice and you\u2019ve got yourself the title of a Lerner/Loewe musical, GIGI. Not so hard, is it? Except that it\u2019s not always that simple ... ... in the military, or in cryptic clueing. If GI gets you nowhere, perhaps the setter has some other soldiers in mind. Here\u2019s Crucible: 19ac Blunt character soldiers follow? (7) [ synonym for \u2018character\u2019, \u2018followed\u2019 by abbrev. for some \u2018soldiers\u2019 ] [ TRAIT followed by OR ] These soldiers are the Other Ranks, abbreviated to OR and whacked after TRAIT to give such a TRAITOR as (Anthony) Blunt. Oh yes, and those soldiers might also indicate the letters NCO (non-commissioned officers) as part of ENCORE, INCOME or indeed COMMON COLD. Those in the higher ranks tend to be clued with the more respectful \u201cofficer\u201d, and the one to keep in mind is the colonel. Nutmeg: 16ac Officer slow to check everything\u2019s in order (7) [ abbrev. for an \u2018officer\u2019 + synonym for \u2018late\u2019 ] [ COL + LATE ] And that\u2019s it. Oh, except that of course, \u201csoldiers\u201d might equally indicate a corps. Here\u2019s Rufus: 1ac To fall back, a mistake made by soldiers (7) [ synonym for \u2018mistake\u2019 after (\u2018by\u2019) abbrev. for \u2018Royal Engineers\u2019 (\u2018soldiers\u2019) ] [ RE + LAPSE ] The RE\u2019s colleagues in the Regiment of Artillery, by the way, tend to be clued by \u201cgunners\u201d, requiring an RA. And that really is it. Um, except to say that since \u201cmen\u201d is a way of referring to soldiers, \u201cmen\u201d in a clue might be doing the same job, or MEN might be part of the answer to a clue describing military matters, except that \u201cmen\u201d might also have something to do with chessmen (which we\u2019ll return to). Ah yes, and thanks to the existence of the existence of belligerent termites, \u201csoldier\u201d might also mean something that\u2019s not even a person. Here\u2019s Paul again ... 6d Soldier shackling a young rogue, one solving others\u2019 problems? (5,4) [ what a \u2018soldier\u2019 might be, going around (\u2018shackling\u2019) an anagram (\u2018rogue\u2019) of AYOUNG ] [ ANT around GONYAU ] ... with a clue for AGONY AUNT which uses \u201csoldier\u201d, like other puzzles use \u201cworker\u201d, to give ANT.

Now, displaying either a brass-balled disregard for his critics or a mulish inability to understand their complaints, the movie\u2019s Australian director Bruce Beresford has made another film in which a saintly black servant teaches the white folks how to live. In his first film role for four years, Eddie Murphy plays Mr Church with quiet dignity on full blast but his crackling charisma turned down to zero. Mr Church is a cook who\u2019s been appointed to look after Marie, played by Natascha McElhone, and her 10-year-old daughter Charlotte (Natalie Coughlin), by Marie\u2019s deceased, rich former lover. The bratty Charlotte throws a tantrum, demanding Apple Jacks cereal rather than Mr Church\u2019s extravagant steak, eggs and grits (for breakfast \u2013 the fact that the characters aren\u2019t all built like the Michelin man being one of the film\u2019s unrealistic elements), but is soon won over by both Mr Church\u2019s cooking and his collection of literary classics, which he lends to her from his personal library. Marie is suffering from breast cancer, but outlives her diagnosis by several years, long enough to see her daughter \u2013 now a less objectionable teenager played by Britt Robertson \u2013 get taken to her first prom. By this time Mr Church is part of the family unit, though he\u2019s still waiting on the pair hand and foot from morning until night and calling Marie \u201cma\u2019am\u201d. What he does in his extracurricular time becomes an object of fascination for Charlotte, especially since Mr Church won\u2019t tell. Sadly for the viewers, by night Mr Church doesn\u2019t turn out to be a cat burglar, habitue of S&amp;M sex dungeons or \u2013 better still \u2013 a revolutionary plotting to bring about the violent downfall of white America. Instead he just enjoys going to Jellys, a supposedly seedy jazz club, and having a skinful \u2013 and with such a lack of agency in the rest of his life, no wonder. Set in the 70s, Mr Church mercilessly trades in cliches \u2013 for instance, Charlotte\u2019s former schoolfriend turns into a rich-bitch fashion designer, her extravagant lifestyle failing to make up for the fact that she can\u2019t have children. There\u2019s also a fairytale subplot involving the salvation of the local drunk. Yet it\u2019s the film\u2019s racial politics, particularly its stereotypical evocation of willing servitude by an African-American, and its characters\u2019 refusal to acknowledge this imbalance of power, which make it not so much old-fashioned as downright retrograde \u2013 and likely to go down even worse with black audiences than Driving Miss Daisy.",

After that, he lost me in a flurry of bad voiceovers, visual overload and slack dramatics.

As a story of disillusionment in Hollywood concealing a visual mash note to Los Angeles, Knight Of Cups reminds me most of The Loved One, that 1965 black-and-white hate letter to LA, which in its choice of locations and its superlative cinematography ended up loving as much as it despised.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As the world celebrates the 400th anniversary of his death, battle lines are quietly being drawn in the world of Shakespeare scholarship over the text of King Lear. The Bard\u2019s great tragedy exists in two versions, the 1608 Quarto and the 1623 Folio, each of which is abridged. The Quarto is missing 100 lines that appear in the Folio, and the Folio lacking 300 lines found in the Quarto. The texts were combined as one version in editions of the play for centuries, until a revisionist movement in the 1980s argued that Shakespeare had shortened the Folio text himself, and that the two texts represented two versions of the play. The two-text version has since become the orthodoxy. But a new book from Shakespeare scholar Sir Brian Vickers argues that this is wrong. In The One King Lear, Vickers argues that the cuts in the Quarto text were made by the printer, who had underestimated how much paper he would need to print the play. He says that there is no evidence the Folio text was cut by Shakespeare, arguing that the changes were likely to have been made by the theatre company to speed up the action, rather than by the playwright to adjust focus. \u201cThe unique thing about Lear is that the cuts in the Quarto and in the Folio occur in different places, so the two physically interlock perfectly. For 300 years, people just took the bits which were missing from one, and put them in the other, and everyone was happy,\u201d said Vickers, who is a senior fellow at the School of Advanced Study, University of London. \u201cBut in the 70s, people were trying to overthrow the assumptions and attitudes of previous generations, and to overthrow what they thought to be orthodoxies.\u201d However, the cuts to the Folio that the revisionists believe were made by Shakespeare are actually \u201cquite damaging\u201d to the play, according to Vickers. The cuts include lines from the scene on the heath, when a mad Lear is imagining that Goneril and Regan are present, and act four, scene three, in which Kent meets a gentleman who tells him of Cordelia\u2019s grief. Kent reveals the king\u2019s state of mind to the gentleman: \u201cburning shame / Detains him from Cordelia\u201d. \u201cThe revisionists said we don\u2019t really need this scene, that it\u2019s not important \u2013 that we\u2019d much rather see Lear than hear what\u2019s said about him,\u201d said Vickers. \u201c[But] it\u2019s a very important scene which shows he\u2019s now aware of what he did. Shakespeare deliberately wrote the scene to prepare for what follows, it\u2019s a very tightly written scene with not a word wasted [and to cut it] is an act of mutilation.\u201d Vickers said he hoped his new book would put paid to the revisionists\u2019 perspective on the text. UCL English professor John Mullan predicted that it would certainly prove divisive. \u201cI imagine battle will be joined,\u201d he said. \u201cThe excitement of the revisionist theory was that for the first time, we could see evidence of Shakespeare at work \u2026 The thought was that if you looked at the variations for the Folio and the Quarto you would be able to see the genius at work. It absolutely became the orthodoxy. I accepted it and I\u2019ve been teaching Lear that way for decades \u2026 But Brian is very convincing and it will be interesting to hear what others say in return.\u201d Professor Ren\u00e9 Weis, an expert in the life and work of Shakespeare, edited a parallel text version of Lear in 1993 but followed it with a new edition in 2010 that argued that the variants between the texts \u201ctell a story of convergence rather than disjunction\u201d. Weis said that Vickers\u2019s new book made a compelling case. \u201cHe is a formidable scholar and this book will undoubtedly make waves and cause us to think again about the text \u2013 or texts \u2013 of Shakespeare\u2019s greatest play,\u201d he said. \u201cIf nothing else it will re-energise the debate around a play that has come to mean so much to so many: Keats\u2019s favourite play, Vickers\u2019s (he says so in his preface), mine too \u2013 and also, I know, of many of the scholars and editors who gave us the two King Lears.\u201d Professor Gary Taylor, a prime mover in the revisionist movement and editor of the influential The Division of the Kingdoms in 1983, said his forthcoming New Oxford Shakespeare edition of Shakespeare\u2019s complete works would not be \u201cblindly following the scholarship of the 1980s, in this or in any other respect\u201d. \u201cThe New Oxford Shakespeare will not personalise or polemicise the ongoing scholarly debates about Shakespeare\u2019s texts,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cWe sometimes agree with Brian; we sometimes do not. He has little experience editing Shakespeare, and few credentials as a bibliographer or book historian; but we will take seriously any book published by Harvard University Press.\u201d",

For 300 years, people just took the bits which were missing from one, and put them in the other, and everyone was happy,\u201d said Vickers, who is a senior fellow at the School of Advanced Study, University of London. \u201cBut in the 70s, people were trying to overthrow the assumptions and attitudes of previous generations, and to overthrow what they thought to be orthodoxies.\u201d</p> <p>However, the cuts to the Folio that the revisionists believe were made by Shakespeare are actually \u201cquite damaging\u201d to the play, according to Vickers. The cuts include lines from the scene on the heath, when a mad Lear is imagining that Goneril and Regan are present, and act four, scene three, in which Kent meets a gentleman who tells him of Cordelia\u2019s grief. Kent reveals the king\u2019s state of mind to the gentleman: \u201cburning shame / Detains him from Cordelia\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe revisionists said we don\u2019t really need this scene, that it\u2019s not important \u2013 that we\u2019d much rather see Lear than hear what\u2019s said about him,\u201d said Vickers. \u201c[But] it\u2019s a very important scene which shows he\u2019s now aware of what he did. Shakespeare deliberately wrote the scene to prepare for what follows, it\u2019s a very tightly written scene with not a word wasted [and to cut it] is an act of mutilation.\u201d</p> <p>Vickers said he hoped his new book would put paid to the revisionists\u2019 perspective on the text.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The excitement of the revisionist theory was that for the first time, we could see evidence of Shakespeare at work</p> <footer> <cite>Professor John Mullan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>UCL English professor John Mullan predicted that it would certainly prove divisive. \u201cI imagine battle will be joined,\u201d he said. \u201cThe excitement of the revisionist theory was that for the first time, we could see evidence of Shakespeare at work \u2026 The thought was that if you looked at the variations for the Folio and the Quarto you would be able to see the genius at work. It absolutely became the orthodoxy. I accepted it and I\u2019ve been teaching Lear that way for decades \u2026 But Brian is very convincing and it will be interesting to hear what others say in return.\u201d</p> <p>Professor Ren\u00e9 Weis, an expert in the life and work of Shakespeare, edited a parallel text version of Lear in 1993 but followed it with a new edition in 2010 that argued that the variants between the texts \u201ctell a story of convergence rather than disjunction\u201d.</p> <p>Weis said that Vickers\u2019s new book made a compelling case. \u201cHe is a formidable scholar and this book will undoubtedly make waves and cause us to think again about the text \u2013 or texts \u2013 of Shakespeare\u2019s greatest play,\u201d he said. \u201cIf nothing else it will re-energise the debate around a play that has come to mean so much to so many: Keats\u2019s favourite play, Vickers\u2019s (he says so in his preface), mine too \u2013 and also, I know, of many of the scholars and editors who gave us the two King Lears.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/23/shakespeare-crime-writer-today-roy-grace-peter-james\">If Shakespeare was writing today, he'd be a crime writer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Professor Gary Taylor, a prime mover in the revisionist movement and editor of the influential The Division of the Kingdoms in 1983, said his forthcoming New Oxford Shakespeare edition of Shakespeare\u2019s complete works would not be \u201cblindly following the scholarship of the 1980s, in this or in any other respect\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe New Oxford Shakespeare will not personalise or polemicise the ongoing scholarly debates about Shakespeare\u2019s texts,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cWe sometimes agree with Brian; we sometimes do not. He has little experience editing Shakespeare, and few credentials as a bibliographer or book historian; but we will take seriously any book published by Harvard University Press.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Looking at the Twitter explosion after the first episode of Sex Box aired on Channel 4 it seemed that many Brits were shocked to learn that some people wanted to come on television to have sex in a box and talk about their sex lives. I will admit that it\u2019s not for everyone, but for some of them, going into the box added a sort of frisson to the entire experience. Which isn\u2019t surprising \u2013 it\u2019s not unusual for us to find arousal in unlikely places. For others, the box was a reason for them to have a conversation about trying something different or new together for the first time. And though that may sound scary, it wasn\u2019t really. I was always there to talk each couple through their experience, offering any tips and advice as and when they needed it. I am not surprised that some viewers have responded with shock after watching the programme. It\u2019s not your average TV show, is it? Even if you don\u2019t see what they are doing, you know what\u2019s going on in there, and for some just that thought is too much to cope with. We have created an atmosphere of guilt and shame surrounding sex in our society. This makes it difficult for people to embrace open, honest conversations about it and also has in some cases hindered our desires to experiment and try new things or even speak out about things we really don\u2019t enjoy. This is not only a sad reality, but it can also be very damaging. When it comes to sex, one has to make informed decisions and also know one\u2019s own boundaries. But there\u2019s no way for one to do that unless one has the skills to do this. And that\u2019s what Sex Box is all about. By having this conversation openly on television, we aim to empower people to start having these conversations with their partners, and to say without shame, or fear of judgment: \u201cI don\u2019t want this or I don\u2019t enjoy that, but I would love to try this \u2026 if you wanted to?\u201d While we\u2019re here, let me take this opportunity to debunk some sexual myths. First, you do not need to have a hugely adventurous sex life to have good sex. And having a good time with your partner isn\u2019t just something for young adults either \u2013 sex should be a happy, funny, enjoyable experience for all. Whether that means rushing to the kitchen for some heated table sex, or indulging in a scheduled 7am missionary session in bed. Some of the tasks that I give to people in the programme are to simply find each other\u2019s pleasure points (also known as erogenous zones). This is a game of exploration. The body is jam-packed with areas that make us feel great, but many don\u2019t know where they are, and that\u2019s a pity. As you\u2019ll see on the programme, this pleasure-point search can be done in many different fun and playful ways. I have a show in Holland where couples do similar tasks or exercises, but they do them at home in private and then they come back to see me and we talk about their experience. The difference between Sex Box and that show is that once they\u2019ve finished their experience, the couples come out and talk about what\u2019s happened and how it was for them. We felt it was important to do this straight away, to ensure that people don\u2019t clam up and try to hide their true feelings about what they\u2019ve just tried for the first time. Being able to talk openly about sex is empowering. In my opinion, one of the biggest things in life is to find out what you do and don\u2019t like sexually, And it\u2019s important to be able to share this with a partner. If you feel shamed and guilty about talking about this, then you won\u2019t be able to express your feelings and be clear about what you don\u2019t want, or indeed do. I have been a sexologist for many years, and I\u2019ve seen otherwise healthy relationships breaking down because the pair weren\u2019t on the same page sexually. Occasionally this was an unfixable issue, but in many others it was a communication problem. I hope that Sex Box has encouraged many discussions about sex and about the things that people enjoy doing, and don\u2019t enjoy doing, and the things that people want to try, and those they definitely don\u2019t. How can you have a good sex life if you don\u2019t know what you like yourself or even what your partner likes? For me, I want the series to be educational but also entertaining. Hopefully this creates a warm environment for those coming on to the show, as well as the viewers at home watching it. It\u2019s not glamorised or fictionalised, it\u2019s honest. Our bodies are capable of producing amazing euphoric sensations \u2013 so why wouldn\u2019t we revel in that pleasure rather than shy away from it?",

I will admit that it\u2019s not for everyone, but for some of them, going into the box added a sort of frisson to the entire experience. Which isn\u2019t surprising \u2013 it\u2019s not unusual for us to find arousal in unlikely places.</p> <p>For others, the box was a reason for them to have a conversation about trying something different or new together for the first time. And though that may sound scary, it wasn\u2019t really. I was always there to talk each couple through their experience, offering any tips and advice as and when they needed it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/16/have-sex-same-person-rest-life-keep-exciting-bedroom-work\">How to have sex with the same person for the rest of your life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I am not surprised that some viewers have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/24/normal-sex-box-channel-4\" title=\"\">responded with shock</a> after watching the programme. It\u2019s not your average TV show, is it? Even if you don\u2019t see what they are doing, you know what\u2019s going on in there, and for some just that thought is too much to cope with.</p> <p>We have created an atmosphere of guilt and shame surrounding sex in our society. This makes it difficult for people to embrace open, honest conversations about it and also has in some cases hindered our desires to experiment and try new things or even speak out about things we really don\u2019t enjoy. This is not only a sad reality, but it can also be very damaging.</p> <p>When it comes to sex, one has to make informed decisions and also know one\u2019s own boundaries. But there\u2019s no way for one to do that unless one has the skills to do this. And that\u2019s what Sex Box is all about. By having this conversation openly on television, we <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/29/sex-box-is-inspirational\" title=\"\">aim to empower people</a> to start having these conversations with their partners, and to say without shame, or fear of judgment: \u201cI don\u2019t want this or I don\u2019t enjoy that, but I would love to try this \u2026 if you wanted to?\u201d</p> <p>While we\u2019re here, let me take this opportunity to debunk some sexual myths. First, you do not need to have a hugely adventurous sex life to have good sex. And having a good time with your partner isn\u2019t just something for young adults either \u2013 sex should be a happy, funny, enjoyable experience for all. Whether that means rushing to the kitchen for some heated table sex, or indulging in a scheduled 7am missionary session in bed. Some of the tasks that I give to people in the programme are to simply find each other\u2019s pleasure points (also known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/07/neuroscientists-sex-brain\" title=\"\">erogenous zones</a>). This is a game of exploration. The body is jam-packed with areas that make us feel great, but many don\u2019t know where they are, and that\u2019s a pity. As you\u2019ll see on the programme, this pleasure-point search can be done in many different fun and playful ways.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How can you have a good sex life if you don\u2019t know what you like yourself or even what your partner likes?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I have a show in Holland where couples do similar tasks or exercises, but they do them at home in private and then they come back to see me and we talk about their experience. The difference between Sex Box and that show is that once they\u2019ve finished their experience, the couples come out and talk about what\u2019s happened and how it was for them. We felt it was important to do this straight away, to ensure that people don\u2019t clam up and try to hide their true feelings about what they\u2019ve just tried for the first time.</p> <p>Being able to talk openly about sex is empowering. In my opinion, one of the biggest things in life is to find out what you do and don\u2019t like sexually, And it\u2019s important to be able to share this with a partner. If you feel shamed and guilty about talking about this, then you won\u2019t be able to express your feelings and be clear about what you don\u2019t want, or indeed do.</p> <p>I have been a sexologist for many years, and I\u2019ve seen otherwise healthy relationships breaking down because the pair weren\u2019t on the same page sexually. Occasionally this was an unfixable issue, but in many others it was a communication problem.</p> <p>I hope that Sex Box has encouraged many discussions about sex and about the things that people enjoy doing, and don\u2019t enjoy doing, and the things that people want to try, and those they definitely don\u2019t. How can you have a good sex life if you don\u2019t know what you like yourself or even what your partner likes?</p> <p>For me, I want the series to be educational but also entertaining. Hopefully this creates a warm environment for those coming on to the show, as well as the viewers at home watching it. It\u2019s not glamorised or fictionalised, it\u2019s honest. Our bodies are capable of producing amazing euphoric sensations \u2013 so why wouldn\u2019t we revel in that pleasure rather than shy away from it?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gillian Martin, the SNP\u2019s candidate for Aberdeenshire East, was one of the thousands of Scots to become politically active during the 2014 referendum campaign and joined the party in the defiant membership surge that followed the no vote to independence in September of that year. Martin headed her local branch of Women for Independence, one of the most influential grassroots organisations to emerge from the referendum and which has since carved out a permanent position in Scottish civic society, campaigning on a range of issues, including successfully opposing the building of a women\u2019s super-prison last year. No less than seven of its current committee members are candidates for this election, although not all for the SNP. Martin is clear about the usefulness of coming to candidacy through a non-traditional route: \u201cIt was not so much my idea but other people seeing something in me when I was campaigning for the referendum\u201d. \u201cI bring three main things: my experience of being a working mum, working in further education for the last 15 years, and running a production business. I\u2019m 47 so I\u2019ve done a fair number of things.\u201d On the Aberdeenshire doorstep, she says, people are concerned about infrastructure, affordable housing, and, of course, the oil industry and need for diversification of businesses. Despite regular polling predictions that SNP candidates will be successful in almost all constituency contests. Martin\u2019s first experience of election campaigning has not been without incident. A personal blog in which she used colourful language to describe both the royal family and the former SNP leader and MSP for her constituency, Alex Salmond, attracted substantial criticism after it appeared in the press. \u201cI wrote the blog for 10 years and nobody was offended [until I stood as a candidate],\u201d she points out. \u201cIt was a humour blog and things were taken out of context. But I think I\u2019ve had more support because of it, with people contacting me because they\u2019ve gone back and read the blog.\u201d She\u2019s cautiously optimistic about the potential for a fresh cohort of non-traditional, and female, faces in the Holyrood chamber, in particular with a number of SNP stalwarts standing down at the end of the recent term: \u201cI do find it exciting. I know a lot of these women already and it\u2019s good to think we might be in a gang.\u201d For Richard Leonard, Scottish Labour\u2019s candidate for Airdrie and Shotts, his reasons for standing are simple enough. \u201cI stood because I thought more of the same wouldn\u2019t do and that we needed people in Holyrood with experience of representing working people, and with the energy for winning elections but also for winning the battle of ideas with nationalism. We need to stop dividing people on the basis of nationality and start uniting them on the basis of class.\u201d Leonard, a highly respected GMB official for nearly two decades, was one of the beneficiaries after new leader, Kezia Dugdale, forced through an open selection process that meant sitting MSPs had to compete for places on the regional list alongside new candidates. The former chair of the Scottish Labour executive now heads the Central list, having been voted by members above several sitting Holyrood members. (For clarity: each voter in the Scottish parliamentary elections has two votes, a constituency vote to elect 73 MSPs in first-past-the-post contests and a regional list vote to elect 56 more from eight regions, selected proportionately. With polling consistently placing the SNP at around 50%. the nationalists are expected to win the majority of constituency seats, while the proportional system is expected to allocate more regional list seats to Scottish Labour and the Tories, who are locked in a battle for second place, as well as to smaller parties, like the Scottish Greens, who are hoping to overtake the Liberal Democrats for the first time.) Despite further back-and-forth at the weekend regarding the timing of a second independence referendum, Leonard insists that this is not an issue he sees reflected on the doorstep: \u201cThere\u2019s a real desire to look forward.\u201d \u201cPeople can see for themselves what is happening to local services, and they see the need for an alternative to cuts\u201d - and, naturally, he hopes that this will be Scottish Labour\u2019s alternative, funded by tax rises for those who can afford it. But Leonard is well aware of the challenge his party currently faces in Scotland, after its near wipe-out in last May\u2019s general election. \u201cI am picking up that people who voted SNP in 2015 as a protest are considering voting for Labour this time. But we\u2019ve got to recognise that we have to work to clinch that return. There has been some movement back and there is also a degree of disillusionment with the SNP beginning to set in.\u201d But he accepts that this may not take effect swiftly enough to sway this Thursday\u2019s election result. In the final days of campaigning, he says, it\u2019s about \u201cmaking sure the message goes out that there is a real choice in this election\u201d. According to Alex Cole-Hamilton, who is standing for the Scottish Liberal Democrats in Edinburgh Western, an SNP tsunami taking practically all constituencies \u2013 as seen in last May\u2019s general election \u2013 is far from inevitable. Across the country, his party is struggling with the twin liabilities of their Westminster coalition with the Tories plus their ill-starred association with the Tories and Labour during the referendum, and face being shunted into fourth place behind the Scottish Greens. An activist for 17 years, Cole-Hamilton first stood \u2013 unsuccessfully - for Holyrood five years ago, but this time believes that he has one crucial factor working in his favour. With so many voters seemingly content to trust the SNP with power for another term, he insists that locally faith in the nationalists has been eroded by Michelle Thomson, his constituency\u2019s Westminster representative, who withdrew from the SNP whip last September after being linked to possible mortgage fraud. Thomson denies any wrongdoing and a police investigation is ongoing. \u201cWhen the received wisdom is that the SNP are going to sweep the board, voters can feel there\u2019s no point,\u201d says Cole-Hamilton. \u201cBut we are finding enthusiasm here because there is a real belief that we can unseat the SNP, and people feel their vote can count and make a difference.\u201dHe points out that this constituency returned one of the largest no votes in the country, while Thompson won by majority of only a few thousand last May. Meanwhile, his SNP opponent, the former Yes Scotland staffer Toni Giugliano, argues that Cole-Hamilton is unfairly focusing on an individual who is not even standing, and observers have described this as one of the sharper contests of the campaign. But Cole-Hamilton, who works for a children\u2019s charity, is unrepentant: \u201cIt will be terrible for democracy for the SNP to win a super-majority again.\u201d It\u2019s always worth remembering that it wasn\u2019t only independence supporters who were drawn into political activism by the referendum. Annie Wells, the Scottish Conservative candidate for Glasgow Provan, got involved with the pro-union campaign Better Together, when she says her notions of \u2018what a Tory is\u2019 were blown away. \u201cI\u2019d never related to being a Tory, and I came from a working class family,\u201d explains Wells, who lives in the north east of Glasgow with her son and works as a manager at Marks and Spencer. Despite that, Wells - who is ranked second on her party\u2019s Glasgow regional list - is in a strong position to find herself elected as a Tory MSP by the end of the week, if polling predictions hold. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got someone like me chapping your door and saying \u2018I\u2019m a Tory\u2019 people can see the party has changed,\u201d says Wells, although she will admit that convincing people that \u201cthey\u2019re not voting for David Cameron and George Osborne\u201d is still the hardest challenge to overcome on the doorstep. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about being political and knowing everything about every single policy,\u201d she insists, with admirable honestly. \u201cIt\u2019s about people being able to relate to you: you\u2019re a single parent, you\u2019ve struggled. I believe the time has come for people like me to stand up.\u201d Zara Kitson, the Scottish Green party\u2019s second list candidate for Glasgow, joined the party in 2011: \u201cAt my first meeting I was the only person under 40\u201d. Another Women for Independence committee member, she was active throughout the referendum campaign but says it is the post-referendum also surge enjoyed by the Greens that has completely changed the dynamics of this Holyrood campaign for her. After a five-fold increase in membership, bringing with it people, money and energy, \u201cthe difference is amazing\u201d says Kitson. \u201cPeople have always liked the Greens but not felt able to vote for them before\u201d. \u201cThey also recognise that Labour has not managed to recover in this election, and that we can work with anyone who shares our aims. Particularly after his performance in the referendum campaign, people see Patrick [Harvie, party co-convenor] as a constructive and sensible voice.\u201d Having cut her teeth on previous campaigns, this is Kitson\u2019s first Holyrood election and one she is in with a shout of winning, coming second on the Glasgow regional list behind Harvie. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to be the person standing up there. I\u2019m not from a family that was political at all. When I\u2019ve not had any lunch, or have no time to spend with my girlfriend, I do ask myself why am I choosing this? But the reason is that there aren\u2019t many voices like mine in politics.\u201d She adds: \u201cWe need those fresh voices to make people reflect that they are in an institution like any other. We hear a lot about the institution of Westminster but those dangers of becoming entrenched are all there for Holyrood too.\u201d Trade union activist Cat Boyd, lead candidate for the left alliance party RISE on the Glasgow list, likewise has no plans to become institutionalised. Rise, which stands for respect, independence, socialism, environmentalism, claims to represent a united Scottish left for the first time in decades, and launched its manifesto last month with a vision of a Trident-free independent Scottish republic achieved via a second referendum within the life of the next parliament. It was formed out of Radical Independence - which Boyd co-founded and was another successful element of the grassroots yes movement - and the more established Scottish Socialist party (SSP), once led by Tommy Sheridan. While there has been much discussion of tactically using the second vote -particularly amongst yes supporters who want a more varied, but pro-independence, parliament - Boyd says that on the doorstep people are still more concerned with how the voting system operates. \u201cI think that tactical voting is a big discussion in the media but at a campaign level a lot of people aren\u2019t sure how it actually works.\u201d Boyd is clear that Rise remains \u201ca project in its infancy\u201d, and one without a huge budget. Nonetheless, she adds: \u201cI know everyone says this but when we\u2019re able to speak face to face to people they really like our ideas.\u201d Voters have been particularly interested in Rise\u2019s alternative to the council tax, as well as plans for a living income for carers, she reports. Although Boyd was familiar a degree of public recognition from her referendum campaigning, she admits that standing as an election candidate has been a difficult transition. \u201cFor a person from a very small party, a lot of my life has had a large amount of attention. But there has to come a moment when you put your ego to the side and commit yourself.\u201d \u201cI think because I am a woman in the public eye and not frightened to say things that are unpopular, a lot of it comes from the idea that \u2018you should know your place\u2019.\u201d",

There has been some movement back and there is also a degree of disillusionment with the SNP beginning to set in.\u201d But he accepts that this may not take effect swiftly enough to sway this Thursday\u2019s election result. </p> <p>In the final days of campaigning, he says, it\u2019s about \u201cmaking sure the message goes out that there is a real choice in this election\u201d.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/agcolehamilton\">Alex Cole-Hamilton</a>, who is standing for the Scottish Liberal Democrats in Edinburgh Western, an SNP tsunami taking practically all constituencies \u2013 as seen in last May\u2019s general election \u2013 is far from inevitable. </p> <p>Across the country, his party is struggling with the twin liabilities of their Westminster coalition with the Tories plus their ill-starred association with the Tories and Labour during the referendum, and face being shunted into fourth place behind the Scottish Greens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"@adamstachura\" data-alt=\"@adamstachura\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The odds on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/agcolehamilton&quot;&gt;@agcolehamilton&lt;/a&gt; to win &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/EdinburghWestern?src=hash&quot;&gt;#EdinburghWestern&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/scotlibdems&quot;&gt;@scotlibdems&lt;/a&gt; have been cut, yet again.

With so many voters seemingly content to trust the SNP with power for another term, he insists that locally <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/29/snp-business-spokeswoman-leaves-party-after-mortgage-allegations\">faith in the nationalists has been eroded by Michelle Thomson</a>, his constituency\u2019s Westminster representative, who withdrew from the SNP whip last September after being linked to possible mortgage fraud. Thomson denies any wrongdoing and a police investigation is ongoing.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the received wisdom is that the SNP are going to sweep the board, voters can feel there\u2019s no point,\u201d says Cole-Hamilton. \u201cBut we are finding enthusiasm here because there is a real belief that we can unseat the SNP, and people feel their vote can count and make a difference.\u201dHe points out that this constituency returned one of the largest no votes in the country, while Thompson won by majority of only a few thousand last May. </p> <p>Meanwhile, his SNP opponent, the former Yes Scotland staffer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ToniGiugliano\">Toni Giugliano</a>, argues that Cole-Hamilton is unfairly focusing on an individual who is not even standing, and observers have described this as one of the sharper contests of the campaign.</p> <p>But Cole-Hamilton, who works for a children\u2019s charity, is unrepentant: \u201cIt will be terrible for democracy for the SNP to win a super-majority again.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s always worth remembering that it wasn\u2019t only independence supporters who were drawn into political activism by the referendum. <a href=\"http://www.glasgowconservatives.com/person/annie-wells\">Annie Wells</a>, the Scottish Conservative candidate for Glasgow Provan, got involved with the pro-union campaign Better Together, when she says her notions of \u2018what a Tory is\u2019 were blown away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1a93ccb456398a8e0b0451d64c7025822c7ea566\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a93ccb456398a8e0b0451d64c7025822c7ea566/51_477_1930_1931/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Annie Wells at the Scottish Conservatives manifesto launch in Glasgow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Annie Wells at the Scottish Conservatives manifesto launch in Glasgow<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019d never related to being a Tory, and I came from a working class family,\u201d explains Wells, who lives in the north east of Glasgow with her son and works as a manager at Marks and Spencer.

I\u2019m not from a family that was political at all. When I\u2019ve not had any lunch, or have no time to spend with my girlfriend, I do ask myself why am I choosing this? But the reason is that there aren\u2019t many voices like mine in politics.\u201d</p> <p>She adds: \u201cWe need those fresh voices to make people reflect that they are in an institution like any other.

Nonetheless, she adds: \u201cI know everyone says this but when we\u2019re able to speak face to face to people they really like our ideas.\u201d Voters have been particularly interested in Rise\u2019s alternative to the council tax, as well as plans for a living income for carers, she reports. </p> <p>Although Boyd was familiar a degree of public recognition from her referendum campaigning, she admits that standing as an election candidate has been a difficult transition. \u201cFor a person from a very small party, a lot of my life has had a large amount of attention. But there has to come a moment when you put your ego to the side and commit yourself.\u201d<br /></p> <p>\u201cI think because I am a woman in the public eye and not frightened to say things that are unpopular, a lot of it comes from the idea that \u2018you should know your place\u2019.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jamie Lloyd\u2019s production of Doctor Faustus at the Duke of York\u2019s is packed with Game of Thrones fans eager to see Kit Harington on stage. They get to see plenty of him, in a production that, before you even get in the theatre, is screaming its youthful credentials with the music blaring in the foyer. That\u2019s no bad thing, getting you pumped up for the full-frontal excesses ahead, and makes a pleasant change from most West End foyers, which resound with the tinkle of ice in G&amp;Ts and people talking loudly about their holidays in Tuscany. There is nothing in the remotest bit polite about this night at theatre, with its spraying bodily fluids and writhing bodies. Mostly it made me want to lie down quietly in a darkened room. But it\u2019s not primarily meant for me or people with a textual intimacy with Marlowe\u2019s play. Faustus, and Lloyd\u2019s similarly swaggering, campy production of The Maids \u2013 with stars from Orange Is the New Black, Fresh Meat and Downton Abbey \u2013 are part of a bold attempt to get new and younger audiences into the West End, audiences who have so far got through life very well, thank you, without knowing their Genet from their Marlowe. An audience who might go to see Book of Mormon or Mamma Mia! for a birthday treat, but who would certainly not look to 17th century drama for a big night out. An audience who know their Netflix but not their Pinter. You may not like the way he\u2019s going about it, but Lloyd is addressing a question that every theatre in the country, whether in the West End or the subsidised sector, needs to consider: how do we serve those who have never stepped inside our cultural cathedrals? One of the concerns over his latest production, raised by some of the reviews and online commenters, has been whether audiences are not really getting to see Marlowe\u2019s Doctor Faustus. But that\u2019s unlikely to concern an audience whose familiarity with the play is minimal \u2013 so will have no idea that what they are seeing is a \u201cMarvolian mish-mash\u201d but will certainly pick up on all the pop references in Lloyd\u2019s production and respond to the idea of Faustus as a dead-behind-the-eyes celebrity conjuror. One of my most cherished encounters in the theatre was at Headlong\u2019s The Seagull when it became apparent during the interval that the young man in the seat next to me had no idea that the play was a century old. It seemed so new-minted to him. All classics should feel like that. Likewise, many in the Faustus audience come unencumbered with any knowledge with the play\u2019s performance history. They simply take the production on its own terms. It\u2019s not a great production, not least because all the sound and fury is downright confusing and obscures the storytelling, but it does have some fine things in it: Lloyd often arranges his cast like a latter-day Bosch, Harington acquits himself pretty well and Jenna Russell\u2019s Mephistopheles is marvellously complex, a mixture of melancholy and jealousy whose post-interval rendition of Meatloaf\u2019s Bat Out of Hell is brilliant, not least in that it gives a sense that it\u2019s hellish to be constantly reminded of the Eden you\u2019ve lost. The anxiety that has surfaced in reviews \u2013 that this is more Jamie Lloyd\u2019s Faustus than Marlowe\u2019s \u2013 feeds into wider concerns about perceived dumbing down, how contemporary theatre can represent the classics for modern audiences, and how these modern audiences behave. Most of all, it feeds into the feeling that theatres would like a younger and more diverse audience \u2013 but only on theatres\u2019 own outdated terms, and only if they can continue to churn out the same old, respectful but dusty revivals of plays with classic status. I may not personally like what Lloyd\u2019s done with Faustus but I\u2019m delighted that he\u2019s doing it, and that it\u2019s in the West End.",

      "bodyText": "1) Ranieri and Leicester ready to celebrate their way The romantic at heart might hope that Leicester complete their crowning achievement on their own turf by defeating Everton at an incredulous King Power Stadium but the fact we can seemingly afford to be that picky is astonishing in itself and perhaps an alternative ending will be appropriate in its way. Claudio Ranieri is likely to be somewhere in the airspace between Italy and England during Monday evening\u2019s potentially decisive meeting between Chelsea and Tottenham, a lunch arrangement with his 96-year-old mother taking priority over any handwringing in front of the television. There is the risk of verging on tweeness when talking about Ranieri these days \u2013 his team\u2019s probable triumph has been overseen by a formidable football mind \u2013 but the lovely seam of eccentricity that has run through Leicester\u2019s season is genuine and this might be a finale entirely in tune. They have done things their way and, even if Ranieri\u2019s trip does not quite match Derby County\u2019s tale from 1972 \u2013 the squad were holidaying in Mallorca and Brian Clough in the Scilly Isles with his family when news of their title win came through \u2013 it is at least another reminder of the very human element of this story. If Chelsea have produced the goods by the time Ranieri touches back down on English soil on Monday night then it is fair to assume he will not pass through the airport terminal unnoticed. Then, the celebration of a thrilling triumph can begin in earnest. Nick Ames \u2022 Match report: Manchester United 1-1 Leicester City \u2022 How Leicester\u2019s five-year fairytale unfolded 2) The strange case of Stoke\u2019s missing front three There was plenty of hype about Stoke City\u2019s front three when they edged a seven-goal thriller against Everton on 28 December. Yet although Marko Arnautovic scored in Saturday\u2019s draw with Sunderland, the other members of that attacking trident have tailed off badly. Bojan Krkic was an unused substitute against Sunderland and Xherdan Shaqiri was kept quiet by Patrick van Aanholt, at one point tripping over his own feet when he tried to dribble through a crowd of defenders on the edge of the area. Stoke\u2019s most effective method of attack against Sunderland was hanging high, diagonal crosses towards Peter Crouch and, thinking back to the excitement of that win at Goodison Park, when Shaqiri scored one of the goals of the season, it is hard not to see that shift in emphasis as a step backwards. Jacob Steinberg \u2022 Match report: Stoke City 1-1 Sunderland \u2022 Sam Allardyce admits pressure from Newcastle may be affecting Sunderland 3) Don\u2019t over-estimate the Twitterati Unbowed by the right old, entirely predictable, mess prompted by believers in the Arab Spring buying into comments posted on social media, we still make the mistake of taking undue notice of whatever the Twitterati has to say. If you were in north-east England last week the Twitter-related message was that Alan Pardew needed to brace himself for serious abuse on his first return to his former club, Newcastle United, as the manager of Crystal Palace. In the event Pardew proved virtually irrelevant, a mere academic footnote, to the main action, namely Rafa Ben\u00edtez\u2019s efforts to keep Newcastle in the Premier League. Contrary to pre-match suggestion, the crowd barely acknowledged their ex-manager\u2019s technical area presence throughout their side\u2019s 1-0 win at St James\u2019 Park. Hats off to Pardew for the nice, 17th-minute touch when, as is their routine, the ground broke into spontaneous applause in memory of home fans John Alder and Liam Sweeney as well as other victims of the MH17 disaster and he joined in with a minute-long demonstration of pronounced clapping. Deep down, many Newcastle fans know that, although far from a flawless manager, he is essentially a decent guy who ended up a puppet of Mike Ashley\u2019s St James\u2019 Park regime. Should Palace beat Manchester United in the impending FA Cup final there could well be resounding cheers on Tyneside but, right now, Pardew is past history in NE1. Newcastle fans showed their class and dignity by refraining from abusing him and instead indulging in sustained choruses of \u201cRafa, Rafa, Ben\u00edtez.\u201d Those chants will have hurt Palace\u2019s manager far more than any abusive taunt. Which just goes to show that, sometimes, the truth really is more complicated than social media-inspired fiction. Just ask Egyptians. Louise Taylor \u2022 Match report: Newcastle United 1-0 Crystal Palace \u2022 As it happened: read Bryan Armen Graham\u2019s minute-by-minute report 4) Time running out for Wilshere to build England sharpness There were cheers from the Emirates Stadium crowd when Jack Wilshere emerged from the substitutes\u2019 bench to warm-up midway through the first half against Norwich City \u2013 alongside Santi Cazorla. Wilshere was desperate to get on but when Ars\u00e8ne Wenger swapped Alexis S\u00e1nchez for Francis Coquelin in the 84th minute with his final change, Wilshere felt the frustration. Apart from a six-minute cameo as a substitute at Sunderland the previous weekend, Wilshere\u2019s role during this injury-wrecked season has been confined to that of onlooker. It was the same again on Saturday. Arsenal\u2019s season now has only two matches to go \u2013 the visit to Manchester City before the final-day home game against Aston Villa \u2013 which means that Wilshere has only two competitive matches to generate any kind of top-level sharpness before Euro 2016. Moreover, with the England manager, Roy Hodgson, set to name his squad on 12 May, before the final round of Premier League fixtures, Wilshere, technically, has only the City game in which to impress. The suspicion is that Hodgson will pick him regardless, based on the form he showed before he fractured his fibula on the eve of the season, and he stands to have England\u2019s warm-up matches against Turkey, Australia and Portugal in which to fine-tune. But how will Hodgson know for sure that Wilshere is ready when he picks his squad? By any reckoning, it would be a gamble. David Hytner \u2022 Match report: Arsenal 1-0 Norwich City \u2022 As it happened: read Rob Smyth\u2019s minute-by-minute report 5) Will Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s gamble pay off in Madrid? Manuel Pellegrini made eight changes to his Manchester City team for the trip to Southampton and the result was predictable. Only Kelechi Iheanacho emerged from the game with any credit for City but Pellegrini insisted afterwards that, even with hindsight, he would have selected the same team. Real Madrid and the Bernab\u00e9u await on Wednesday in the Champions League semi-finals and, given it is arguably the biggest game in City\u2019s history, Pellegrini certainly had a duty to ensure his first choice players remained fresh for midweek. However, as City\u2019s fans ironically chanted \u201cAre you watching, Real Madrid?\u201d as the team crumbled, this preparation for a huge European tie had descended into chaos. The team that lines up in Spain will clearly have no resemblance to the one on show at St Mary\u2019s, but such an emphatic defeat surely cannot have improved morale in the squad. The result has also provided Manchester United with a sliver of hope of a top-four finish, although City would still need to drop further points for their rivals to capitalise. Pellegrini, of course, will not be at City next season and has eyes only for the Champions League. If they pull off a result in Madrid this selection will be completely vindicated, but it could yet be significant in shaping City\u2019s season denouement. James Riach \u2022 Match report: Southampton 4-2 Manchester City \u2022 Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s eyes on Real Madrid 6) Are Sturridge and Liverpool a perfect match? Daniel Sturridge and Liverpool have had some beautiful moments together and should still be perfect for each other, yet too often they seem an uneasy match. Nearly all Liverpool players were substandard at Swansea but the worry regarding Sturridge is that this was not the first time recently that he has appeared to have assigned himself the role of luxury player, which is not a role for which J\u00fcrgen Klopp has regular use. Sturridge has magic in his feet and a fine scoring rate and can do things that none of the other strikers at the club can do but he doesn\u2019t do them quite often enough to justify the lack of pressing or involvement when not in possession. Perhaps he is still not fully confident about his durability following his injury problems. Whatever the reason, he is not likely to be a constant starter for Klopp\u2019s team, especially when Divock Origi and Danny Ings return, until he finds the constant dynamism demanded from forwards at all top clubs. Given how consistently good they could be together, it would be a pity if the club and the player continued to give the impression of drifting towards a separation. Paul Doyle \u2022 Match report: Swansea City 3-1 Liverpool \u2022 As it happened: read Daniel Harris\u2019s minute-by-minute report 7) Leko shines then Tony Pulis lets rip at academy system Are academies these days too soft on young players? West Brom\u2019s manager certainly thinks so. Before likening his 17-year-old starlet Jonathan Leko to Crystal Palace\u2019s Yannick Bolasie after his scintillating full Premier League debut on Saturday, Tony Pulis let rip at a system he believes is not producing the best from talented prospects. \u201cI keep saying, academy football is a system that is supposed to be there for excellence,\u201d Pulis said. \u201cIn any other sport players would be driven and pushed. Playing in important games with seasoned professionals is important and for some reason a lot of academies want to keep their players playing under-21 football. It\u2019s beyond me. I\u2019ve watched under-21 football and it\u2019s certainly not preparation for what is needed out there. \u201cI thought he [Leko] was fantastic,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit similar to Bolasie at Crystal Palace, he has raw pace and talent. He does things that are instinctive. The kid can be a good player, but he needs to learn the game with professionals.\u201d Leko, who like Bolasie has his roots in the Democratic Republic of Congo, definitely looks like a star in the making. He moved to the UK as a child to escape civil war and has already represented England at youth level. Leko is also the eighth West Brom academy player to have featured in a matchday squad this season. Not a bad return. But, as is the nature of the Premier League these days, Pulis and new technical director Nicky Hammond will be under pressure to spend big again this summer. Ed Aarons \u2022 Match report: West Brom 0-3 West Ham \u2022 Tony Pulis refuses to commit future to club 8) Berghuis the enigma raises questions of S\u00e1nchez Flores Watford have succeeded this season despite fielding on the flanks players who are enormously more comfortable when played infield. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Jurado has played the vast majority of his 1,762 Premier League minutes on the left wing, claiming a single assist. Valon Behrami, \u00c9tienne Capoue, Almen Abdi and Adl\u00e8ne Guedioura have all had a go at pretending to be wingers, offering little effective width, even less pace, few decent crosses, a collective unwillingness to take on their opponents and a combined tally of three assists and two goals. In January the Hornets attempted to address this weakness, bidding for Andros Townsend and signing, for an estimated \u00a36m, the Moroccan winger Nordin Amrabat. Meanwhile, Steven Berghuis sat on the sidelines. The Dutch winger, who arrived for \u00a34.5m from AZ Alkmaar in July, appeared off the bench in five of the club\u2019s first nine league games, for an average of 17 minutes each, and then disappeared. Between the middle of October, when he looked out of his depth when brought on with his side already 2-0 down against Arsenal, and the end of April he was on the bench six times, left out of the matchday squad 18 times \u2013 not featuring between 2 January and 2 April \u2013 and played not a single minute of league football. At West Ham 10 days ago he actually came on off the bench, playing for 34 minutes and receiving favourable reviews. On Saturday he played another 33 minutes and transformed the game. He was named man of the match, and if Watford had a cross of the season award he would have wrapped that up too, with the centre for Troy Deeney\u2019s last-minute equaliser. Clearly desperate to impress, he cut inside at pace, skipped past defenders, took shots and passed successfully over long and short distance. He looked, in short, like the player \u2013 one of the players, at least \u2013 that his side has so badly needed, at least over the last four months. Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores said after the game that Berghuis \u201cwasn\u2019t ready to play\u201d earlier in the season, but has since \u201cworked very hard\u201d. From the sidelines it was hard to know if the winger\u2019s excellence on Saturday represented evidence of the Spaniard\u2019s questionable decision-making, or of his superlative coaching. Simon Burnton \u2022 Match report: Watford 3-2 Aston Villa \u2022 Eric Black claims Aston Villa squad feel hurt by human cost of relegation 9) Mart\u00ednez may leave Everton in better position than he found them Look at the league table and Everton have regressed on Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s watch. David Moyes\u2019s long reign ended in sixth place and, while his successor initially took them up to fifth, back-to-back lower-half finishes now beckon for the first time since 2002. And yet, in some respects, the Spaniard\u2019s legacy will be better than his inheritance. Admittedly, his successor will have to tighten up the defence and a reliance on thirty-somethings such as Leighton Baines, Phil Jagielka and Gareth Barry is an issue that requires addressing. Yet many of Moyes\u2019s other ageing stalwarts have either left \u2013 in the cases of Sylvain Distin, Nikica Jelavic and Marouane Fellaini \u2013 or have been phased out, with Steven Pienaar, Leon Osman and Tim Howard fringe figures now. Mart\u00ednez has switched the focus to a younger generation. Ross Barkley had started only four top-flight games before his appointment and John Stones none. Now the latter, along with Romelu Lukaku, could bring in more than \u00a3100m. Everton\u2019s results have been underwhelming for the last two seasons but Mart\u00ednez has recruited players whose careers are on the up, in James McCarthy, Muhamed Besic, Gerard Deulofeu and, perhaps, Ramiro Funes Mori. He also has a generation of young defenders, in Matthew Pennington, Brendan Galloway, Tyias Browning, Luke Garbutt and Mason Holgate, some of whom could break through. What he has not done, over the last two years, is to harness the considerable potential of his side. But, assuming he departs this summer, his replacement may find much to his liking at Goodison Park. Richard Jolly \u2022 Match report: Everton 2-1 Bournemouth \u2022 Eddie Howe insists he is committed to Bournemouth amid Everton links 10) Van Gaal unwilling to risk defeat for chance of victory A feature of Louis van Gaal\u2019s time at Manchester United has been substitutions as ineffectual as they are unfathomable, and Sunday\u2019s game was no different. With Manchester City facing a difficult game at Southampton, followed by a trip to Madrid, followed by a visit from Arsenal, United had the chance to apply some pressure by beating Leicester. No small task, but after the hour with the scores level, Van Gaal again took predictable, conservative options, unwilling to risk defeat for an essential victory. As such, his team finished the game with one man up front, the message of three like-for-like changes typical and clear: the players underperformed, but the system was unimprovable.

Whatever the reason, he is not likely to be a constant starter for Klopp\u2019s team, especially when Divock Origi and Danny Ings return, until he finds the constant dynamism demanded from forwards at all top clubs. Given how consistently good they could be together, it would be a pity if the club and the player continued to give the impression of drifting towards a separation.</p> <p><strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/01/swansea-city-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Swansea City 3-1 Liverpool</a><br />\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/01/swansea-v-liverpool-premier-league-live\">As it happened: read Daniel Harris\u2019s minute-by-minute report</a></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be86f697d3acc684fed0eb6542883b38a2ace8cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be86f697d3acc684fed0eb6542883b38a2ace8cf/0_69_1893_1136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swansea celebrate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swansea celebrate their demolition of Liverpool.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoff Caddick/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>7) Leko shines then Tony Pulis lets rip at academy system</h2> <p>Are academies these days too soft on young players? West Brom\u2019s manager certainly thinks so. Before likening his 17-year-old starlet Jonathan Leko to Crystal Palace\u2019s Yannick Bolasie after his scintillating full Premier League debut on Saturday, Tony Pulis let rip at a system he believes is not producing the best from talented prospects. \u201cI keep saying, academy football is a system that is supposed to be there for excellence,\u201d Pulis said. \u201cIn any other sport players would be driven and pushed. Playing in important games with seasoned professionals is important and for some reason a lot of academies want to keep their players playing under-21 football. It\u2019s beyond me. I\u2019ve watched under-21 football and it\u2019s certainly not preparation for what is needed out there. \u201cI thought he [Leko] was fantastic,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit similar to Bolasie at Crystal Palace, he has raw pace and talent. He does things that are instinctive. The kid can be a good player, but he needs to learn the game with professionals.\u201d Leko, who like Bolasie has his roots in the Democratic Republic of Congo, definitely looks like a star in the making. He moved to the UK as a child to escape civil war and has already represented England at youth level. Leko is also the eighth West Brom academy player to have featured in a matchday squad this season. Not a bad return. But, as is the nature of the Premier League these days, Pulis and new technical director Nicky Hammond will be under pressure to spend big again this summer.<strong> Ed Aarons</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://\">Match report: West Brom 0-3 West Ham</a><br />\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/22/chris-brunt-west-brom-future-coin-throwing\">Tony Pulis refuses to commit future to club</a></p> </blockquote> <h2>8) Berghuis the enigma raises questions of S\u00e1nchez Flores</h2> <p>Watford have succeeded this season despite fielding on the flanks players who are enormously more comfortable when played infield. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Jurado has played the vast majority of his 1,762 Premier League minutes on the left wing, claiming a single assist. Valon Behrami, \u00c9tienne Capoue, Almen Abdi and Adl\u00e8ne Guedioura have all had a go at pretending to be wingers, offering little effective width, even less pace, few decent crosses, a collective unwillingness to take on their opponents and a combined tally of three assists and two goals. In January the Hornets attempted to address this weakness, bidding for Andros Townsend and signing, for an estimated \u00a36m, the Moroccan winger Nordin Amrabat.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Steven Berghuis sat on the sidelines. The Dutch winger, who arrived for \u00a34.5m from AZ Alkmaar in July, appeared off the bench in five of the club\u2019s first nine league games, for an average of 17 minutes each, and then disappeared. Between the middle of October, when he looked out of his depth when brought on with his side already 2-0 down against Arsenal, and the end of April he was on the bench six times, left out of the matchday squad 18 times \u2013 not featuring between 2 January and 2 April \u2013 and played not a single minute of league football.</p> <p>At West Ham 10 days ago he actually came on off the bench, playing for 34 minutes and receiving favourable reviews. On Saturday he played another 33 minutes and transformed the game. He was named man of the match, and if Watford had a cross of the season award he would have wrapped that up too, with the centre for Troy Deeney\u2019s last-minute equaliser. Clearly desperate to impress, he cut inside at pace, skipped past defenders, took shots and passed successfully over long and short distance. He looked, in short, like the player \u2013 one of the players, at least \u2013 that his side has so badly needed, at least over the last four months.</p> <p>Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores said after the game that Berghuis \u201cwasn\u2019t ready to play\u201d earlier in the season, but has since \u201cworked very hard\u201d. From the sidelines it was hard to know if the winger\u2019s excellence on Saturday represented evidence of the Spaniard\u2019s questionable decision-making, or of his superlative coaching. <strong>Simon Burnton</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/30/watford-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Watford 3-2 Aston Villa</a><br />\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/30/aston-villa-eric-black-premier-league-watford\">Eric Black claims Aston Villa squad feel hurt by human cost of relegation</a></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44d251461cdf6a4855239afeb87f2ccc33a7979e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44d251461cdf6a4855239afeb87f2ccc33a7979e/91_117_2033_1220/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores stay at Watford?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9) Mart\u00ednez may leave Everton in better position than he found them</h2> <p>Look at the league table and Everton have regressed on Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s watch. David Moyes\u2019s long reign ended in sixth place and, while his successor initially took them up to fifth, back-to-back lower-half finishes now beckon for the first time since 2002. And yet, in some respects, the Spaniard\u2019s legacy will be better than his inheritance. Admittedly, his successor will have to tighten up the defence and a reliance on thirty-somethings such as Leighton Baines, Phil Jagielka and Gareth Barry is an issue that requires addressing. Yet many of Moyes\u2019s other ageing stalwarts have either left \u2013 in the cases of Sylvain Distin, Nikica Jelavic and Marouane Fellaini \u2013 or have been phased out, with Steven Pienaar, Leon Osman and Tim Howard fringe figures now. Mart\u00ednez has switched the focus to a younger generation. Ross Barkley had started only four top-flight games before his appointment and John Stones none. Now the latter, along with Romelu Lukaku, could bring in more than \u00a3100m. Everton\u2019s results have been underwhelming for the last two seasons but Mart\u00ednez has recruited players whose careers are on the up, in James McCarthy, Muhamed Besic, Gerard Deulofeu and, perhaps, Ramiro Funes Mori. He also has a generation of young defenders, in Matthew Pennington, Brendan Galloway, Tyias Browning, Luke Garbutt and Mason Holgate, some of whom could break through. What he has not done, over the last two years, is to harness the considerable potential of his side. But, assuming he departs this summer, his replacement may find much to his liking at Goodison Park. <strong>Richard Jolly</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/30/everton-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">Match report: Everton 2-1 Bournemouth</a><br />\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/29/eddie-howe-committed-bournemouth-everton-links-manager-robert-martinez\">Eddie Howe insists he is committed to Bournemouth amid Everton links</a></p> </blockquote> <h2>10) Van Gaal unwilling to risk defeat for chance of victory</h2> <p>A feature of Louis van Gaal\u2019s time at Manchester United has been substitutions as ineffectual as they are unfathomable, and Sunday\u2019s game was no different. With Manchester City facing a difficult game at Southampton, followed by a trip to Madrid, followed by a visit from Arsenal, United had the chance to apply some pressure by beating Leicester. No small task, but after the hour with the scores level, Van Gaal again took predictable, conservative options, unwilling to risk defeat for an essential victory. As such, his team finished the game with one man up front, the message of three like-for-like changes typical and clear: the players underperformed, but the system was unimprovable. <strong>Daniel

      "bodyText": "From a US and British perspective, the most pressing issue in Iraq is defeating Islamic State. For Iraqi citizens, however, it is the ongoing abject failure of the prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, and his government to provide basic public services, create jobs, and root out corruption among the country\u2019s kleptocratic political class. Into this gap between external strategic perception and domestic political reality has stepped Moqtada al-Sadr, the charismatic Shia cleric and former Mahdi army leader whose virulent sectarianism and violent resistance to the US occupation earned him notoriety in the west and hero status among many Iraqi Shias between 2004 and 2008. The street protest movement that has rocked Baghdad in recent weeks, culminating in the weekend invasion of the walled government, parliament and embassy enclave known as the green zone, is largely directed by Sadr, who has moved his centre of operations from the holy city of Najaf to the capital. Some demonstrations have drawn up to 200,000 people. No longer the sectarian firebrand and anti-US insurgent, Sadr has recast himself as a man of all the people, a fervent Iraqi nationalist and federalist who upholds the democratic process by non-violent means. The Mahdi army militia was disbanded in 2008. In the 2014 elections, the Sadrist al-Ahrar bloc won 34 seats in parliament. In short, Sadr has gone legit. Far from seeking Abadi\u2019s overthrow, Sadr says he wants to help him implement reforms, in particular to end the discredited quota system introduced by Washington after the 2003 invasion. Quotas were intended to ensure Iraq\u2019s main ethno-religious constituencies \u2013 Shias, Sunnis and Kurds \u2013 shared power, but they have been widely abused to enrich office-holders and extend party political patronage. Abadi, though personally popular, is widely seen as weak \u2013 and his divided, faction-riven administration even weaker. The territorial sweep Isis made in 2014 and the contempt for Baghdad\u2019s writ shown by southern Shia tribal chiefs and northern Kurdish separatists have led some analysts to suggest the centre cannot hold. Sadr\u2019s claim to be on Abadi\u2019s side while his tactics further undermine the prime minister\u2019s authority could prove fatal. Abadi\u2019s departure would be a big problem for Washington, which spent months trying to unseat his predecessor, Nouri al-Maliki, largely because he was seen as pursuing a sectarian Shia agenda. Abadi is their man and last week Joe Biden, the US vice-president, was briefly in Baghdad, supposedly stiffening backbones and refocusing attention on Isis. His efforts do not appear to have succeeded. Washington and its western allies worry, with good reason, that the unrest, coupled with political inertia and cash-flow problems exacerbated by global oil price falls, is undermining their key aim of defeating Isis. Army units reportedly recalled to help with security in Baghdad had been intended for use in the expected campaign to expel Isis from Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second city. Last week Barack Obama expressed surprising optimism that Mosul would fall by the end of the year, a claim that suggested how out of touch Washington may have become. The contrary story on the ground is that the Iraqi army, far from being on the point of storming Mosul, is under-resourced and once again suffering desertions and low morale. Sadr has a dog in the Isis fight, too. His so-called Peace Companies, armed militia that are the successors to the Mahdi army, have fought against Isis alongside the government-sanctioned, Shia-centric Popular Mobilisation Forces, known locally as as al-Hashd al-Shaabi . These forces, more than the Iraqi army, are praised for recent successes against the jihadis. Sadr also uses his militia to protect Shia holy sites, further raising his public profile. Sadr\u2019s re-emergence as a powerful national leader may have some advantages for Washington. Despite three years spent in voluntary exile in Iran, his newly minted nationalist stance makes him a potential bulwark against Tehran\u2019s influence, which has become all-pervasive since the US left. There are sharp tensions between Sadr and rival Shia factions, and Sadrist militia have clashed with the Iranian-backed Hashd. Sadr enjoys the sort of grassroots support that few if any other Iraqi politicians currently command. This does not include the Sunni minority, whose rejection of any Shia-dominated central authority looks likely to continue. If Abadi is deposed, however, they and Washington may have little choice but to deal with a former hate figure once dubbed the \u201cmost dangerous man in Iraq\u201d.",

Abadi is their man and last week Joe Biden, the US vice-president, was briefly in Baghdad, supposedly stiffening backbones and refocusing attention on Isis. <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/world/if-iraq-pm-fails-to-survive-chaos-washington-must-decide-whats-next-20160501-goj6ac.html\">His efforts do not appear to have succeeded</a>. </p> <p>Washington and its western allies worry, with good reason, that the unrest, coupled with political inertia and cash-flow problems exacerbated by global oil price falls, is undermining their key aim of defeating Isis. Army units reportedly recalled to help with security in Baghdad had been intended for use in the expected campaign to expel Isis from Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second city. </p> <p>Last week Barack Obama expressed surprising optimism that Mosul would fall by the end of the year, a claim that suggested how out of touch Washington may have become. The contrary story on the ground is that the Iraqi army, far from being on the point of storming Mosul, is under-resourced and <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/19/obama-iraq-retake-mosul-isis-end-year/\">once again suffering desertions and low morale</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/25/tony-blair-is-right-without-the-iraq-war-there-would-be-no-isis\">Tony Blair is right: without the Iraq war there would be no Islamic State</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sadr has a dog in the Isis fight, too. His so-called Peace Companies, armed militia that are the successors to the Mahdi army, have fought against Isis alongside the government-sanctioned, Shia-centric Popular Mobilisation Forces, known locally as as al-Hashd al-Shaabi . These forces, more than the Iraqi army, are praised for recent successes against the jihadis. Sadr also uses his militia to protect Shia holy sites, further <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21695039-new-challenge-embattled-prime-minister-unquiet-cleric\">raising his public profile</a>.  </p> <p>Sadr\u2019s re-emergence as a powerful national leader may have some advantages for Washington. Despite three years spent in voluntary exile in Iran, his newly minted nationalist stance makes him a potential bulwark against Tehran\u2019s influence, which has become all-pervasive since the US left. There are sharp tensions between Sadr and rival Shia factions, and Sadrist militia have clashed with the Iranian-backed Hashd. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/05/al-sadre-enthusiastically-welcomed\">Sadr enjoys the sort of </a>grassroots support that few if any other Iraqi politicians currently command. This does not include the Sunni minority, whose rejection of any Shia-dominated central authority looks likely to continue. If Abadi is deposed, however, they and Washington may have little choice but to deal with a former hate figure once dubbed the \u201cmost dangerous man in Iraq\u201d.</p>",

Millions of adoring fans\u2026\u201d I\u2019m talking about Ash Wild, of course - the fictional rock star of Target, the latest book in my Bodyguard series. Ash is the rock star I wanted to be - aside from the maniac killer who wants him dead, of course. You see, before I became a full-time children\u2019s author, I was a professional musician and songwriter. I gigged the length and breadth of the UK, recorded four albums (one for a small indie label and the others self-funded) and, amid the countless knockbacks, I experienced some incredible moments including: selling out at The Borderline Club in London having my album sold in HMV Oxford Street hanging out with Robbie Williams, Blur and Kylie Minogue appearing as the songwriting coach for E4\u2019s School of Performing Arts and even performing for the Queen at the 21st Celebration of the Commonwealth! But becoming the ultimate rock star proved elusive (I was definitely surviving, not thriving as a musician). Almost every major and independent record company, publisher and manager said \u201cNo!\u201d and closed the door in my face. It was enough to break the will of even the most dedicated musician. But I don\u2019t begrudge any of it. In fact all those experiences and rejections made me into the author I am today. After more than a decade of slogging my guts out as a musician, I was given the opportunity to write a book about songwriting, Heart &amp; Soul: The Craft of Songwriting \u2013 suddenly the wheels of fortune turned for me. Rejection karma. That\u2019s what I called it. Following years of \u201cno\u201d from the music industry, everyone in the book publishing world said yes! The success of Heart &amp; Soul quickly led on to four more books about songwriting and the music business, before I was struck by the idea for Young Samurai and my writing career really took off. Now four books into my Bodyguard series, I\u2019ve come full circle and returned to my musical roots. Those experiences (good and bad) in the music business have become crucial to writing Target. Ash Wild, the world\u2019s biggest teen rock star in history, is the target of a crazed stalker. Top bodyguard recruit Charley Hunter is assigned to protect the superstar on his sell-out US tour. Faced with death threats, suspicious \u201caccidents\u201d and a rebellious rock star, Charley is in a race to unmask the killer in their midst - but how will she spot a killer in a crowd of 50,000 screaming fans? Now while I was never the focus of such adulation that Ash experiences in the book, I saw first-hand the intoxicating world of celebrity\u2026 and its dangers: the over-obsessed fan, the jealous musician, the maniac stalker. And as a former musician I could really get inside the head of my character Ash Wild. Understand the deep satisfaction of writing a song, the thrill of a live show and the sheer craziness of being in the midst of a mass of screaming fans. In fact the songs I wrote and performed as a musician form part of the storyline. These are the songs that Ash performs in his concerts and readers can even hear sample Ash Wild tracks online\u2026 So I have lived my dream of being a rock star at last\u2026 albeit through my character Ash Wild. Yet, if the truth be said, being a children\u2019s author isn\u2019t that far off being a rock star\u2026 I get to tour the world, appear at festivals, sign autographs, meet obsessed fans, I even experience the occasional scream or two after a performance (authors are the rock stars of the literary world to librarians!). But most important of all, I get to influence and inspire young people - with words rather than music.

The chair of the Senate committee charged with investigating a national corruption watchdog, Senator Dio Wang, also called on the government to commit the research funding before it enters caretaker mode before the double-dissolution election expected on 2 July. \u201cWe were forced into delivering this limited interim report, because a full and proper inquiry is being shut down by the government\u2019s early election to wipe independent voices from the parliament,\u201d said Wang, who chaired the Senate select committee into the establishment of a national integrity commission. \u201cI call on the government \u2013 before it enters caretaker mode \u2013 to ensure funding is granted for the research being led by Griffith University with Transparency International Australia, the Queensland Integrity Commissioner, the NSW Ombudsman and other public sector and academic stakeholders, to identify an appropriate federal anti-corruption system, which the inquiry heard has overwhelming public support.\u201d The report will be released tomorrow during the budget lock up. Neither of the major parties support a national anti-corruption body. The committee received a number of \u201cprotected\u201d submissions containing allegations which could not be publicly released and, due to the early election, the committee could not address them. \u201cIn the crucial area of protected submissions, there is not even enough time to properly communicate with submitters about the appropriate course of action for their concerns,\u201d Wang said. The committee heard evidence that most federal agencies\u2019 anti-corruption work was unsupervised and half the total federal public sector were not in the jurisdiction of the Australian Public Service Commission internal compliance systems. The committee also heard research evidence that found almost one in three Australians see the federal government as corrupt (more so than state or local governments), with 43% of people believing corruption is on the rise. \u201cCorruption risks have increased in recent years due to increased government control of information, increased funding needs of political campaigns, privatisation of government services and projects, retired ministers and their staff becoming lobbyists and large infrastructure funding decisions, and yet this government does not support the establishment of an overarching federal corruption watchdog because it claims existing measures are sufficient,\u201d Wang said.",

      "bodyText": "The widow of Omid, a 23-year-old refugee who set himself alight on Nauru, says she is being kept in a small Brisbane hotel, told to stay away from the windows, and sedated if she starts to cry too much. The woman, whose husband died on Friday from injuries sustained when he set himself alight in front of UN representatives at a refugee settlement, also said she has been denied a lawyer and is unable to call her family, and that immigration officials are trying to convince her to return home to Iran. \u201cYou know I\u2019m grieving and I need to cry but as soon as I want to cry they give me pills or injections to keep me calm,\u201d she said in a recorded message sent to Guardian Australia and interpreted. \u201cThey don\u2019t want my voice to be raised or heard by others. They want me to be emotionless and inactive.\u201d Omid was medivacced from Nauru almost 24 hours after he set his clothes on fire. His wife has blamed the delay \u2013 in both medical care on the island and in transferring him out \u2013 for his death. On Friday she said her husband had gone hours without seeing a doctor when he was first brought to the Nauru hospital, and that he couldn\u2019t be given intravenous pain relief. Omid\u2019s wife, who did not want her name printed, was brought to Brisbane to be alongside her husband in hospital, before he died. She is now believed to be in the company of a friend and immigration guards at a Brisbane hotel. She is understood to be receiving medical care at the Brisbane Immigration Transit Accommodation. \u201cThey are keeping me in a small hotel and no one is supposed to know about my location. I have to be careful even when I walk by the windows, so not to be observed from outside. They have told me, if anyone finds out your whereabouts we will put more restrictions on you. I\u2019m not even allowed to yell or cry.\u201d She said she had sought access to a lawyer, but it was denied to her. \u201cThey told me because I don\u2019t have a right visa I\u2019m not eligible for a lawyer,\u201d she said. The ABC reported on Monday morning the Australian government has asked Omid\u2019s family to foot the $17,000 bill to send his body back to Iran, but it is understood the repatriation is still being discussed. A friend of Omid\u2019s wife said immigration officials had also tried to convince her to return to Iran with her husband\u2019s body. She is, just as Omid was, a recognised refugee whose claims of persecution in her home country were found to be valid. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection denied all allegations put to it by Guardian Australia. A spokeswoman said the department was providing Omid\u2019s wife with \u201caccess to a range of support services to help her through this difficult time\u201d. She said the department did not comment on the medical care of individuals, and \u2013 in response to questions on the conditions in which Omid\u2019s wife is being held \u2013 the \u201cremaining claims are untrue\u201d. Doctors for Refugees has sought access to Omid\u2019s wife, but has not yet gained approval from the immigration department. Dr Barri Phatarfod, co-founder of the group, said sedation of distressed people in immigration detention was common. \u201cIf someone is distraught, in distress, or threatening self-harm, they\u2019re under this quite ominous category called non-compliance,\u201d Phatarfod said. \u201cSo many people we\u2019ve seen who are deemed non-compliant \u2026 it results in their sedation. \u201cWe\u2019re in touch with a lot of people on Manus Island, and they say when someone has completely had enough \u2026 they get sedated.\u201d Omid and his wife were living in Nibok settlement on Nauru when Omid self-immolated infront of UN officials from Canberra. UNHCR were on Nauru conducting a monitoring visit, focussing on the \u201cseriously deteriorated mental health of the transferred asylum-seekers and refugees\u201d at both sites, a spokeswoman said. A video, seen by Guardian Australia but which we have chosen not to publish, shows Omid standing in a clearing, soaked in a liquid believed to be accelerant. He shouts \u201cthis is how tired we are, this action will prove how exhausted we are. I cannot take it anymore,\u201d according to a witness. Bystanders raced to tackle Omid and smother the flames, and another video shows him in the Nauru hospital. His wife said it took two hours for a doctor to come to see him, and that he wasn\u2019t give a sheet to lay on. \u201cStaff in Nauru hospital couldn\u2019t help Omid in any way because they were unequipped,\u201d she said. \u201cA lack of proper equipment and facilities was the reason that staff couldn\u2019t help and treat Omid in the Nauru hospital.\u201d Omid suffered cardiac arrest during the night, but wasn\u2019t flown to Brisbane until the next day. His wife said doctors told her he was brain dead before he arrived. He died on Friday afternoon, and his death will be referred to the Queensland coroner.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Here was the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, winding up to carp eradication. I\u2019m going to cut our collective losses now and get a few things done for tomorrow. You\u2019ve been wonderful, and we\u2019ll be seeing you again for all the glories of budget day. Let\u2019s recap Monday, budget eve. The major parties tried out their budget arguments ahead of tomorrow in the way you do when nobody quite knows what the sum of the parts will actually say \u2013 either the budget itself or the Labor response to it. The treasurer wasn\u2019t quite sure when the budget actually was. Presumably he\u2019ll know tomorrow. Malcolm Turnbull wanted to make a moment of his government\u2019s recent decision to purchase submarines from France, hosting the French prime minister in the courtyard for \u2018a great day for our two countries\u2019 session \u2013 which was rather undercut by a direct question from a French journalist during the press conference: why are we here? The government decided to have some fun with a new memoir from Bill Shorten in which the Labor leader says he wants to lead collaboratively, like a union official. The horror. The horror. Barnaby Joyce thought he\u2019d talk about carp eradication in question time, proving once again his enduring talent for making a scene. The high court began hearing a challenge to the new senate voting reform laws. Apart from that, everyone conserved energy, more or less. You should too. Have a great night, we\u2019ll see you in the morning. A quick update on matters constitutional. Today\u2019s high court hearing of Bob Day\u2019s challenge of Senate voting reform got off to a testy start, with Chief Justice Robert French warning Day\u2019s counsel Peter King not to deliver \u201cnormative speeches\u201d when he claimed major parties would urge voters to just vote one above the line. Stick to the legal nitty gritty, was CJ\u2019s advice. The essence of Day\u2019s argument was that the choice of voting above-the-line or below-the-line created different methods of voting, in breach of the constitution which requires only one method of voting. Whereas an above-the-line vote under the old system equated to a comprehensive vote for all the candidates under the line, under the new system a vote above the line might exhaust if the parties\u2019 candidates are knocked out. King said this meant voters had to choose whether to vote by what he called a first-past-the-post or optional preferential voting method. King said parties had a \u201cjust vote 1 above the line campaign in their back pockets\u201d which when rolled out would amount to \u201cplumping the vote, and denying independents and minor parties the support they\u2019d have under a full preferential voting system\u201d. Questions from the bench were highly sceptical, noting voters still retained the choice of whether to vote above or below the line regardless of what parties told them to do. Day\u2019s counsel is halfway through his arguments, the hearing resumes at 10:15 tomorrow morning. For folks keen to swot mightily for budget day tomorrow, my colleague Gareth Hutchens has complied an incredibly handy ready reckoner about known knowns and unknown unknowns in the economic statement/the alibi for the past three years/budget for billionaires. Swotters, one and all, look here. I keep getting distracted by visitors in the office, sorry I am punting on. Earlier in the day I mentioned Lenore Taylor and I will be doing a weekly Politics Live podcast throughout the election campaign. If you are looking for the iTines link in order to subscribe you can find it here. This did actually happen today. Lest you doubt my word. Treasurer on budget eve. Scott Morrison, at a couple of points in question time, seemed not to know it was budget eve. Totally understandable. Tony Abbott on the verge of a spill. We feel you. Two questions to wrap that session, one on whether the former director of the Victorian Liberal party (who has pleaded guilty to stealing $1.2m of party funds) has paid the money back. Morrison, representing the special minister of state, says he\u2019ll get back to Labor on that one. Then there is a Dorothy Dixer on stopping the boats and strong border protection policies into the future. Malcolm Turnbull has now called time on question time. Give me a few minutes and I\u2019ll be back with pictures and the rest of the afternoon. The deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce has just launched an incomprehensible rhetorical assault on carp. I think. I think the government intends to stop the carp. The foreign minister Julie Bishop\u2019s face, sitting behind Joyce, a captive consuming the carp story, was priceless. Labor would like to know whether the government will join Labor in supporting an Australian candidate to be the next secretary general of the United Nations. Malcolm Turnbull has a bit of a chuckle at this. Is this a Voldermort candidate? The prime minister: Mr Speaker, and what the honourable member has omitted to mention is the name of the person that she\u2019s actually proposing, who I suspect is somebody whose deficiencies she has set out in great deal at various times. But, Mr Speaker, these matters are - in the event of this matter becoming a live one, then certainly the Cabinet will consider it and give it due attention. Let me say this .. The environment minister Greg Hunt is about to sail forth in Pyne territory. Or perhaps not. Perhaps this will be our emissions reductions are better than your emissions reductions. Yes, that\u2019s where we are. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get to the carbon tax. It seems inevitable. Oh no, it\u2019s an electricity tax. Here it is. A wicked electricity tax. Go big, Greg. Go big. (Sorry, but honestly.) Manager of government business, Christopher Pyne. So we now know the choice that Labor has made \u2013 they\u2019ve decided to go for the cafe latte set in the inner city, rather than support the workers in the Hunter Valley, or in Whyalla, or in Port Kembla and all around Australia. Mr Speaker, instead of supporting jobs and growth, they have chosen to pander to their particular minority interest .. (Latte drinkers? I don\u2019t have an ABS stat to hand but I wouldn\u2019t think latte people were a minority subset of coffee drinkers.) Pyne is expounding on Labor reintroducing a carbon tax \u2013 something that it has never actually done (the clean energy policy was a carbon price with a fixed period, it wasn\u2019t actually a tax), and has no current plans to do. But why let facts get in the way? This is question time. Negative gearing now. Q: Does the prime minister agree with his Liberal colleague for Bennelong that because of the government\u2019s current negative gearing policy, and I quote, \u201cToo often we see the young couple getting beaten at the auction and then renting out the very place this they were trying to buy\u201d. My colleague Paul Karp referenced this development for us earlier this morning. The prime minister is glad the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, has cited the member for Bennelong as an authority. Malcolm Turnbull: Mr Speaker, in this rowdy chamber, it\u2019s touching to see a note of bipartisanship and I thank the member for McMahon because the member for Bennelong observed, and I will quote the member for Bennelong: \u201cLabor\u2019s irresponsible proposal to abolish access to negative gearing on existing homes will devastate the housing market\u201d. Well, there it is. A Dixer on submarines, and AFL, and Bill Shorten switching footy teams. A Dixer on submarines, then Labor persists with education funding. Q: The Abbott/Turnbull government cut $30bn from Australian schools. Yesterday, the prime minister promised to reverse $1bn of those cuts. Does the prime minister really expect people to be grateful that he is now only cutting $29bn from Australian schools? Cuts which will mean less individual support and less individual attention for every student and every school? That question is punted to the treasurer, who says Labor never comes up with money to fund its promises. Scott Morrison: When those opposite try to fund important expenditure through tax measures, Mr Speaker, with the leader of the opposition, with Bill Shorten, we just know it never adds up. Speaking of schools, the Labor MP Clare O\u2019Neil was ejected before question time for arguing this point, with props. A Dixer on submarines before Labor returns on schools. Q: Why is the Turnbull government giving large multinationals a tax cut, while cutting billions of dollars from Australian schools? Malcolm Turnbull: Mr Speaker, what we have is a plan that will ensure that we get the outcomes parents value - that children will have the skills that enable them to compete in the 21st century economy, that teachers will be rewarded for their high capabilities, to encourage the most capable teachers to stay teaching. We\u2019ll ensure that kids are assessed for literacy and basic numeracy when they come into school at age five and the reason for that, Mr Speaker, is that we know that what is happening at the moment is the gap between the best performing kids and the worst performing ones is growing, that we have to recognise. We have been spending more and more on education but the outcomes have not been improving. Now, the answer to that is ensuring that the taxpayers\u2019 dollars, the parents\u2019 dollars, are better deployed so that we get the better outcomes. Independent Cathy McGowan has a question about trains in north east Victoria. This is to the transport minister, Darren Chester. Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I thank the member for Indi for her question and I note her ongoing interest and determination to take credit for all of the Coalition\u2019s policies in Australia. There is a whole smorgasbord of great Coalition policies for regional Australia and the member for Indi, as an independent member, has had no impact on those \u2013 in relation to mobile phone blackspots or the bridges renewal program, no impact whatsoever. (I probably wouldn\u2019t go straight for McGowan\u2019s head given the Liberal candidate, Sophie Mirabella\u2019s recent forays. I\u2019d probably play it cool. But then I\u2019m like that. Wimpy when it comes to self defeating behaviour.) Chester goes on. Those opposite asked what about Sophie, well, she has rung me as well and she is passionate about the future of the infrastructure needs in the community of Indi. She rang me in support of her community on road and rail infrastructure! Bill Shorten is on to regional Queensland now. Possibly we will work our way comprehensively around the AEC electorates grid by 3pm. Q: Four out of five workers in regional Queensland earn less than $80,000. Why is the prime minister giving the top 1% of income earners a tax cut at the same time as leaving four out of five workers in regional Queensland with absolutely nothing? Malcolm Turnbull has a brief on Bill Shorten\u2019s ebook memoir. While we are speaking about low income workers, the prime minister says, how about those workers you failed to look after at the AWU? Shorten says hang on a minute, I have objected previously to misrepresentations about my past in this chamber. Shorten says he\u2019s given a personal explanation. He asks Smith to take action. Speaker Smith says he\u2019ll review the personal explanation this afternoon and monitor answers throughout the week. Malcolm Turnbull: Mr Speaker, I recognise the sensitivity of the leader of the opposition on Clean Event and we\u2019ll move on, Mr Speaker, because the low-paid workers that the leader of the opposition betrayed didn\u2019t just work at Clean Event, Mr Speaker. It was only a few weeks ago that 50,000 self-employed owner-drivers in the trucking industry were put out of work! Labor is continuing to object. Turnbull says he\u2019s never seen so many glass jaws in his life. The next Dixer. Q: How important is sound economic management and fiscal discipline to promoting jobs and growth in our new economy? Manager of opposition business Tony Burke is on his feet. Mr Speaker, the prime minister has just made clear we shouldn\u2019t be asking questions about the budget today. Does this only apply to members on this side of the House? House Speaker Tony Smith, playing straight man. I\u2019m not here to answer questions. The treasurer has the call. Labor leader Bill Shorten. Q: My question is to the prime minister. Data from the Australian Tax Office shows that four out of five Tasmanian workers earn less than $80,000 a year. So why is the prime minister giving large multinationals a tax cut at the same time as leaving four out of five Tasmanian workers with absolutely nothing? Malcolm Turnbull: I can well understand the excitement, the anticipation, that the leader of the opposition has as he awaits the treasurer\u2019s budget tomorrow night and I can understand him being convulsed with all of the speculation and questions, but he only has to wait until tomorrow night and rather than asking speculative questions based out of fantasy, he can learn it all tomorrow night from the treasurer, who will set it all out. First Dorothy Dixer concerns how the government\u2019s economic plan will help Australians work save and invest, which inevitably brings Malcolm Turnbull to the business of pulling levers. Labor moves on to the business of the day. Budget eve business. Q: Can the prime minister explain why his government is cutting $5,000 a year from a family earning $60,000, but giving $2,600 a year tax cut to an individual who is earning $300,000 a year? Malcolm Turnbull: Mr Speaker, the premise on which the leader of the opposition has asked the question is completely fallacious. The Whitlam era tributes continue. There\u2019s another motion for Tom Lewis, a former premier and treasurer of New South Wales, who died in April. The Labor leader Bill Shorten notes: So often, Mr Speaker, there is a melancholy symmetry to the passing of old political warriors. Having just honoured a man brought down by the dismissal, we now honour someone who helped to create that. With the conservative mayor of Albury, [Lewis] set the Senate on a path to the gridlock and obstructionism that eventually brought down the Whitlam government. We have arrived in one piece at the hour of glower, which is opening today with a condolence motion for Rex Patterson, a former Whitlam government minister, and member for Dawson. Patterson died last month. Bit unkind, yes. Just enough time to boil the kettle before question time folks. Do it. To other matters before question time. While launching a report on discrimination in employment, attorney general George Brandis has officially announced the government will appoint separate age and disability discrimination commissioners, after the roles were merged in 2014. Age and disability discrimination commissioner Susan Ryan, who retires in August, welcomed the decision. \u201cI understand it was a decision for the attorney to make when he decided to give the extra role to me and I did them to the best of my ability. But I firmly believe there are two jobs that need to be done there, and certainly the community believes that,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were so many things happening like the disability insurance scheme, that the disability community felt it was better to have someone totally focused on their issues. I\u2019m very happy that\u2019s happening.\u201d Brandis did not take questions after releasing the report, instead racing off to question time. Just to cap things off, there was a sneaky full Bonaparte moment. Check the Turnbull hand. To understand how that fizzed, let\u2019s compare and contrast. Here was Malcolm Turnbull, opening his shoulders in the press conference on a great day for our two nations. These submarines are the best. They offer us the opportunity to have, to develop, to build 12 regionally superior submarines. We are an island nation and we need to ensure that we have the best defences. Now, that is the primary objective. That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. As part of that \u2013 as we build up those defences, as we give those capabilities to our navy, we do so building the submarines in Australia. We partner with our French partners to ensure that we have the best technology and we work together to develop the supply chain here in Australia right from the shipyard to every person, every firm that is contributing to this effort. This is a great national enterprise and it will drive our economic plan, our economic plan for jobs and growth in the 21st century and the 21st-century economy. That is our commitment. French journalist. Why have you cooked this up at the last minute? What are we doing here exactly? I suspect the Australian prime minister won\u2019t be entirely delighted with that \u201cwhat is point moment\u201d. Somewhat off script. A French journalist certainly cuts to the chase. Q: Mr Prime Minister, your team has developed a lot of energy in organising this private trip, this very short trip in Australia. There is no announcement on the details of the contracts so what is the point of this visit? [Ouch]. Manuel Valls says he planned a visit in March, but wasn\u2019t able to follow through. From the moment of the announcement that Australia had chosen France to build these 12 submarines then I was already in New Zealand. It was only normal that I would come here in Australia. And the decision was taken Monday evening with the president of the republic. It\u2019s not because you had very late notice of it that it was not planned. And what\u2019s important here is to say that we will keep up our promises and our commitments. Our values, this strategic partnership and our commitment deserved that I would come here. And we talked about the ... timeline, about the strategic partnership, about the job creation and the details of this agreement. The first question to Turnbull is did we buy the French submarines in order to keep our options open on nuclear propulsion in the future? (There is some commentary around to this effect.) No, says the Australian prime minister. That issue of nuclear propulsion did not form any part of our considerations. The French prime minister is asked to clarify confusion in Australia about where the submarines will be built. Manuel Valls: There\u2019s no confusion. The choice of the Australian government was to have the 12 submarines built in Australia and this was the basis of our agreement. The French prime minister notes the submarine decision is a decision that comes with responsibility. Manuel Valls: We want to be up to the task and for the trust that Australia put in us. Should the context not be obvious, the French prime minister is in town because we intend to buy French submarines. Turnbull welcomes his French counterpart by referencing our shared history. Malcolm Turnbull: One hundred years ago the diggers of Australia and France were battling together to defend the liberty of France .. Then a chunk on the spaceships of the ocean, as the independent Senator John Madigan once called submarines. Then back to the strategic links. Malcolm Turnbull: Beyond the matter of submarines we work closely together in freedom\u2019s cause. We are working closely together as part of the global coalition to counter the activities of Daesh or Isil in the Middle East and of course we have expressed our deepest sympathy to the people of France, consequent upon the shocking terrorist attacks in Paris last year. Je suis excit\u00e9. Press conference with the two prime ministers very shortly. I did but see him passing by ... Let\u2019s pause for a moment and track the developments of the day. From the sum of the sanctioned leaks, it appears the budget will be about tax cuts that you may or may not get and infrastructure spending that may or may not be new. It will also be about a bunch of other things we don\u2019t yet know about. Stay tuned, things can only improve. In lieu of facts, politics is going full meta. Depending on who you ask, this budget is an economic plan for the future, or an alibi for the past three years, or a budget for the billionaires. Apart from the blizzard of definitive sounding fighting words about something that is yet to happen, Pat Dodson has been sworn in as a Labor senator, at least until the prime minister calls the election. The treasurer Scott Morrison has given a hint that the government may not try and push legislation through the parliament delivering its planned tax cuts for the top 25% of Australian income earners before we hit the campaign trail \u2013 they may have to be an election promise. Labor is continuing to reserve its position on budget measures, including the tax cuts. The government has bowled up several supply bills to make sure the government doesn\u2019t go broke while surround-sound nonsense breaks out for the next eight weeks. That\u2019s about the nub of things. Onwards, a prime ministerial press conference looms. It\u2019s time to take stock of Monday morning. Hang five I\u2019ll post a summary shortly. In the interim, a bit of news. With campaignageddon almost upon us \u2013 my colleague Lenore Taylor and I are planning to embark on a weekly election podcast called Politics Live \u2013 a bit like the blog but with speak singing, on your iPod wireless. We did an election podcast last campaign and it was an enormous amount of fun. Here\u2019s a little preview of Politics Live, the podcast for election 2016. I\u2019d be very happy if you\u2019d subscribe. I\u2019d clap my little hands, actually. I was just going to flip over to the explanatory memorandum to dig out the figures on the supply bills but Malcolm Farnsworth has moved faster than me. Labor has indicated it will support the money bills. (The implication in the agreement is unlike some people, say, in 1975). Down in the House, the government has moved to introduce the supply bills. I mentioned this was on today\u2019s order of business first up this morning. Can\u2019t have government running out of cash during elections. Distinctly inconvenient. Back to the events of the day, Labor has seized on reported comments by the government backbench MP John Alexander that negative gearing has helped make property unaffordable for first-home buyers as evidence the tax deduction must be wound back. According to an ABC report before his appearance on Four Corners on Monday, Alexander said negative gearing had led to a housing market \u201cdominated by speculative investors\u201d. \u201cToo often we see the young couple getting beaten out at the auction and then renting out the very place that they were trying to buy,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst-home buyers have really been unable to compete.\u201d Alexander headed a parliamentary inquiry into housing affordability, which is due to report this year. The Turnbull government has ruled out changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax, arguing driving down the value of Australian homes would harm growth and prosperity. Alexander had some praise for negative gearing, saying: \u201cIt has worked very well when it has provided affordable rental properties. \u201cThe moment that it intrudes on the marketplace and stops young families from buying the house, that\u2019s not ideal. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happened in this moment when interest rates have gotten so low.\u201d Labor\u2019s financial services and superannuation spokesman, Jim Chalmers, said in Canberra on Monday it was \u201cJohn Alexander\u2019s Kelly O\u2019Dwyer moment\u201d, in reference to her statement that Labor\u2019s negative gearing policy would drive up prices in apparent contradiction to government claims it would have the opposite effect. \u201cI mean, twice now we\u2019ve seen members of the Turnbull government completely torpedo the scare campaign, the dishonest, unhinged scare campaign that the prime minister has been proceeding with,\u201d he said. As is our tradition .. Let\u2019s give the last word to the #BrickParliament Back down to the House, Labor is bringing forward a private member\u2019s bill on multinational tax avoidance. The shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh is on about to the top end of town paying their fair share. The private member\u2019s bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to introduce a specific penalty regime for significant global entities with country-by-country reporting obligations. Under the regime proposed by Labor, the maximum penalty for failure to lodge a country-by-country report would be $270,000. The bill also empowers the Commissioner of Taxation to audit firms which still fail to lodge their reports after the maximum financial penalty has been reached. Labor has also used the opportunity to match a recent Turnbull government commitment to create a register of beneficial ownership of shell companies. This decision must have been made in the last week or so. Labor\u2019s proposal would also extend to trusts, which I think goes further than the government\u2019s commitment. Not for the first time, I\u2019ll say bless Paula Matthewson. A retro hot take from the Budget Inc\u2122 stooge factory. There there, Joe. There there. In the same genre, Mitt Romney and the Infinite Sadness. One of my all time favourites. \u201cI live for laughter.\u201d Meanwhile, down in the House, Greens MP Adam Bandt is introducing a bill creating a new government statutory authority to oversee the planned closure of coal-fired power stations, invest in clean renewable energy, support affected communities through the transition and rewrite energy market laws. Adam Bandt: Our existing energy generators, grid and market are no longer \u2018fit for purpose\u2019. The transition task is huge and requires government coordination if we\u2019re to ensure no-one is left behind. Hmm, fancy seeing you here. As promised, hot from the Budget Inc\u2122 stooge factory, here\u2019s the prime minister and the treasurer looking distinctly pleased with themselves in the prime ministerial suite. Not a cigar or an awkward hand gesture in sight. Gather round. Have you seen my graphs? They are lovely. William Bowe in Crikey has produced a good read on the high court challenge on the Senate voting reform package. A hearing on that matter will happen this afternoon. Subscribers can read that piece here. Here\u2019s his conclusion. Not hopeful for Bob Day. On any score, a ruling to strike down the reforms would defy a long tradition of the high court deferring to the sovereignty of parliament in relation to such matters. Failing a very considerable surprise, the prime minister should be free to pursue his widely reported plan to visit the governor-general on Friday or Saturday, kicking off a gruelling eight-week campaign ahead of a July 2 double dissolution election. Photographers have been called down to the prime minister\u2019s office to capture the traditional budget eve photograph with the PM and the treasurer casually thumbing the budget papers in front of a pack with cameras \u2013 because that\u2019s how things roll. Come in, watch me with this budget book. Mmmmm. Budget book. I\u2019m trying to remember when that particularly peak awkward shot of Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey was taken \u2013 2014? 2015? This one is from 2015. Time flies when you are having all the fun times. Other classics of the \u201con three, look natural\u201d genre. All hail the budget tree, a thing of beauty. Meanwhile, down in the courtyard, Greens leader Richard Di Natale is joining in let\u2019s define the budget. This is a budget for billionaires, not a budget for ordinary Australians. A few more lovely frames of welcome for Pat Dodson. Pat Dodson, minus the famous hat. There\u2019s also a picture coming of Dodson sans hat but I should cover off a rhetoric warning that I didn\u2019t stretch to while the treasurer was looking at things in Queanbeyan. Morrison has obviously had time to speed read Bill Shorten\u2019s new memoir, which I pointed you to earlier today. Scott Morrison: I notice today that Bill Shorten says he wants to run the country like a union. Well, I can assure you in this budget we won\u2019t be going to the accounting standards of the union movement ... we all know what they do when it comes to book keeping in the union movement and with credit cards. Bill Shorten certainly wants to put Australia\u2019s future on the credit card with a higher tax burden on the Australian economy. That will not support companies like Lintech here to drive jobs and growth needed for our economic future. (You see what he did there, right?) A bit of Pat Dodson now, being sworn in. Would Labor work with the government to get tax cuts passed this week? Chris Bowen: Scott Morrison couldn\u2019t answer questions this morning about the legislative approach. We have made our position clear on appropriations, on supply, as you would expect, as a responsible opposition. If Scott Morrison can\u2019t outline a process, we\u2019ll wait to see the process before responding in detail. Bowen is being pushed now on whether Labor would support tax cuts for workers or for business. The shadow treasurer says given the treasurer won\u2019t confirm what\u2019s in the budget Labor won\u2019t speculate about its response until it sees the detail on Tuesday. Bowen says most Australians would miss out on the mooted tax cut. The median income in Australia is about $64,000 and the average income of all wage earners is about $60,000 and about 75% of earners would miss out on a tax cut that cut in at $80,000. The treasurer appears unaware of that. A small definitional war has now broken out about the budget. I pointed out first up that Morrison contends tomorrow\u2019s budget is not a budget but an economic plan. Now the shadow treasurer Chris Bowen has joined the fray. Tomorrow night\u2019s budget is an attempted alibi for the last three years. The Labor leader Bill Shorten, deputy Tanya Plibersek, and a clutch of lower house frontbenchers have come over to witness the Dodson swearing in. Down in the House, Labor\u2019s Anthony Albanese is pointing out a hiccup in private member\u2019s business courtesy of the proroguing of the parliament. He\u2019s talking about absurd propositions enabling parliament to function. Dodson has been sworn in. A large line of greeters has ensued. The chambers are whirring into life. Pat Dodson is about to be sworn in in the red place. Mr President, a new senator approaches the Senate chamber! Well, according to the ABS: Full-time earnings for men and women are currently $80,927. If you want male full-time earnings, that\u2019s $87,604. If you want female full-time earnings, that\u2019s $69,846. But if you want everyone \u2013 average earnings across the board \u2013 which includes people who work full-time and part-time and casually, that\u2019s $59,571. If you want one last fact, if you earn $80,000 you are in the top 25% of income earners in Australia. Me, in the office, to Greg Jericho, who is sitting directly over my computer screen, can you give me the figures on average earnings? We need to fact check the treasurer. So many possible captions here. I\u2019ll leave this one to you good people. Quick bit of translation. One of the key process questions doing the rounds today is about the tax cuts floated for budget night \u2013 will the government try and legislate them before parliament rises, or will they fall back to the category of Coalition election promise \u2013 we promise to give you a tax cut after the election and backdate them to our nominated start date. Promise. Morrison isn\u2019t saying one way or another, only that budget measures will be legislated in the usual way, which is a brave locution given so much of previous Coalition budgets haven\u2019t quite made it out of the Senate in one piece. But these are brave times. Q: How many workers here do you think will expect some tax cuts come tomorrow night? Scott Morrison: They\u2019ll find out the same time you will tomorrow night. Q: Is there a scheme used for public transport for both Melbourne and Sydney? That\u2019s not what the former PM Tony Abbott would have done. Scott Morrison: How so? Q: Firstly, that scheme was reserved for rail outside of the cities. Why this turn around now? Scott Morrison: The prime minister made it very clear when he became prime minister that he knows that rail and public rail in particular is an important part of the productivity and functionality of our cities. So we make no apologies for investing in things that improves Australia\u2019s productivity, supports jobs and supports growth. The asset recycling initiative introduced by my predecessor and Tony Abbott has been a very important initiative for getting funds and to leverage state governments into turning assets they held before into more productive infrastructure now. The announcements that I confirm today are doing just that. This has been a positive partnership with the states and territories and it\u2019s good to work with them. Q: Have you allocated money ... treasurer, taking into account full-time, part-time and casual workers, is someone on $80,000 an average income earner? Scott Morrison: The average full-time earnings in Australia is $80,000. Thank you. Q: The prime minister told us to expect substantial tax reform tomorrow. Is that the kind of language you\u2019d use? Scott Morrison: What we are doing in the budget tomorrow night is backing in companies like Lintek. This is not a time to be throwing money around, you have to spend money wisely, you have to target it and the ultimate test is will it drive jobs and growth. Q: Does supporting these businesses involve a company tax cut? Scott Morrison: All of that will be revealed tomorrow night in the budget. Q: Any budget measures need legislating before parliament is dissolved at the end of the week? Scott Morrison: It will be legislated in the normal way. Q: There will be tax cuts in the budget, will you try to legislate that before the end of this week, and can workers at this factory at Lintek expect to see income tax relief tomorrow night? Scott Morrison: Again those details will be spelt out in the budget tomorrow night and the legislative program will follow the usual course. There will be some special appropriation bills that will come into the House of Representatives today, which deals with the unusual situation we have, going to an election on 2 July, and that will ensure continuity of supply over the course of the election period. But the budget will be legislated in the usual way. With P\u2019s appropriately muffled, here\u2019s Scott Morrison in Queanbeyan. The company he\u2019s visiting this morning is the hope of the side in the transitioning economy, Morrison says. No pressure or anything. Stop the P\u2019s. Mike Bowers is keeping morale high. He\u2019s gone full arthouse with the Family First Senator Bob Day at the doors this morning. This is Mike\u2019s photographic depiction of the rising waters of history subsuming crossbench senators in the coming double dissolution. He\u2019s termed this portrait, glug glug. Day is leading the legal challenge to the new Senate voting reform regime in the high court. That matter is being heard today. I\u2019ll keep an eye on that to the extent that I can. The government is pushing new infrastructure spending in the budget as a key theme this morning. Morrison told the Australian in an interview NSW would get $2.2bn and Victoria $2.4bn in the budget. Labor\u2019s infrastructure spokesman, Anthony Albanese, is warning voters to keep the champagne on ice. There is no new infrastructure investment coming from this budget. This was a fund that was set up essentially to say the only way that we will fund infrastructure for public transport is if state governments sell their assets. The assets that people own. Just so you know, I\u2019m making no analytical calls on the budget one way or another until I\u2019ve seen the document. Governments always use the week before the budget to leak or drop various things that frame expectations for Tuesday night. That exercise may or may not accurately represent the tone and substance of the statement as a whole. So while I\u2019ll report all breaking developments, my practice in terms of commentary is to wait until we\u2019ve seen the document as a whole. As we speak the treasurer, Scott Morrison, is motoring to the marginal seat of Eden-Monaro to look at things, which is standard operating procedure ahead of budgets-to-be-followed-in-quick-succession-by-election-campaigns. Is this a sausage I see before me? Meanwhile the Liberal senator Cory Bernardi is keeping it chilled. Always wise not to peak too soon. Too late to turn back now. Federal parliament\u2019s newest recruit, arriving for business at the Senate doors. Again while we have time, Bill Shorten has produced a campaign eve memoir which includes some remarks about how he conceives leadership. Some people think strong leadership means telling people what they must do or being the smartest person in the room. That\u2019s wasn\u2019t my view as a unionist, and nor is it my view now as Labor leader. Real leadership shows that consensus and negotiation is a sign of strength, not weakness. Real leadership means understanding the minimum and the maximum that people will accept. You go for the maximum, yet always understand the minimum. In every negotiation I have been involved in, I refer to the 90:10 rule \u2013 let\u2019s work on the 90% we agree on, not the 10% where we differ. This is the belief I have carried into politics. As Labor leader, I still think like an organiser. Whether it\u2019s dealing with the rising influence of vested interests or solving a community-level problem, empowering people is the key. Relationships are crucial: get people to come together, define their position and work from there. Don\u2019t begin with a pure ideological solution. Take account of all viewpoints. It\u2019s published today as a ebook by MUP. Just while we have time, an interesting story from Dennis Shanahan in the Australian today. Peace in our time. Let the church bells ring. Malcolm Turnbull has taken the first tentative election campaign steps to settle the ferocious feud with powerful broadcaster Alan Jones that led the Prime Minister to black-ban Sydney\u2019s highest \u00adrating radio network. Turnbull has personally reached out to Jones, whose breakfast show on 2GB is also \u00adcarried in Brisbane and parts of Queensland, as a first step in \u00adpotentially ending his boycott of the entire network. A private meeting was scheduled in Sydney two weeks ago but was postponed when Jones became ill. There is expected to be another attempt at a reconcil\u00adiation this week. If you\u2019ve missed this whole saga let me cut a long story short. Liberal folks view 2GB as the direct line to their base. The prime minister, who famously declared at some point while still communications minister that he was a cabinet minister and as a consequence of that would not be bullied by Jones, has been too busy to appear on GB since becoming prime minister. This \u201ctalk to the hand\u201d disposition has not gone unnoticed, either by GB, or by conservatives, who view the prime minister\u2019s choice as further proof that he is a secret communist. This rapprochement was inevitable. But I\u2019d keep popcorn on hand for the reunion interview if I were you. The education minister, Simon Birmingham, has been deployed on the wireless to back in the government\u2019s school funding plan, which contains a lot less money than Labor\u2019s school funding plan. Won\u2019t this trigger a fight with state governments, who want the Gonski plan implemented in full, Birmingham is asked on the ABC\u2019s AM program? Simon Birmingham: States will always ask for more money. It\u2019s predictable as night following day. On another radio network, the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has told listeners that the government doesn\u2019t have to approve every single foreign investment transaction, and in fact, if the government approved another forty foreign investment transactions like the Kidman and Co sale, then \u201cthey\u2019ll own all our agricultural land.\u201d \u201cThey\u201d, one presumes, is China. China apparently has a secret plan to buy all the agricultural land in Australia. #YouKnowItMakesSense. Joyce goes on to tell listeners on Radio National that he thinks Australia\u2019s superannuation funds should buy up farm land. He professes frustration that super funds aren\u2019t doing that. I suspect super account holders might be the ones expressing frustration if super funds started allocating their savings into dicey investments that impacted their returns. But perhaps that\u2019s just me, worried about fund performance and about having enough savings to fund my retirement. Yes, I am a deeply strange person. Joyce says the Australian government has the right to say no to foreign investors. Yes, indeed it does. It\u2019s called the national interest test. It\u2019s been the test for transactions like the Kidman sale for a goodly period of time. Economic nationalism is in full swing this election season. #Straya is being shouted from the rooftops. Good times. Good morning good people of blogue and welcome to budget week, which is always epic, and will be particularly epic this year, given its proximity to the election campaign. It\u2019s great to be back with you on Politics Live for what I suspect will be a long stint. I hope you are rested, hydrated, and have set your tolerance levels to extreme nonsense. It\u2019s Monday in Canberra, budget eve. Winter is finally threatening to arrive. The leaf blowers are in full swing. The budget tree in the courtyard is trying to blaze into its full glory which is difficult, given its been a bizarrely hot autumn in the national capital. The newspapers are full of various budget crumbs. Tax cuts for workers earning over $80,000 that apparently kick in on election eve, a company tax cut, infrastructure spending. Both the treasurer, Scott Morrison and the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, were interviewed on television networks yesterday to help set up budget week. Apparently tomorrow is not a budget, but an economic plan. Scott Morrison: This budget is an economic plan. It\u2019s an economic plan for jobs and growth and a stronger new economy, a more diversified economy. That\u2019s what Australia needs. This is not a typical budget, I agree with you on that, it\u2019s not a typical budget because this economic plan is so essential to the country\u2019s future. No, it\u2019s not a typical budget in this sense. We will have the budget tomorrow, then we will have Labor\u2019s budget-in-reply on Thursday night, before Malcolm Turnbull makes a mad dash to the governor-general to open the longest election campaign since the mid-1980s. Reasonably atypical set of circumstances, that. Apart from today\u2019s what\u2019s in the budget game, we have the resumption of parliamentary business. The House will consider the money bills required to stop government running out of cash during the election period, the High Court will consider a challenge to the new Senate voting rules, and Labor\u2019s newest Senator Pat Dodson will take his place in the red chamber before leaving it for a campaign. Believe me. There has never been a more exciting time to run around like a headless chook. Enough with my preamble. Today\u2019s comments thread is wide open for your business. Magic Mike and I are up and about on the twits \u2013 he\u2019s @mpbowers and I\u2019m @murpharoo If you speak Facebook you can join my daily forum here. And if you want a behind the scenes look at the day and the looming campaign, give Mike a follow on Instagram. You can find him here. Happy times. Here comes Monday.",

The horror. The horror.<br /></li> <li><strong>Barnaby Joyce</strong> thought he\u2019d talk about carp eradication in question time, proving once again his enduring talent for making a scene.<br /></li> <li>The high court began hearing a challenge to the new senate voting reform laws.</li> </ul> <p>Apart from that, everyone conserved energy, more or less.

Stick to the legal nitty gritty, was CJ\u2019s advice.</p> <p>The essence of Day\u2019s argument was that the choice of voting above-the-line or below-the-line created different methods of voting, in breach of the constitution which requires only one method of voting.</p> <p>Whereas an above-the-line vote under the old system equated to a comprehensive vote for all the candidates under the line, under the new system a vote above the line might exhaust if the parties\u2019 candidates are knocked out. King said this meant voters had to choose whether to vote by what he called a first-past-the-post or optional preferential voting method.</p> <p>King said parties had a \u201cjust vote 1 above the line campaign in their back pockets\u201d which when rolled out would amount to \u201cplumping the vote, and denying independents and minor parties the support they\u2019d have under a full preferential voting system\u201d.</p> <p>Questions from the bench were highly sceptical, noting voters still retained the choice of whether to vote above or below the line regardless of what parties told them to do.</p> <p>Day\u2019s counsel is halfway through his arguments, the hearing resumes at 10:15 tomorrow morning.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5726f4e9e4b0f300275c82c7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-02T06:37:46.332Z\">7.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For folks keen to swot mightily for budget day tomorrow, my colleague <strong>Gareth Hutchens</strong> has complied an incredibly handy ready reckoner about known knowns and unknown unknowns in the economic statement/the alibi for the past three years/budget for billionaires.

Turnbull has personally reached out to Jones, whose breakfast show on 2GB is also \u00adcarried in Brisbane and parts of Queensland, as a first step in \u00adpotentially ending his boycott of the entire network. A private meeting was scheduled in Sydney two weeks ago but was postponed when Jones became ill. There is expected to be another attempt at a reconcil\u00adiation this week.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you\u2019ve missed this whole saga let me cut a long story short. Liberal folks view 2GB as the direct line to their base. The prime minister, who famously declared at some point while still communications minister that he was a cabinet minister and as a consequence of that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/feb/10/malcolm-turnbull-politicians-must-resist-being-bullied-by-likes-of-alan-jones\">would not be bullied by Jones</a>, has been too busy to appear on GB since becoming prime minister.</p> <p>This \u201ctalk to the hand\u201d disposition has not gone unnoticed, either by GB, or by conservatives, who view the prime minister\u2019s choice as further proof that he is a secret communist.

Won\u2019t this trigger a fight with state governments, who want the Gonski plan implemented in full, Birmingham is asked on the ABC\u2019s AM program?</p> <p><strong>Simon Birmingham:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>States will always ask for more money. It\u2019s predictable as night following day.</p> </blockquote> <p>On another radio network, the deputy prime minister, <strong>Barnaby Joyce</strong>, has told listeners that the government doesn\u2019t have to approve every single foreign investment transaction, and in fact, if the government approved another forty foreign investment transactions like the Kidman and Co sale, then \u201c<strong>they\u2019ll</strong> own all our agricultural land.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u201d, one presumes, is China. China apparently has a secret plan to buy all the agricultural land in Australia. #YouKnowItMakesSense.</p> <p>Joyce goes on to tell listeners on Radio National that he thinks Australia\u2019s superannuation funds should buy up farm land. He professes frustration that super funds aren\u2019t doing that. I suspect super account holders might be the ones expressing frustration if super funds started allocating their savings into dicey investments that impacted their returns. But perhaps that\u2019s just me, worried about fund performance and about having enough savings to fund my retirement. Yes, I am a deeply strange person.</p> <p>Joyce says the Australian government has the right to say no to foreign investors. Yes, indeed it does. It\u2019s called the national interest test. It\u2019s been the test for transactions like the Kidman sale for a goodly period of time.</p> <p>Economic nationalism is in full swing this election season. #Straya is being shouted from the rooftops.

Without the partnership of sharing and guidance, sex with another person can be lonely and embarrassing.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist specialising in sexual disorders.</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to </em><a href=\"private.lives@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><em>private.lives@theguardian.com</em></a><em> (please don\u2019t send attachments).

      "bodyText": "Florence Foster Jenkins Hugh Grant and Meryl Streep have some lovely chemistry in this bittersweet sentimental comedy, based on a true story. Streep plays Florence Foster Jenkins, a wealthy 1940s socialite who believed she was a wonderful soprano despite being embarrassingly tone-deaf; Grant plays her wayward but adoring husband and manager. PB \u20226 May (all dates are UK release dates). Everybody Wants Some!! Richard Linklater, creator of the real-time masterpiece Boyhood, returns with a movie which seems rooted in the slacker world of his earlier films \u2013 with a deceptive hint of National Lampoon\u2019s Animal House. It\u2019s the 80s, and we follow a group of college students as they goof off, make out etc. Yet there\u2019s something more reflective, too. PB \u202213 May. Mustang A complex, intelligent and hugely admired debut from the Turkish film-maker Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven, co-written with French director Alice Winocour. A quintet of orphaned teen sisters have some innocent fun on the beach with some boys, and their fierce grandma accuses them of loose morals, imprisons them in the house and orders them to prepare for marriage. It\u2019s a story from Turkey with a very European flavour. PB \u202213 May. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot The title encodes an expression which in times of stress becomes Whiskey Tango Alpha Foxtrot. 30 Rock\u2019s Tina Fey, the empress of American comedy, plays Kim, a game but chaotic journalist covering Iraq and Afghanistan, and emotionally out of her depth. The movie is based on a memoir by the real-life war correspondent Kim Barker. PB \u202213 May. X-Men: Apocalypse The superhero movies just keep on coming. Bryan Singer directs this new outing for Marvel\u2019s X-Men, including Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s Mystique, who must battle a mutant, Apocalypse, played by Oscar Isaac. The film will have to reach high to match Quicksilver\u2019s wonderful slo-mo sequence, to Jim Croce\u2019s Time in a Bottle, in X-Men: Days of Future Past. PB \u202218 May. Sing Street Irish film-maker John Carney plucked the world\u2019s heartstrings on screen and then stage with his musical Once. Now he\u2019s back with this winningly nostalgic tale of a teenager in 1980s Dublin who dreams of being in a band. This sweet-natured movie has won comparison with The Commitments. PB \u202220 May. Love and Friendship Jane Austen adaptations are in the air, what with the Pride and Prejudice and Zombies mashup and Curtis Sittenfeld\u2019s new novel Eligible, also a reworking of P&amp;P; now Whit Stillman releases his droll and elegant version of Austen\u2019s early novella Lady Susan, with Kate Beckinsale in the lead. PB \u202227 May. Alice Through the Looking Glass A follow-up to Tim Burton\u2019s Alice, still with Mia Wasikowska as Alice, Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen. Burton has ceded directorial responsibilities to British film-maker James Bobin. The 2010 film was a big hit, so this will have something to live up to. PB \u202227 May. Warcraft: The Beginning The fantasy role-playing game Warcraft \u2013 already rolled out in the form of video games, novels, comics and a myriad of collectibles \u2013 now has a movie iteration. The peaceful realm of Azeroth is threatened by an orc incursion. Duncan Jones (who made Moon and Source Code) directs. PB \u202230 May. The Nice Guys Shane Black is the veteran action writer-director who gave us the cult hit Kiss Kiss Bang Bang in 2005 and hit serious paydirt with Iron Man 3. His new film is a comedy crime noir set in 70s LA, and features the mouthwatering pairing of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling: they are a private detective and his associate who investigate the death of a porn star. PB \u20223 June. Where to Invade Next Maybe the Obama years have caused a mellowing and a brightening in the great man, because Michael Moore\u2019s new documentary isn\u2019t an attack on American military ambitions. Actually, it\u2019s a friendly tour of other countries \u2013 an \u201cinvasion\u201d designed to cherry pick the best social welfare ideas from places such as France, Portugal and Finland. PB \u202210 June. Fire at Sea Italian film-maker Gianfranco Rosi earned a cult following for his documentary about Rome, Sacro GRA. This new movie won him the Golden Bear at Berlin. It\u2019s a powerful documentary study of Lampedusa, tracking its frontline experience of the refugee crisis over a year. PB \u202210 June. The Conjuring 2 The first chiller about the real-life 1970s paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren \u2013 who later became famous for their involvement in the Amityville affair \u2013 went over nicely at the box office. Now they are back, played again by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, and travelling to London to investigate a haunting. PB \u202217 June. Tale of Tales Matteo Garrone\u2019s excursion into rococo fantasy and myth is one of the most gloriously strange films of the year: fabular and fabulous. It is taken from the 16th-century Italian folk tales of Giambattista Basile, and it is bizarre, hilarious and erotic, with hints of Python and Blackadder. There is a glorious performance from Toby Jones as an eccentric king and great turns from Vincent Cassel, John C Reilly and Salma Hayek. PB \u202217 June. Elvis and Nixon Forget about Batman and Superman: this is the really freaky pairing: a real-life meeting in 1970, immortalised in a famously bizarre formal handshake photo. Elvis Presley had showed up unannounced at the White House, and wanted the President to swear him in as an undercover drug enforcement agent. Ironic, considering his consumption of prescription medication. Michael Shannon is Elvis and Kevin Spacey, of course, is Tricky Dicky. PB \u202224 June. Independence Day: Resurgence Belated follow-up to the popular 1996 alien-invasion blockbuster, which featured Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum saving the planet alongside Clinton-esque prez Bill Pullman. Smith isn\u2019t returning, but a second battle feet of the same extra-terrestrial nasties apparently will be \u2013 and pretty much everyone else, including director Roland Emmerich. Liam Hemsworth is the main new addition. AP \u202224 June. Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie The success of The Inbetweeners Movie has given a new lease of life to British TV sitcom spin-off films, and Jennifer Saunders\u2019 PR-spoofing show follows Dad\u2019s Army into cinemas. It doesn\u2019t sound like the fruit will fall too far from the tree with this one. Saunders and Joanna Lumley will return as Edina and Patsy, with one of the show\u2019s directors, Mandie Fletcher, getting the nod for the feature. Sanders and co are clearly not afraid of the curse of the celebrity cameo: dozens have been announced, including Graham Norton, Twiggy, and Elton John. AP \u20221 July. Maggie\u2019s Plan Rebecca Miller, the writer and director of Personal Velocity and The Private Lives of Pippa Lee, has come up with a more conventional comic premise for her fifth feature: Greta Gerwig plays a woman whose plan to have a baby on her own goes awry when she meets and marries Ethan Hawke\u2019s hunky academic. The film did well at its premiere at Toronto, with Julianne Moore receiving lots of plaudits for playing Hawke\u2019s Danish-accented ex-wife. AP \u20228 July. The Legend of Tarzan The latest film about Edgar Rice Burroughs\u2019 tree-swinger features Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd as a more mature Lord Greystoke, back in central Africa years after the \u201cclassic\u201d Tarzan period. The last live-action Tarzan was 20 years ago, so perhaps we are ready for this expensive reboot. Harry Potter maestro David Yates is in charge of this one; only time will tell if he has another franchise on his hands. AP \u20228 July. Ghostbusters The first emanation from the new \u201cGhostbusters universe\u201d is the much touted female-fronted one, with the Bridesmaids one-two of Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig joined by SNL\u2019s Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones for more ghost-busting shenanigans. This caught a bit of flak after the trailer appeared to show African American Jones confined to a non-scientist, \u201cstreet\u201d type role; though whether it will pan out like that remains to be seen. If the release goes well, though, there\u2019ll be more Ghostbusters \u2013 a male-fronted one, and a cartoon \u2013 coming down the pipe. AP \u202215 July. Star Trek Beyond The third in the latest cycle of Star Trek films (but the 13th feature version overall). With JJ Abrams otherwise occupied on the Star Wars franchise, Justin \u201cFast &amp; Furious\u201d Lin steps into the director\u2019s role. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are back as Kirk and Spock, with Simon Pegg adding script duties to his regular role as Scotty. Not much has been revealed, other than that Idris Elba plays the villain Krall, and that the crew are stranded on a planet after being attacked \u201cby a powerful, unstoppable wave of unknown aliens\u201d. So it\u2019s as you were, basically. AP \u202222 July. The BFG Roald Dahl\u2019s 1982 novel was turned into an animated film in 1989, but now Steven Spielberg has made a live-action version, and it looks like it could be summer\u2019s big family blockbuster. Man of the moment Mark Rylance is the amiable giant who kidnaps a little girl to help him defeat a tribe of menacing man-eating giants. Spielberg has cast an unknown, 11-year-old Ruby Barnhill, opposite Rylance. This sort of kids\u2019 fantasy tends to bring out Spielberg\u2019s best qualities; definitely one to look forward to. AP \u202222 July. Finding Dory Pixar\u2019s new one is a sequel to its 2003 hit Finding Nemo (you know: clownfish, lost, Willem Dafoe, sharks). Here, the focus is on Nemo\u2019s forgetful pal Dory (Ellen DeGeneres, in the original as well as this), who embarks on a quest to find her family in California. The moderate response to 2015\u2019s The Good Dinosaur took a bit of the gloss off Pixar\u2019s reputation, and Finding Dory would seem at this distance to be solid rather than inspired. But we\u2019re happy to be proved wrong. AP \u202229 July. Jason Bourne Paul Greengrass is back in the Bourne saddle for the first time since 2007\u2019s Bourne Ultimatum (after taking a break for 2012\u2019s not universally admired Bourne Legacy). This one seems to be an attempt to recalibrate the spy series as an open-ended franchise. Not a lot of info is available, other than a trailer that suggests Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is indeed back, and he\u2019s protecting former contact Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles). Alicia Vikander is the most eye-catching new recruit to the series, playing some sort of agency aide, while Riz Ahmed is along for the ride, too. AP \u202229 July. Suicide Squad A supervillain match-up movie featuring the Joker, Deadshot, Boomerang et al, as part of DC Comics\u2019 belated attempt to rival Marvel\u2019s \u201cextended universe\u201d blockbusters. Having seen Batman v Superman flounder if not exactly flop, DC will be pinning a lot of hopes on this. Directed by Fury\u2019s David Ayer, it stars the likes of Will Smith, Jared Leto and Margot Robbie, and has the baddies teaming up in a task force to save the world. If this doesn\u2019t work, there\u2019s the Justice League movie just over the hill \u2026 AP \u20225 August. David Brent: Life on the Road Another TV spin-off \u2013 this time more likely to appeal to the Alpha Papa crowd rather than the Dad\u2019s Army one. Ricky Gervais dusts down his fondly remembered Office alter ego David Brent for a feature-length outing, which he wrote, directs and stars in. He seems to be trying a bit harder than most spin-offers: Brent is trying to rekindle his dreams of music-biz stardom in this one. If the trailer is anything to go by, Gervais will also be taking advantage of cinema\u2019s less restrictive morals, with some nuclear-level potty-mouthing. AP \u202219 August. Swallows and Amazons Arthur Ransome\u2019s classic kids\u2019 yarn is adapted for the screen for the first time since 1974. Inevitably, though, the much giggled-over character name Titty has been changed \u2026 to Tatty. There is a cast of biggish names \u2013 Rafe Spall, Kelly Macdonald, Harry Enfield \u2013 and a newly inserted plot strand about a suspicious-looking spy, apparently inspired by Ransome\u2019s own \u201cdiplomatic\u201d activities on both sides during his time in revolutionary Russia. Lots of splendid Lake District countryside, however, is assured. AP \u202219 August. Ben-Hur This is one of those remakes that no one had particularly asked for. But, possibly inspired by the rise of the faith film audience, the \u201ctale of the Christ\u201d is to get another workout. Boardwalk Empire\u2019s Jack Huston steps into the Charlton Heston role of the Jewish prince forced into slavery by the Romans; Toby Kebbell is Messala, the former childhood friend he takes on in a chariot race. It isn\u2019t likely, if we\u2019re honest, to match the 1959 version\u2019s 11 Oscars \u2013 but is potentially an entertaining romp all the same. AP \u202226 August. Julieta Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s unlikely take on the work of Canadian short-story maestro Alice Munro has acquired some distracting notoriety, after the Spanish auteur and his brother were named in the Panama Papers; Almod\u00f3var promptly withdrew from press activity. Julieta, which will premiere at Cannes, features Emma Su\u00e1rez (best known for her work with Julio Medem) as a woman looking for her runaway daughter. AP \u202226 August. War Dogs Todd Phillips, king of the stoner-bromance movie, goes a tad more heavyweight here, with this arms-trading comedy (you heard that right) based on a non-fiction book called Arms and the Dudes. Miles Teller and Jonah Hill play the Miami stoners who luck into a $300m contract to supply guns to the military in Afghanistan. Producer Bradley Cooper has a supporting role as a major league arms dealer. AP \u202226 August.",

It doesn\u2019t sound like the fruit will fall too far from the tree with this one. Saunders and Joanna Lumley will return as Edina and Patsy, with one of the show\u2019s directors, Mandie Fletcher, getting the nod for the feature.

With JJ Abrams otherwise occupied on the Star Wars franchise, Justin \u201cFast &amp; Furious\u201d Lin steps into the director\u2019s role. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are back as Kirk and Spock, with Simon Pegg adding script duties to his regular role as Scotty. Not much has been revealed, other than that Idris Elba plays the villain Krall, and that the crew are stranded on a planet after being attacked \u201cby a powerful, unstoppable wave of unknown aliens\u201d.

Man of the moment Mark Rylance is the amiable giant who kidnaps a little girl to help him defeat a tribe of menacing man-eating giants. Spielberg has cast an unknown, 11-year-old Ruby Barnhill, opposite Rylance.

Here, the focus is on Nemo\u2019s forgetful pal Dory (Ellen DeGeneres, in the original as well as this), who embarks on a quest to find her family in California. The moderate response to 2015\u2019s The Good Dinosaur took a bit of the gloss off Pixar\u2019s reputation, and Finding Dory would seem at this distance to be solid rather than inspired.

This one seems to be an attempt to recalibrate the spy series as an open-ended franchise. Not a lot of info is available, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/22/jason-bourne-trailer-things-we-learned-matt-damon-julia-stiles\">other than a trailer</a> that suggests Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is indeed back, and he\u2019s protecting former contact Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles).

Ricky Gervais dusts down his fondly remembered Office alter ego David Brent for a feature-length outing, which he wrote, directs and stars in. He seems to be trying a bit harder than most spin-offers: Brent is trying to rekindle his dreams of music-biz stardom in this one. If <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/07/ricky-gervais-david-brent-life-on-the-road-trailer\">the trailer</a> is anything to go by, Gervais will also be taking advantage of cinema\u2019s less restrictive morals, with some nuclear-level potty-mouthing. <strong>AP</strong><br />\u202219 August.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"befeba61ab49bb37ae9d95d258979f5c0849542e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/befeba61ab49bb37ae9d95d258979f5c0849542e/472_58_2225_1335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ricky Gervais as David Brent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ricky Gervais as David Brent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Planet Photos/BBC Films/PLANET PHOTOS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Swallows and Amazons</h2> <p>Arthur Ransome\u2019s classic kids\u2019 yarn is adapted for the screen for the first time since 1974. Inevitably, though, the much giggled-over character name Titty has been changed \u2026 to Tatty. There is a cast of biggish names \u2013 Rafe Spall, Kelly Macdonald, Harry Enfield \u2013 and a newly inserted plot strand about a suspicious-looking spy, apparently inspired by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/13/arthur-ransome-double-agent\">Ransome\u2019s own \u201cdiplomatic\u201d activities</a> on both sides during his time in revolutionary Russia. Lots of splendid Lake District countryside, however, is assured. <strong>AP</strong><br />\u202219 August.</p> <h2>Ben-Hur</h2> <p>This is one of those remakes that no one had particularly asked for. But, possibly inspired by the rise of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/17/faith-films-marketing-miracle\">faith film audience</a>, the \u201ctale of the Christ\u201d is to get another workout. Boardwalk Empire\u2019s Jack Huston steps into the Charlton Heston role of the Jewish prince forced into slavery by the Romans; Toby Kebbell is Messala, the former childhood friend he takes on in a chariot race. It isn\u2019t likely, if we\u2019re honest, to match the 1959 version\u2019s 11 Oscars \u2013 but is potentially an entertaining romp all the same. <strong>AP</strong><br />\u202226 August.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BmeR9GYdDU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3BmeR9GYdDU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>Julieta</h2> <p>Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s unlikely take on the work of Canadian short-story maestro Alice Munro has acquired some distracting notoriety, after the Spanish auteur and his brother were named in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\">Panama Papers</a>; Almod\u00f3var promptly withdrew from press activity.

      "bodyText": "In the 10 years I have spent working as a photographer for men\u2019s lifestyle magazines, I have often felt like a traitor, trading in bums and boobs: images that perpetuate an unproductive and even dangerous archetype of what makes women desirable. But with the recent decline in commercial print publishing, particularly of lads\u2019 mags, it has become imperative to evolve in order to stay relevant. Recently, crossing over into women\u2019s lifestyle publishing (where the boobs and bums may be more petite, skin plentiful and the interviews are often even more cringeworthy), I have realised the grass is not any greener on the other side. A lingerie shoot in a female publication only really varies from one aimed at a male audience by its inclusion of styling credits, and a lower model BMI. In fact this is perhaps an even more toxic cultural wasteland, with its severe retouching standards and consumerist ideals. Are the professionally empowered and educated inadvertently conspiring behind the scenes to keep the others daft and naive? How did we end up this way? To say that I am torn between the ethical issues and doing the ultimate dream job \u2013 flexibility included \u2013 would be an understatement. For the majority of the work, which is in retouching, I keep my own hours. The work can be done from a home studio in my pyjamas \u2013 that\u2019s how centrefolds are \u201cmade\u201d. Retouching is brutal work. The process routinely involves liquefying body contours, grafting skin, augmenting and trimming body silhouettes, transplanting hair, shaving noses and fixing bad makeup. We know about the real state of models\u2019 cellulite and hair-removal habits. If a nipple shows through sheer fabric (or the model is cold) in a shoot for non-nude publications, we recreate lace fabrics, shadows and hair over the area to ensure that they pass editorial standards. In the case of a nude publication, papillae and ducts within the nipple itself must be removed in order to create a Barbie-smooth look. European titles tend to be more forgiving in both respects, but the butchery I have had to commit for American and Australian magazines has been unforgivable. Aside from tolerating a few challenging personalities throughout the years, such as the neurotic makeup artist who hijacked a shoot or the difficult art director who decided all the furniture had to be retouched out of images, working as a photographer has been nothing but a pleasure. The technical challenges are exciting and rewarding, deadlines are bearable and the ability to say, \u201cHey, Mum, I just got a shoot in \u2026\u201d is gratifying. Although the glamour of any profession lies in the public\u2019s thankfully uninformed perception, working with beautiful people is hardly a terrible way to spend one\u2019s day. In fact, the main perk is the people. Models themselves are often vastly intelligent and interesting to speak with behind the scenes. We know exactly what product we are making, and we do it so well that the consumer genuinely believes it is real. Once, during a casting, I was going through a model\u2019s professional website, which included interview clips of her exclaiming \u2013 with no hint of irony, and well placed pauses \u2013 that she had never read a book in full. I dreaded the shoot for weeks, until we were involved directly in an email exchange, in which she was attentive and very articulate. On set, she was probably the most professional person I have ever worked with, and I do not say that lightly. The industry feeds with one hand, on an individual level, and then takes away with the other, from the masses, by means of unhealthy cultural programming and behavioural normalisation. It has been interesting to see how social media has changed the way people view images. Mainstream reporting of important commercial events, such as a Kim Kardashian nude shoot, now generate interest not from the lads\u2019 mag crowd, but also from a very vocal audience of vastly heterosexual females, who now more than ever are able to look up to or deconstruct these ideals. But as content is increasingly available online, its value is reduced. This new generation of free-content producers is quite literally putting us out of business \u2013 and at the same time it lacks the legal protections and controlled distribution afforded to professional models and photographers. Fellow dinosaurs from the print world still do not quite know what to make of this and how to work with it. Many of us have found ourselves fleeing to other vocations in search of a stable pay cheque to make rent day, a mere 10 years after the glory days of print, when one double-page spread would cover a photographer\u2019s basic financial needs for a month. I am currently stuck in a strangely privileged place \u2013 disillusioned and bitter, yet enjoying being one of the survivors. I manage to keep production costs down and have dramatically increased my work output to cope and adapt. Delivery mechanisms for images are changing. In the early 2000s it was film v digital, in the 2010s pirate v purchased, and in 2016 pro v amateur. As Playboy publishes images of Instagram girls, it\u2019s all still the same \u2026 but yet so very different. \u2022 Are you a lawyer, a lorry driver, a PR?

But with the recent decline in commercial print publishing, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/17/fhm-zoo-magazines-suspend-publication\" title=\"\">particularly of lads\u2019 mags</a>, it has become imperative to evolve in order to stay relevant.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/25/secret-life-archaeologist-soil-sandwiches-sexism-sites\">The secret life of an archaeologist: soil in your sandwiches and sexism on sites | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently, crossing over into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/28/things-i-wish-womens-magazines-would-publish\" title=\"\">women\u2019s lifestyle publishing</a> (where the boobs and bums may be more petite, skin plentiful and the interviews are often even more cringeworthy), I have realised the grass is not any greener on the other side. A lingerie shoot in a female publication only really varies from one aimed at a male audience by its inclusion of styling credits, and a lower model BMI.</p> <p>In fact this is perhaps an even more toxic cultural wasteland, with its severe retouching standards and consumerist ideals. Are the professionally empowered and educated inadvertently conspiring behind the scenes to keep the others daft and naive? How did we end up this way?</p> <p>To say that I am torn between the ethical issues and doing the ultimate dream job \u2013 flexibility included \u2013 would be an understatement. For the majority of the work, which is in retouching, I keep my own hours. The work can be done from a home studio in my pyjamas \u2013 that\u2019s how centrefolds are \u201cmade\u201d.</p> <p>Retouching is brutal work. The process routinely involves liquefying body contours, grafting skin, augmenting and trimming body silhouettes, transplanting hair, shaving noses and fixing bad makeup. We know about the real state of models\u2019 cellulite and hair-removal habits. If a nipple shows through sheer fabric (or the model is cold) in a shoot for non-nude publications, we recreate lace fabrics, shadows and hair over the area to ensure that they pass editorial standards. In the case of a nude publication, papillae and ducts within the nipple itself must be removed in order to create a Barbie-smooth look. European titles tend to be more forgiving in both respects, but the butchery I have had to commit for American and Australian magazines has been unforgivable.</p> <p>Aside from tolerating a few challenging personalities throughout the years, such as the neurotic makeup artist who hijacked a shoot or the difficult art director who decided all the furniture had to be retouched out of images, working as a photographer has been nothing but a pleasure. The technical challenges are exciting and rewarding, deadlines are bearable and the ability to say, \u201cHey, Mum, I just got a shoot in \u2026\u201d is gratifying. Although the glamour of any profession lies in the public\u2019s thankfully uninformed perception, working with beautiful people is hardly a terrible way to spend one\u2019s day.</p> <p>In fact, the main perk is the people. Models themselves are often vastly intelligent and interesting to speak with behind the scenes. We know exactly what product we are making, and we do it so well that the consumer genuinely believes it is real.</p> <p>Once, during a casting, I was going through a model\u2019s professional website, which included interview clips of her exclaiming \u2013 with no hint of irony, and well placed pauses \u2013 that she had never read a book in full. I dreaded the shoot for weeks, until we were involved directly in an email exchange, in which she was attentive and very articulate. On set, she was probably the most professional person I have ever worked with, and I do not say that lightly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/18/secret-life-brain-surgeon-drilling\">The secret life of a trainee brain surgeon: it\u2019s all about the drilling | Anonymous</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The industry feeds with one hand, on an individual level, and then takes away with the other, from the masses, by means of unhealthy cultural programming and behavioural normalisation.</p> <p>It has been interesting to see how social media has changed the way people view images. Mainstream reporting of important commercial events, such as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/20/why-is-kim-kardashian-famous\" title=\"\">Kim Kardashian nude shoot</a>, now generate interest not from the lads\u2019 mag crowd, but also from a very vocal audience of vastly heterosexual females, who now more than ever are able to look up to or deconstruct these ideals.</p> <p>But as content is increasingly available online, its value is reduced. This new generation of free-content producers is quite literally putting us out of business \u2013 and at the same time it lacks the legal protections and controlled distribution afforded to professional models and photographers.</p> <p>Fellow dinosaurs from the print world still do not quite know what to make of this and how to work with it. Many of us have found ourselves fleeing to other vocations in search of a stable pay cheque to make rent day, a mere 10 years after the glory days of print, when one double-page spread would cover a photographer\u2019s basic financial needs for a month.</p> <p>I am currently stuck in a strangely privileged place \u2013 disillusioned and bitter, yet enjoying being one of the survivors. I manage to keep production costs down and have dramatically increased my work output to cope and adapt.</p> <p>Delivery mechanisms for images are changing. In the early 2000s it was film v digital, in the 2010s pirate v purchased, and in 2016 pro v amateur. As Playboy publishes images of Instagram girls, it\u2019s all still the same \u2026 but yet so very different.</p> <p>\u2022 Are you a lawyer, a lorry driver, a PR?

      "bodyText": "Shakespeare\u2019s history plays are all about contrasts: council chambers and battlefields, city and country, the corridors of power and the world of the streets. High politics and low life. And that\u2019s especially true of Henry IV Parts I and II. Half the time you\u2019re watching England\u2019s rulers sitting in meetings, tearing the country apart; the rest of the time you\u2019re with Hal and Falstaff down the pub. They\u2019re panoptic, these plays, full of so many different kinds of England. All human life is here. The two plays have great similarities, but they\u2019re also in subtly different keys. Part I is brighter and more youthful, the story of Hal and his great rival, Hotspur; Part II is bleaker. Everyone seems to be older. We know that Hal will turn his back on Falstaff, that moment is coming, and it casts a real chill. When Sam Mendes asked me to do the two Henry IVs for The Hollow Crown series in 2012, I hesitated for less than a second. The plan was to film as much on location as possible. It was a very different approach to the last big BBC Shakespeare project, the Complete Works series of the late 1970s and early 80s, which came from the age of studio TV: terrible sound, vision-mixing on the spot, restricted camera setup. We wanted to get away from all that; the whole idea was to take Shakespeare\u2019s history plays out into the country they portrayed. Location scouting was a major part of it. I wanted a high-medieval building to film the court scenes. In the end, we went for Gloucester Cathedral, where they allowed us to clear the whole nave, these wonderful romanesque pillars and vaulted roof, and film in the cloisters. They were rather film-friendly, because they\u2019d recently done Harry Potter. The Eastcheap scenes we shot at Ealing studios. I did a gentle bit of adaptation \u2013 some cutting, a little reordering of scenes. I thought that no one would thank me for making a dull but completist version. But so much of it is already there in Shakespeare\u2019s writing \u2013 the world of Eastcheap, Falstaff\u2019s world, is a warm, genial, comradely world. The court, by contrast, is a world of high politics: men in the medieval equivalent of suits. Hal, this wastrel prince, played in our version by Tom Hiddleston, is the connective tissue between the two. He wants to live in both worlds, have it both ways \u2013 who wouldn\u2019t? Yet when it comes to it, at first in the battle scene of Part I, then properly in Part II, he steps up to the mark. Everyone loves Falstaff, and there\u2019s this idea \u2013 propagated most recently by the US scholar Harold Bloom \u2013 that he\u2019s the icon of bucolic England, this jolly, cosy Father Christmas figure. When Simon Russell Beale and I were discussing it, we felt very strongly that it was the opposite. Falstaff hates the countryside, spends most of his time grousing and grumbling, trying to con people out of money. As with Hal, the characterisation is hugely complex. Neither figure is heroic. Shakespeare constantly shifts things, playing with your sympathies. The scene in Part II where Falstaff visits Shallow and Silence, two countryside justices who knew him years before, is one of the greatest things in all Shakespeare. Everyone is lost in memories of a world that may never have existed. In some ways, the climax of Part I is the extraordinary scene between Hal and Falstaff, a kind of mock-trial in the pub where Falstaff pretends to be Hal\u2019s father, who\u2019s incredibly irritated that Hal is wasting his life, and Hal plays himself, before they swap over. There\u2019s so much going on: father figures, surrogate father figures, the question of what their relationship really is, the foreshadowing of the moment when Hal decides to banish Falstaff once and for all. I decided I wanted to shoot it straight through with two cameras; we\u2019d rehearsed, but never run it through, and I didn\u2019t want the extras to have witnessed it before. It was remarkable: eight minutes long, Simon and Tom both acting their hearts out. It felt so intense and clear. Afterwards, several of the crew asked me whether I\u2019d rewritten it.

With a nicely feminist twist, Philip Feeney has also incorporated music by the 19th-century composer Fanny Mendelssohn into his own newly commissioned score. \u202219 to 21 May, Cast, Doncaster. Then touring. Crystal Pite and Jonathon Young: Betroffenheit The wonderful Crystal Pite collaborates with the theatre director and performer Jonathon Young on this coruscating exploration of grief. Betroffenheit is a term used to describe the verbal and physical disorientation produced by an extreme traumatic state, and Pite takes the starting point of a situation of bereavement and loss, to push the boundaries of her dancers\u2019 physical powers of expression. \u202231 May to 1 June, Sadler\u2019s Wells, London. Royal Ballet mixed bill The last programme in the Royal Ballet\u2019s current season features a new work by Wayne McGregor, a setting of music by the Finnish conductor and composer Esa-Pekka Salonen, renowned for his eclectic contemporary idiom and rhythmic wit. Sharing the bill is a revival of The Invitation, Kenneth MacMillan\u2019s pioneeringly brutal exploration of the sexual dynamics between a young man and woman and an older married couple; also a second outing for Christopher Wheeldon\u2019s lush and finely crafted Within the Golden Hour. \u2022In rep from 28 May to 11 June, Royal Opera House, London. Birmingham Royal Ballet\u2019s Shakespeare triple bill BRB join the Shakespeare 400 celebrations with this mixed programme. Jessica Lang\u2019s new work, Wink, is inspired by the sexual and emotional ambivalence of the sonnets; Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n\u2019s modern dance classic, The Moor\u2019s Pavane, is a distillation of the themes and characters from Othello; and in Shakespeare Suite, director David Bintley uses Duke Ellington\u2019s titular score to choreograph a surreal jazz dance through the Shakespeare oeuvre. \u202222 to 25 June, Birmingham Hippodrome. LA Dance Project This Los Angeles-based dance group was founded in 2012 by the choreographer, dancer and soon-to-be ex-director of Paris Opera Ballet, Benjamin Millepied. Since then, the company has developed an impressive repertory, combining classics from the modern dance repertory with new commissions. This brief UK season features two works by Millepied: Gems 3, created in collaboration with the composer Andy Akiho; and Hearts &amp; Arrows, set to the music of Philip Glass. There\u2019s also a new work Harbour by the always excellent Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui. \u202224 to 25 June, Sadler\u2019s Wells, London. Natalia Osipova and guests The outstanding and unpredictable Russian ballerina has commissioned a programme of new contemporary dance from three, very different choreographers: Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and Arthur Pita (with whom she collaborated on her previous programme, Solo for Two), and Russell Maliphant, who creates a duet for Osipova and her new on- and off-stage partner, Sergei Polunin. \u202229 June to 3 July, Sadler\u2019s Wells, London; 12 to 14 August, Festival theatre, Edinburgh. Australian Ballet season The Australian Ballet, a classical company with a 54-year history, have developed a distinctive relationship with tradition, exemplified by the two works in this short London season. Graeme Murphy rewrites Swan Lake as the story of a dysfunctional royal marriage, with parallels to Charles, Diana and Camilla. In Alexei Ratmansky\u2019s Cinderella, the fairytale is a given a witty update to 20th-century Russia. \u202213 to 23 July, Coliseum, London. The Bolshoi Ballet The great Moscow company return for their regular London season with a mix of familiar classics and some more contemporary repertory. Don Quixote and Swan Lake are inevitably in there, but so is Jean Christophe Maillot\u2019s vivid, playful adaptation of Shakespeare\u2019s Taming of the Shrew, and Alexei Ratmanksy\u2019s reimagining of the old Soviet classic Flames of Paris. Olga Smirnova, Denis Rodkin and Artem Ovcharenko are among the season\u2019s principals. \u202225 July to 13 August, Royal Opera House, London. Scottish Ballet: Edinburgh international festival The Glasgow-based company have carved out a niche for themselves in Scotland\u2019s premiere festival, and this year present what promises to be a superb double bill of 21st-century works. Crystal Pite\u2019s Emergence is a piece of swarming monumental power set to music by Owen Belton; Angelin Preljocaj describes his work MC 14/22 (Ceci Est Mon Corps) as a hymn to the male body \u2013 its capacity for beauty and tenderness, rather than its aggressive force. \u2022 18 to 20 August, Festival theatre, Edinburgh. Jasmin Vardimon Company: Pinocchio Jasmin Vardimon\u2019s talent for vivid dance theatre turns towards a family audience in her new adaptation of the classic tale by Carlo Collodi. Text, dance and an inventive set promise to dramatise the comedy and strangeness of the story, and explore what it means to be human. \u2022 27 to 28 August, Gulbenkian theatre, Kent.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a case of similar titles, different subject matter, with Girl Up by Laura Bates (the Everyday Sexism project), and Man Up, by Rebecca Asher (Shattered: Modern Motherhood And The Illusion of Equality). The former is primarily aimed at the youth-feminism market; the latter, while not unsympathetic to feminism, asks: \u201cWe live in a man\u2019s world, so why do so many boys and men fail to flourish?\u201d Indeed, ironically, the titles flag up the differences: while Girl Up is a play on \u201cman up\u201d, Asher might argue that the very phrase \u201cman up\u201d is a judgment on perceived male weakness and thus part of the problem. In the case of Girl Up (\u201cPart manifesto, part girl guide\u201d), while it is youth-oriented, Bates doesn\u2019t deliver a sanitised \u201csugar-and-spice\u201d tutorial. In the preface, actor Emma Watson observes that the book is \u201cnot for the faint-hearted\u201d, and she ain\u2019t kidding! Alternative titles included Spunk for Girls and Bend Clit Like Beckham, the inside covers feature dancing cartoon vaginas (complete with top hats and canes), and, as seems de rigueur with new-style feminist tomes, there\u2019s some impressive swearing. Bates knows her market \u2013 no self-respecting teenager would want to be caught dead reading something that fails to produce at least a prickle of parental dread. I experienced a couple of pearl-clutching moments myself (one section appears to take masturbating with root vegetables for granted \u2013 is Bates quite sure about this?). However, as Bates, a Cambridge graduate, is doubtless aware, it\u2019s one thing to master earthy no-frills teen-vernacular; quite another feat to get an enduring message across. In the main, Girl Up proves effective at communicating a central idea that is at once very simple and incredibly complicated: far from being weak, fluffy creatures, young women are strong and powerful. \u201cSuperheroes!\u201d declares Bates, going on to detail the forces aligned against them. Everything from societal judgments, double standards, social media pitfalls and street harassment to sexual objectification, pornography, partner abuse, food disorders and body shaming \u2013 citing and interviewing female role models along the way (from Mary Beard and Martha Lane Fox, to Shami Chakrabarti and Bridget Christie). Some of Bates\u2019s positions may prove too hardline for some readers \u2013 such as the matter of sexual consent. Obviously, rape is always rape (not \u201cdate rape\u201d, or any other term that softens or undermines it), but in my opinion it\u2019s possible to have real concerns about grey areas of consent without being in any way a rape apologist. However, Girl Up\u2019s brio more than propels it along. In particular, I enjoyed Bates\u2019s invention of the \u201csexist bullshit klaxon\u201d (in a just world, you\u2019d be able to buy one on Amazon), her defiant rebuttal of the \u201cmean girls\u201d stereotype, the before and after shots of herself posed in a bikini (to demonstrate how Photoshop works), and her robust response to the much droned about phenomenon of \u201cfriend-zoning\u201d: \u201cGirls don\u2019t owe guys sex just for being nice. Seriously, fuck off.\u201d Quite. In Man Up: Boys, Men and Breaking the Male Rules, Asher flags up how boys and men are also stereotyped from a young age (\u201cWhy does society hold this shallow and colourless image of men?\u201d), and how this leads to disturbing statistics. Males are four times more likely to have behavioural difficulties, three times more likely to be excluded from school, and make up 75% of suicides and 95% of the prison population. \u201cMen are still restricted by the straitjacket of the male stereotype,\u201d writes Asher, who has a son and daughter. \u201cThere is growing recognition that the state of masculinity needs reassessment.\u201d There were times when I wasn\u2019t wholly persuaded by Asher\u2019s arguments (I think, despite everything, most men would still choose the \u201cmale breadwinner\u201d pressure over the generic female crapshoot), but Man Up makes for interesting reading. It encompasses the various stages of male existence, from early conditioning (\u201cWe can show boys that they have so many more options than the dominant male stereotype suggests\u201d), through school, young adulthood, fatherhood, and \u201csocial isolation\u201d in later years. Asher is especially vivid on the perils of teenage gangs, ably utilising such interviewees as MP David Lammy and musician and actor Ashley Walters. Asher also does a great job of delving behind male suicide statistics (the primary cause of death for men aged 20-45). With its scholarly, painstakingly thorough approach (Everyday Sexism gets a mention), you do wonder how many boys and young men will end up reading Man Up, but it could be a valuable book for parents, or anybody who works closely with children or teenagers. At the same time, Asher stresses that to care about men is not to undermine feminism: \u201cIt is precisely the interrelated nature of our existence and fortunes as men and women that motivates my analysis of the male world.\u201d I was left feeling that the books were similar after all, if only in one key way. While Girl Up uses a variety of accessible tools (jokes, lists, illustrations) to explain feminism to young girls, Man Up employs meticulous research to examine how boys and men are faring today. Ultimately, for all their differences, both books strive to illuminate \u2013 shining torches out into the modern world. Girl Up is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (\u00a312.99).

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a case of similar titles, different subject matter, with <em>Girl Up</em> by Laura Bates (the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/laura-bates-on-everyday-sexism\">Everyday Sexism project</a>), and <em>Man Up</em>, by Rebecca Asher (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/03/shattered-rebecca-asher-motherhood-equality\"><em>Shattered: Modern Motherhood And The Illusion of Equality</em></a>). The former is primarily aimed at the youth-feminism market; the latter, while not unsympathetic to feminism, asks: \u201cWe live in a man\u2019s world, so why do so many boys and men fail to flourish?\u201d Indeed, ironically, the titles flag up the differences: while <em>Girl Up</em> is a play on \u201cman up\u201d, Asher might argue that the very phrase \u201cman up\u201d is a judgment on perceived male weakness and thus part of the problem.</p> <p>In the case of <em>Girl Up</em> (\u201cPart manifesto, part girl guide\u201d), while it is youth-oriented, Bates doesn\u2019t deliver a sanitised \u201csugar-and-spice\u201d tutorial. In the preface, actor Emma Watson observes that the book is \u201cnot for the faint-hearted\u201d, and she ain\u2019t kidding! Alternative titles included Spunk for Girls and Bend Clit Like Beckham, the inside covers feature dancing cartoon vaginas (complete with top hats and canes), and, as seems de rigueur with new-style feminist tomes, there\u2019s some impressive swearing.</p> <p>Bates knows her market \u2013 no self-respecting teenager would want to be caught dead reading something that fails to produce at least a prickle of parental dread. I experienced a couple of pearl-clutching moments myself (one section appears to take masturbating with root vegetables for granted \u2013 is Bates quite sure about this?). However, as Bates, a Cambridge graduate, is doubtless aware, it\u2019s one thing to master earthy no-frills teen-vernacular; quite another feat to get an enduring message across.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/24/laura-bates-interview-everyday-sexism\">Laura Bates interview: 'Two years ago, I didn't know what feminism meant'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the main, <em>Girl Up</em> proves effective at communicating a central idea that is at once very simple and incredibly complicated: far from being weak, fluffy creatures, young women are strong and powerful. \u201cSuperheroes!\u201d declares Bates, going on to detail the forces aligned against them. Everything from societal judgments, double standards, social media pitfalls and street harassment to sexual objectification, pornography, partner abuse, food disorders and body shaming \u2013 citing and interviewing female role models along the way (from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/23/mary-beard-the-role-of-the-academic-is-to-make-everything-less-simple\">Mary Beard</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/mar/29/martha-lane-fox-profile\">Martha Lane Fox</a>, to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/28/shami-chakrabarti-people-dont-have-to-like-me-im-not-trying-to-be-a-pop-star\">Shami Chakrabarti</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/nov/09/bridget-christie-men-dads-age-2013-edinburgh-comedy-feminism-fgm\">Bridget Christie</a>).</p> <p>Some of Bates\u2019s positions may prove too hardline for some readers \u2013 such as the matter of sexual consent.

Request stops that is, now known as Paul Merton\u2019s Secret Stations (Channel 4, Sunday). He \u2013 Paul Merton \u2013 is stopping off at a few, after telling the ticket collector, because that\u2019s what you have to do in order to alight. To board, you stick your hand out as the train approaches. Like a bus, although it\u2019s more satisfying to stop a train, I imagine. That seems to be a good part of the attraction for Paul, stopping a train with his hand. That and an interest in the out of the ordinary, and the out of the way. I don\u2019t generally have much time for the celebrity travelogue, as a genre. Comedian gets on train and discovers there\u2019s a world outside the capital. But I do have plenty of time for Paul Merton, and for the out of the way, and the absurd ... well, an hour at least. [Sticks hand out, too.] First (request) stop then: Attadale, on the Kyle of Lochalsh line in the Highlands, where Paul is met by Joanna and Alec, who have moved here from Peckham. The station is pretty much their own private one \u2013 it\u2019s at the gate of their estate. Estate has a different meaning here from in Peckham \u2013 30,000 acres of gorgeousness overlooking Loch Carron, where you\u2019re more likely to get shanked by a stag\u2019s antlers than by anything more sinister. Attadale did once have its own drug dealer, though, having been owned in the 19th century by a man who made his money trafficking opium (\u201cYou haven\u2019t got any left have you?\u201d asks Paul). Joanna and Alec have an eight-bedroom pile, salmon river, all that, and you could probably buy the lot for about the same as a one-bedroom former housing association flat in SE15. But still, they say that the good thing about having the station there is that they can leave at just before six one evening and be in London by half-past seven the next morning. Attadale\u2019s head of fish, Bob Kindness, kindly takes Paul off for \u201ca bit of stripping\u201d. What?! No, not like that, stripping as in giving hand relief to salmon. So, that\u2019s OK then. Paul, wearing latex surgical gloves, reluctantly and inexpertly tosses off a cock salmon, who looks as if he\u2019s also getting no pleasure from it all. It\u2019s necessary to keep the numbers up, apparently; the salmon semen is mixed with salmon eggs to make baby salmon \u2013 salmon IVF, although it\u2019s done not in vitro but in a plastic bowl. There are more rubber gloves at the next request stop, Drigg in Cumbria. Eight, in total, just for Paul \u2013 four on each hand. Because this is home to the Low Level Waste Repository, where nuclear waste is stored. How many pairs of gloves do they wear for the high-level waste, one stop down the line at Sellafield, I wonder? As well as the gloves, Paul is put in a plastic suit and inflated, mainly for the purpose of comedy, I think. Up the line at Silecroft, Paul takes to the fells with some local runners. At Ferryside in Carmarthenshire, he meets Mr Request Stop (who has written a book about them). At St Keyne Wishing Well, he drinks the magic water that will give him authority in his relationship. [Makes note, books day-return.] That\u2019s how it goes, Paul pootling around, stopping off (after a word with the ticket collector, of course), then raising a sardonic eyebrow at what he sees there, before enthusiastically sticking out a hand for the next train through. Quite gentle then, but rather nice. I may even join him again next weekend. *** A little more scholarly is The Silk Road (BBC4, Sunday). It was basically the internet of its day, a superhighway along which not just posh cloth, paper, gunpowder, rhubarb etc was traded, but also information, philosophies, ideas. And it all began because the emperor wanted bigger horses. Now, historian Sam Willis is retracing the ancient route, armed with a Polaroid camera, a sketchbook, a big toothy smile and a nice turn of phrase. \u201cIt looks like human hair,\u201d he says of the newly spun silk at the factory. \u201cAs though a million Rapunzels have just donated.\u201d I had no idea that the manufacture of silk involved the boiling alive of millions of poor caterpillars who will never get the chance to complete their own little journeys, grow wings and fly. Still quite sexy though, isn\u2019t it?",

Judging by early reaction to the episode not everyone is happy with that plot twist after weeks of (fairly unconvincing) denials from cast and crew, but I\u2019m actually OK with Jon being brought back to life by Melisandre. Firstly, he might be a bit morose but he\u2019s also one of the few characters acting for largely honourable purposes and in a week when this show fed a woman and her newborn baby to the dogs we all need something to cling on to. Secondly, his resurrection didn\u2019t come out of nowhere: there\u2019s precedent for it thanks to the season three plot line with Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr. It\u2019s also worth noting that when Thoros told Melisandre about bringing Beric back to life he stated he had said the words in desperation, adding \u201cI have no power. I ask the Lord for His favour, and He responds as He will.\u201d Similarly, for all Davos\u2019s (rather touching) faith in her witchy abilities, Melisandre\u2019s ceremony wasn\u2019t truly working until the moment she said \u201cplease\u201d. There\u2019s also the question about those old resurrection dues \u2013 bargains with deities, no matter how heartfelt, always come with a price. Back in season three Beric told Arya: \u201cEvery time I come back \u2026 I\u2019m a bit less. Pieces of you get chipped away,\u201d and I think it would be a mistake to think Jon Snow Reborn will be the same man he was before. \u2018I prefer being an only child\u2019 The return of Jon Snow aside, I\u2019m still in two minds about both this episode and this season so far. This was a week packed full of shocking moments, unexpected deaths and the sense the very last of the old guard were falling and a new game coming into play but at the same time some questionable plotting decisions are being made. Last week it was the move to kill off Doran Martell in favour of irritating girl band manqu\u00e9 the Sand Snakes; this week it was the removal of Roose Bolton by his son Ramsay. I don\u2019t doubt Ramsay was both astute enough and panicky enough to kill his father the minute he learnt there was a new heir but it\u2019s also the case that I don\u2019t find the character as fascinating as David Benioff and DB Weiss clearly do. In fact I couldn\u2019t help wishing the confrontation had played out the other way round: I\u2019ve always preferred the cold calculation of Roose, a man who, like Tywin Lannister, made cruel decisions for entirely pragmatic and thus far more scary reasons to the more crude psychopathy of a Joffrey or a Ramsay. Roose had a sense of purpose, however wrong, when he plotted against people \u2013 Ramsay is just a monster. There\u2019s nothing particularly interesting about that and nowhere particularly interesting for the character to go. As to the scene with Walda \u2013 again it was absolutely in character that Ramsay would feed his stepmother and her child to the dogs but I didn\u2019t really feel I gained much from seeing him spell it out. I should probably just be grateful that they chose not to show the actual moment she and her baby were torn to bits. \u2018I am the storm, brother, the first storm and the last, and you\u2019re in my way\u2019 Thank goodness then for Pilou Asbaek\u2019s Euron Greyjoy who rocked up on a suitably dark and stormy night (and I do love how the weather conditions in Pyke are always wet, overcast and miserable, it makes me feel quite at home) to dispatch his older brother Balon to a watery grave while uttering gnomic phrases with appropriate menace. Clearly Euron is pitching to be this season\u2019s Oberyn Martell: a charismatic scene-stealer with a pithy turn of phrase and a hidden agenda. What are his true intentions beyond winning the Kingsmoot? Can Yara defeat him or will her ambition flounder on the hard rocks of Iron Island patriarchy? What about Theon \u2013 I can\u2019t help feeling the youngest Greyjoy may find himself hugely regretting that touching decision to head for home. One thing is certain, however: after two brief scenes I care more about the upcoming events on Pyke Island than I managed in an entire season in Dorne. Additional thoughts Welcome back, Bran. I\u2019m enjoying your Max von Sydow-guided vision quest \u2013 it\u2019s a clever way of filling the audience in on the back-story and there was a lovely wistfulness to visions of Winterfell past. Plus Hodor, or should I say Willis, got to speak. Hurrah. Anyone else think that the (I presume) children of the forest had more than a whiff of Narnia about them? I\u2019m sure some enterprising salesman is making: \u201cThat\u2019s what I do. I drink and I know things\u201d T-shirts as we speak. They\u2019re also probably knocking up Bernie Sanders/High Sparrow shirts with the words: \u201cEvery one of us is poor and powerless and yet together we can overthrow an empire\u201d emblazoned on them. If not, they should be \u2013 the revolution will be commercialised. I\u2019m not sure what it says about Game of Thrones that we\u2019re essentially rooting for the corrupt, decadent aristocrats to see off the struggling poor but I liked Jaime\u2019s scene with the High Sparrow. There\u2019s always been an interesting fatalism about Jaime, a sense that he\u2019s half in love with death, and this was a nice little reminder of that. Poor old Tommen, he\u2019s trying hard but his chances of making it through the season are looking increasingly dim. At least the question about where Trystane died was answered: in the boat in the harbour of King\u2019s Landing meaning the sand snakes must have snuck onboard. The scene with Tyrion and the dragons was nicely done \u2013 and no doubt caused a thousand \u201cTyrion is Targaryen\u201d theories to spark back into life. I also liked the little moment between Brienne and Sansa when they discussed Arya. I\u2019m really rooting for these two (and Pod), which means sadly they\u2019re all doomed. Talking of Arya, hopefully this means the Jedi training is now, finally, going to move on. I thought Carice van Houten was particularly good this week. It\u2019s interesting to see Melisandre\u2019s vulnerability to the fore. Finally, I\u2019m not really convinced by Yara\u2019s ability. She has a tendency to make these fantastically overblown statements of intent \u2013 I\u2019m going to bring my brother home, I\u2019m going to avenge my father\u2019s death, I\u2019m going to rule the ironborn \u2013 but something of a problem with the followthrough. Violence count A particularly violent episode saw several killed at Castle Black, one drunken boaster get his head smashed in by Ser Gregorstein, another beating for Arya, the murder of Roose Bolton and the subsequent tearing to death of his wife and newborn child, and the end of Balon Greyjoy, who learnt exactly why it\u2019s never a good idea to attempt to challenge a mysterious stranger on a swaying bridge in the dark. Random Irishman of the week So farewell then Michael McElhatton aka Roose Bolton. You were my favourite villain and your softly spoken but highly devious plotting will be much missed. So what did you think? Were you shocked by Jon\u2019s revival? What about Roose\u2019s death? Does Tyrion have a plan beyond free the dragons? And did the arrival of Euron Greyjoy make you interested in what\u2019s happening in Pyke? As ever, all speculation and no spoilers are welcome below \u2026",

      "bodyText": "We all know what wearing leopard print means. It means you are sexy and womanly and a bit daring but very much within socially acceptable boundaries. It means being rock\u2019n\u2019roll up to, but not beyond, the two-martinis-on-a-schoolnight watermark. You put on your leopard-print pencil skirt and you\u2019re, like, mentally high-fiving Diane von F\u00fcrstenberg as you leave for the office. But what does gingham mean? This is a matter of some urgency, because gingham is owning spring 2016. Gigi Hadid wears a red-and-white gingham high waisted bikini in American Vogue this month, and wore a black-and-white gingham one-piece swimsuit on her birthday. Poppy Delevingne has designed a black-and-white gingham sundress for cult label Solid and Striped. Prince George\u2019s pyjamas \u2013 which, lets face it, have been this season\u2019s top-scoring outfit so far \u2013 were blue gingham, while his mum wore a gingham dress by bespoke London label Eponine last month. Days later, President Obama wore a gingham shirt for the White House Easter egg roll. Caitlyn Jenner has been wearing a gingham shirt with denim cut-offs; on the J Crew site this month, creative director Jenna Lyons has posted a \u201cgingham diary\u201d with five different looks. (Our favourite: shopping for peonies at a photogenic West Village apothecary while rocking a belted pink gingham blazer #goals.) Gingham is wholesomeness. It is family-album seaside holiday snaps, school uniforms, homestyle bistro tablecloths. In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy\u2019s gingham dress embodies the message of the film: there\u2019s no place like home. I blame this year\u2019s gingham revival at least in part on Taylor Swift, and the Taylor Swiftification of pop culture. Gingham is perfect for Swift\u2019s homebody, cat-loving vibe, and she has worn it for years. If you were invited for brunch with Tay Tay\u2019s squad, you would totally wear gingham. (Squad members Gigi and Kendall Jenner have been at the forefront of this year\u2019s gingham thing.) Gingham is also hot. Bardot in that pink-and-white wedding dress, Monroe in gingham capri pants, Gigi in her swimsuit. It\u2019s an earthy hotness, a girl-can\u2019t-help-it sex appeal rather than the strategic, Versace-wearing kind. (Caveat: this only works on women. On men, gingham isn\u2019t sexy at all, just wholesome. Why is this? Wholesomeness and innocence is appealing in women but not in men?) And it is particularly hot right now. \u201cGingham is moving away from the Stepford wives connotations,\u201d says Harvey Nichols fashion buying director Anita Barr. \u201cIt works particularly well for summer, playing on the French Riviera traditions of the 1950s. A grown-up, contemporary variation was seen at Stella McCartney, who plays with an asymmetric print in bold primary colours. Or if you\u2019re looking for a subtle nod to the trend, Alexander McQueen\u2019s woven leather stiletto heels, toe-capped using a gingham print, add an edgier ladylike look.\u201d \u201cGingham says attitude: sweet, sassy, a bit geeky,\u201d say the Warehouse design team, who have come up with an early summer hit with their monochrome gingham off-the-shoulder dress, (\u00a349). What does it all mean? Well, for a start, it means you should buy the dress.",

This is a matter of some urgency, because gingham is owning spring 2016. Gigi Hadid wears a red-and-white gingham <a href=\"http://www.vogue.com/slideshow/13422014/gigi-hadid-zayn-malik-italy-vacation/#3\">high waisted bikini </a>in American Vogue this month, and wore a black-and-white gingham one-piece swimsuit on her birthday. Poppy Delevingne has designed a black-and-white gingham sundress for cult label Solid and Striped. Prince George\u2019s pyjamas \u2013 which, lets face it, have been this season\u2019s top-scoring outfit so far \u2013 were blue gingham, while his mum wore a gingham dress by <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/03/kate-middleton-eponine-checkered-gingham-dress\">bespoke London label Eponine</a> last month. Days later, President Obama wore a gingham shirt for the White House Easter egg roll. Caitlyn Jenner has been wearing a gingham shirt with denim cut-offs; on the J Crew site this month, creative director Jenna Lyons has posted a \u201cgingham diary\u201d with five different looks. (Our favourite: shopping for peonies at a photogenic West Village apothecary while rocking a belted<a href=\"https://hello.jcrew.com/2016-05-may/the-challenge-gingham?srccode=TBLR00664\"> pink gingham blazer</a> #goals.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"45acfe4e2c922b0330e287b1138398c297a4d1e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45acfe4e2c922b0330e287b1138398c297a4d1e3/0_0_2314_1543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama wears a gingham shirt for the White House Easter egg roll\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama wears a gingham shirt for the White House Easter egg roll.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gingham is wholesomeness. It is family-album seaside holiday snaps, school uniforms, homestyle bistro tablecloths. In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy\u2019s gingham dress embodies the message of the film: there\u2019s no place like home. I blame this year\u2019s gingham revival at least in part on Taylor Swift, and the Taylor Swiftification of pop culture. Gingham is perfect for Swift\u2019s homebody, cat-loving vibe, and she has worn it for years. If you were invited for brunch with Tay Tay\u2019s squad, you would totally wear gingham. (Squad members Gigi and Kendall Jenner have been at the forefront of this year\u2019s gingham thing.)</p> <p>Gingham is also hot. Bardot in that <a href=\"http://www.vogue.com/slideshow/13265484/brigitte-bardot-weddings/,\">pink-and-white wedding dress</a>, Monroe in gingham capri pants, Gigi in her swimsuit. It\u2019s an earthy hotness, a girl-can\u2019t-help-it sex appeal rather than the strategic, Versace-wearing kind. (Caveat: this only works on women. On men, gingham isn\u2019t sexy at all, just wholesome. Why is this? Wholesomeness and innocence is appealing in women but not in men?)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97f56a65201ba0cc3a8946942610f1783f1d0eaa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97f56a65201ba0cc3a8946942610f1783f1d0eaa/0_0_4275_3224/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marilyn Monroe in gingham capri pants\" width=\"1000\" height=\"754\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marilyn Monroe in gingham capri pants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alfred Eisenstaedt/The Life Picture Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2fcc2fa30cdd6104b1e4a0ba6c70e377873140f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fcc2fa30cdd6104b1e4a0ba6c70e377873140f0/0_0_1500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Warehouse off-the-shoulder gingham dress\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warehouse off-the-shoulder gingham dress</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it is particularly hot right now. \u201cGingham is moving away from the Stepford wives connotations,\u201d says Harvey Nichols fashion buying director Anita Barr. \u201cIt works particularly well for summer, playing on the French Riviera traditions of the 1950s. A grown-up, contemporary variation was seen at Stella McCartney, who plays with an asymmetric print in<a href=\"http://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/spring-summer-2016/ready-to-wear/stella-mccartney/close-up-photos/gallery/1498014\"> bold primary colours</a>.

      "bodyText": "Hayley Miller was initially shocked when she received a letter to say the rent on her London flat was to increase by \u00a31,000 a month. But this soon turned to resignation when she accepted that the unaffordable hike would mean she had to move to another flat \u2013 her eighth move in eight years. \u201cThe contract was coming up for renewal and we were told the rent was increasing to \u00a32,800 a month [from \u00a31,800],\u201d says the 34-year-old, who shares a two-bedroom flat in Camden with a couple. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad as I loved it, and the landlord let us get two cats only a few months ago. I\u2019ve only been there around a year, and the last rise was only about \u00a370, so this was a total shock.\u201d Miller\u2019s frustration at the price of renting is common, and has led to calls for the introduction of European-style rent controls whereby caps are put on how much landlords can raise prices. In her case there was no explanation for the increase. Although the tenants disputed it and got the price reduced by 15%, it still remained too much and she will have to move. \u201cMy friends are facing similar situations,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes sense that rents rise in line with inflation \u2013 but more should be done to stop insane rises.\u201d She is not alone in her wish for stiffer regulations. According to a poll conducted by Spareroom.com, 65% of renters support some form of controls. Dan Wilson Craw from Generation Rent, a group which campaigns for professionally managed homes, says: \u201cWe need rent control not for the sake of it, but because the housing market is broken. Demand for housing should encourage greater supply, and result in rents that are affordable \u2013 but that isn\u2019t happening.\u201d Laws in other European countries have put the brakes on soaring rents. Since June 2015, landlords in Berlin have been prevented from raising rents for new tenants to more than 10% above the local average. The aim is to keep the city affordable, with the model being copied in Hamburg and hundreds of other towns and cities around the country. \u201cEngland has regulations in place, but they are incredibly weak and ineffective,\u201d says John Bibby, a policy officer at housing charity Shelter. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for landlords to impose excessive rent increases, with tenants able to choose between paying up, or moving out.\u201d Labour pledged to introduce rent controls in its 2015 election manifesto. Former leader Ed Miliband said rises should be limited to inflation over a three-year period, and tenancy lengths of three years should become the norm. A report from the London Assembly\u2019s housing committee in March produced strong reactions, but politicians failed to reach agreement on what various measures \u2013 such as capping rises and providing longer tenancies \u2013 would achieve. There are pitfalls to hardline caps, according to commentators. \u201cRent caps are the most onerous of regulations,\u201d says Bibby. \u201cConcerns include landlords withdrawing from the market, and this could trigger evictions.\u201d Property analyst Kate Faulkner says rent controls may actually penalise some tenants. \u201cThe biggest problem is they haven\u2019t been proven to work anywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cIt risks landlords selling up, and doesn\u2019t tackle the main problem \u2013 a lack of stock.\u201d She says landlords often have an interest in keeping good tenants and rents fixed. \u201cContractually, landlords may be more likely to put rents up in line with whatever the cap allows \u2013 penalising the very people they are designed to protect.\u201d Germany is often held up as the model of stabilisation, with many people living in the same property for life. Kath Scanlon, a researcher at the London School of Economics, authored a 2011 report entitled Towards a sustainable private rented sector, and said it would be difficult to replicate the system in the UK. \u201cThe Berlin system requires a sophisticated database of private sector rents, and that\u2019s an area where statistics in this country are very poor. Imposing rent caps would be perceived by landlords as the final nail in the coffin after the reduction in mortgage interest rate relief and the new stamp duty surcharge,\u201d she says. In Scotland a private tenancies bill was passed in March. This will introduce powers for local authorities to implement rent controls, and is expected to come into force over the next parliament. Rent increases will be limited to the CPI measure of inflation plus 1%, with additional allowances where improvements have been made to the property. Shelter, meanwhile, is calling for landlords to be barred from raising rents above inflation, and establishing longer five-year tenancies. \u201cBoth have to be done at the same time to work effectively, and prevent landlords simply evicting people as a way to put rent up by more than inflation,\u201d Bibby says. \u201cThis is how much of the rest of Europe organises its rent regulation \u2013 England is an outlier.\u201d The campaign for a fair rents will continue. Meanwhile, the landscape is changing dramatically. Experts at accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers predict that by 2025, 7.2 million households will be in rental accommodation, compared with 5.4 million today and just 2.3 million in 2001. \u201cIt\u2019s about time the system is made fit for purpose,\u201d says Bibby. \u201cPrivate renting is no longer just a stepping stone for young adults \u2013 it\u2019s where a quarter of families in England have to live.\u201d Despite the support for intervention, political parties have been reluctant to introduce controls. The likelihood of any being put in place under the current government is slim, say experts. \u201cI believe the government would argue that the introduction of controls would choke supply \u2013 big changes are a long way from happening,\u201d says Scanlon. John Dickie, a 48-year-old civil servant, found out at Easter that the rent on his Bermondsey studio flat will go up by 38% from November. He currently pays \u00a3765 a month and is not able to afford the increase to \u00a31,050, forcing him to move outside of London having lived in the same place for the past nine years. He says rent stabilisation to prevent such increases would be a welcome development. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to look for somewhere cheaper, so realistically \u2013 I am single and haven\u2019t had a pay rise worth the name in a few years \u2013 I am either going to be looking at moving outside London, and then having to factor in travel costs, because at the moment I walk to and from work; or I\u2019m going to have to look at sharing,\u201d he says. WHAT RENTERS SAY Londoners have been sharing their renting nightmares on social media in an attempt to highlight the issue during the mayoral elections, writes Shane Hickey. Under the #ventyourrent hashtag on Twitter, people have been revealing exactly what you get for your money in the capital. \u201c\u00a3750. Double room in Hackney. Landlord was a total bully! He would enter property without notice. He did not even bother knocking! Took me four months to get deposit back!\u201d said one. \u201cRent: \u00a3700. Location: Wapping. Landlord continues to refuse to treat mould-infested flat. I\u2019d move but I can\u2019t afford to (Also, the landlord insists we pay our rent in cash),\u201d reported another. The campaign was launched by Generation Rent in the run up to the mayoral election, which takes place on Thursday. Among the complaints were pictures of mould growing (titled \u201cFancy Decoration\u201d) and a picture of a beetle (\u201cPets included. Leyton \u00a3780\u201d). Another wrote: \u201cWalthamstow. \u00a31,150 (one-bedroom flat). Leaky mouldy sink, saggy curtain rail, people openly piss in the street.\u201d Generation Rent said renters should make their complaints heard via the ballot box this week. \u201cThe candidates for mayor describe London as the greatest city on earth, but as long as growing numbers are paying huge sums to live in squalor they\u2019ll have a lot of work to do to make that a reality. The hashtag #ventyourrent is unearthing the scale of common problems like damp and mice, all the way up to the most shocking experiences like poisoning, ceilings falling in and bullying landlords and letting agents,\u201d said policy manager Dan Wilson Craw. CONTROLS ACROSS EUROPE Most European countries have longer tenancies than the UK and give renters some degree of certainty about how much rents will rise during their lease, writes Shane Hickey. \u25a0 Germany Around 50% of householders rent privately, with standard leases offered over a lifetime. \u201cYou can live in the property until you die,\u201d says Kath Scanlon, a researcher at the London School of Economics. This compares to normal tenancy agreements lasting just six-12 months in the UK, with either the landlord or tenant able to terminate a contract after that period.\u201cAs a tenant in Germany you make a big investment,\u201d says Scanlon. \u201cIt\u2019s common for properties to come with far fewer facilities than in the UK \u2013 often, they don\u2019t have a kitchen, so you have to install your own.\u201d Before rent caps were enforced, landlords were able to set initial rents at whatever they wanted. Caps were put in place to protect new tenants and to respond to concerns about rents rising too fast amid a housing shortage. But the new system has attracted criticism from tenants\u2019 rights groups who say the burden of enforcement relies on renters, and rogue landlords aren\u2019t penalised for busting the cap. \u25a0 Sweden Rents are set through negotiations between representatives of landlords and tenants. In 2014, the rent rise for Stockholm was set at 1.12%. However, the system has experienced pressures, with a shortage of properties creating a thriving rental property black market. \u25a0 Holland The rent charged depends on the number of \u201cquality points\u201d houses rack up. \u201cThis depends on attributes including size, whether they have a garden and double-glazing \u2013 but not location,\u201d says Scanlon. \u201cThere is a maximum that can be charged depending on this, although at the top end \u2013 for properties with rents above \u20ac700 a month \u2013 they can be freely set.\u201d \u25a0 Denmark There are two control systems. \u201cThey depend on when the property was built \u2013 but both hold rents below market levels,\u201d Scanlon says. Properties built since 1991 are free of rent controls. \u201cThis was to encourage more properties to be built \u2013 but it hasn\u2019t worked.\u201d \u25a0 France A controversial set of controls came into force in Paris in August last year. Rents must be no more than 20% above or 30% below the median rental price for the area. The rules prompted anger among property agencies and landlords, who claimed they would deter investment.",

Imposing rent caps would be perceived by landlords as the final nail in the coffin after the reduction in mortgage interest rate relief and the new stamp duty surcharge,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In Scotland a private tenancies bill was passed in March. This will introduce powers for local authorities to implement rent controls, and is expected to come into force over the next parliament. Rent increases will be limited to the CPI measure of inflation plus 1%, with additional allowances where improvements have been made to the property.</p> <p>Shelter, meanwhile, is calling for landlords to be barred from raising rents above inflation, and establishing longer five-year tenancies. \u201cBoth have to be done at the same time to work effectively, and prevent landlords simply evicting people as a way to put rent up by more than inflation,\u201d Bibby says. \u201cThis is how much of the rest of Europe organises its rent regulation \u2013 England is an outlier.\u201d</p> <p>The campaign for a fair rents will continue. Meanwhile, the landscape is changing dramatically. Experts at accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers predict that by 2025, 7.2 million households will be in rental accommodation, compared with 5.4 million today and just 2.3 million in 2001.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time the system is made fit for purpose,\u201d says Bibby. \u201cPrivate renting is no longer just a stepping stone for young adults \u2013 it\u2019s where a quarter of families in England have to live.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the support for intervention, political parties have been reluctant to introduce controls. The likelihood of any being put in place under the current government is slim, say experts. \u201cI believe the government would argue that the introduction of controls would choke supply \u2013 big changes are a long way from happening,\u201d says Scanlon.</p> <p>John Dickie, a 48-year-old civil servant, found out at Easter that the rent on his Bermondsey studio flat will go up by 38% from November. He currently pays \u00a3765 a month and is not able to afford the increase to \u00a31,050, forcing him to move outside of London having lived in the same place for the past nine years.</p> <p>He says rent stabilisation to prevent such increases would be a welcome development. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to look for somewhere cheaper, so realistically \u2013 I am single and haven\u2019t had a pay rise worth the name in a few years \u2013 I am either going to be looking at moving outside London, and then having to factor in travel costs, because at the moment I walk to and from work; or I\u2019m going to have to look at sharing,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>WHAT RENTERS SAY</h2> <p>Londoners have been sharing their renting nightmares on social media in an attempt to highlight the issue during the mayoral elections, <em>writes Shane Hickey</em>. Under the #ventyourrent hashtag on Twitter, people have been revealing exactly what you get for your money in the capital.</p> <p>\u201c\u00a3750. Double room in Hackney. Landlord was a total bully! He would enter property without notice. He did not even bother knocking! Took me four months to get deposit back!\u201d said one.</p> <p>\u201cRent: \u00a3700. Location: Wapping. Landlord continues to refuse to treat mould-infested flat. I\u2019d move but I can\u2019t afford to (Also, the landlord insists we pay our rent in cash),\u201d reported another.</p> <p>The campaign was launched by Generation Rent in the run up to the mayoral election, which takes place on Thursday. Among the complaints were pictures of mould growing (titled \u201cFancy Decoration\u201d) and a picture of a beetle (\u201cPets included. Leyton \u00a3780\u201d). Another wrote: \u201cWalthamstow. \u00a31,150 (one-bedroom flat). Leaky mouldy sink, saggy curtain rail, people openly piss in the street.\u201d</p> <p>Generation Rent said renters should make their complaints heard via the ballot box this week. \u201cThe candidates for mayor describe London as the greatest city on earth, but as long as growing numbers are paying huge sums to live in squalor they\u2019ll have a lot of work to do to make that a reality. The hashtag #ventyourrent is unearthing the scale of common problems like damp and mice, all the way up to the most shocking experiences like poisoning, ceilings falling in and bullying landlords and letting agents,\u201d said policy manager Dan Wilson Craw.</p> <h2>CONTROLS ACROSS EUROPE</h2> <p>Most European countries have longer tenancies than the UK and give renters some degree of certainty about how much rents will rise during their lease, <em>writes Shane Hickey</em>.</p> <p>\u25a0 <strong>Germany</strong> Around 50% of householders rent privately, with standard leases offered over a lifetime. \u201cYou can live in the property until you die,\u201d says Kath Scanlon, a researcher at the London School of Economics. This compares to normal tenancy agreements lasting just six-12 months in the UK, with either the landlord or tenant able to terminate a contract after that period.\u201cAs a tenant in Germany you make a big investment,\u201d says Scanlon. \u201cIt\u2019s common for properties to come with far fewer facilities than in the UK \u2013 often, they don\u2019t have a kitchen, so you have to install your own.\u201d</p> <p>Before rent caps were enforced, landlords were able to set initial rents at whatever they wanted. Caps were put in place to protect new tenants and to respond to concerns about rents rising too fast amid a housing shortage.</p> <p>But the new system has attracted criticism from tenants\u2019 rights groups who say the burden of enforcement relies on renters, and rogue landlords aren\u2019t penalised for busting the cap.</p> <p>\u25a0 <strong>Sweden </strong>Rents are set through negotiations between representatives of landlords and tenants. In 2014, the rent rise for Stockholm was set at 1.12%. However, the system has experienced pressures, with a shortage of properties creating a thriving rental property black market.</p> <p>\u25a0 <strong>Holland </strong>The rent charged depends on the number of \u201cquality points\u201d houses rack up. \u201cThis depends on attributes including size, whether they have a garden and double-glazing \u2013 but not location,\u201d says Scanlon. \u201cThere is a maximum that can be charged depending on this, although at the top end \u2013 for properties with rents above \u20ac700 a month \u2013 they can be freely set.\u201d</p> <p>\u25a0 <strong>Denmark </strong>There are two control systems. \u201cThey depend on when the property was built \u2013 but both hold rents below market levels,\u201d Scanlon says. Properties built since 1991 are free of rent controls. \u201cThis was to encourage more properties to be built \u2013 but it hasn\u2019t worked.\u201d</p> <p>\u25a0 <strong>France </strong>A controversial set of controls came into force in Paris in August last year. Rents must be no more than 20% above or 30% below the median rental price for the area. The rules prompted anger among property agencies and landlords, who claimed they would deter investment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "What was the last piece of music you bought? The new album by And\u00e9 Somby, Yoiking With the Winged Ones. He\u2019s appearing at Tectonics in Glasgow and Oslo this year. What\u2019s your musical guilty pleasure? Sometimes I like listening to disco, or New Wave stuff such as Roxy Music. But I listen to so much music I don\u2019t really feel that anything is a guilty pleasure. How do you listen to music most often? CDs in the car, vinyl records at home, and on my headphones when travelling. But family life means I don\u2019t listen as much at home any more. What was the first record or CD you bought? When I was 13 and I lived in Munich there was a great CD store off Marianneplatz, and they\u2019d let you listen to anything. I first heard Tristan and Wozzeck there, which my parents then bought for me. The first thing I bought with my own money though was Bach Sonatas &amp; Partitas for solo violin. Is applauding between movements acceptable? Sure. It happens more and more but I don\u2019t find it a problem. Mozart used to write to his father telling him about the applause he\u2019d get in the middle of a symphony. It\u2019s always been part of the response between the audience and the musicians. Mobile phones are more of a problem for me than an audience voicing its excitement. What single thing would improve the format of the classical concert? I\u2019m kind of traditional, but one thing that I do hate is when there\u2019s too much light on the audience and they want to read the programme notes. If people want to read about the music they can do it before the concert, after it, or at the break, but they should be listening during the performance. I like it quite dark in the hall, like a theatre. What\u2019s been your most memorable live music experience as an audience member? I remember going to seeing Christa Ludwig doing Winterreise in New York. I was 13 and didn\u2019t know the piece well - it was the first time I\u2019d heard it all the way through. It was at Carnegie Hall with James Levine at the piano. It was just amazing. We\u2019re giving you a time machine: what period, or moment in musical history, would you travel to and why? The premiere of Monteverdi\u2019s Orfeo. The initial beginning of opera is so far from us, it\u2019s so unknown. There are so few documents about it, no pictures, nothing. To be there and discover what it was like would be incredible. If you found yourself with six months free to learn a new instrument, what would you choose? Percussion. Perhaps Indian drumming. Do you enjoy musicals? Do you have a favourite? No, it\u2019s so loud with the PA and I don\u2019t like those amplified voices. I\u2019m more into Kurt Weill, which is where musicals came from; those witty, powerful texts, and that distilled music which is both simple and complex. I\u2019m doing the Seven Deadly Sins later in the year with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. Which conductor or performer of yester-year do you most wish you could have worked with? Artur Schnabel. For me his Beethoven Piano Sonatas are just unequalled, they\u2019re really vibrant and free. He\u2019s using tempo in an interesting way, there\u2019s lots of rubato and this strong feeling of structure. Doing a Beethoven or Brahms piano concerto with him would have been incredible. What, in your opinion, is the most overrated classical piece? I used to avoid doing Shostakovich Five as I thought it was overrated \u2013 and then I did it and just loved it! It\u2019s not the same, but in a funny way I think Mahler is being played too much. I love his work but it\u2019s over-programmed. Which non-classical musician would you love to work with? Diamanda Gallas or Brian Wilson. Imagine you\u2019re a festival director here in London with unlimited resources. What would you programme - or commission - for your opening event? I\u2019m kind of doing that with the Tectonics festivals around the world \u2013 but not with unlimited resources! I\u2019d love to do a new large-scale opera or a vocal piece that blends lots of genres, such as folk music, improvised and electronic music, and which uses a brand new text. Something that would also use multi-media, professional and non-professional artists so that it\u2019s community based as well. And to be staged somewhere that makes an innovative use of space. It\u2019s late, you\u2019ve had a few beers, you\u2019re in a Karaoke bar. What do you choose to sing? Probably some Israeli songs from the 80s. Something like Svika Pick. Tectonics festival, curated by Ilan Volkov, is at City Halls, Glasgow on 7 and 8 May.",

      "bodyText": "This is a tough time to be a graduate in Mali. The uprising and military coup of 2012, together with ongoing attacks, mean tourists and foreign investors are nervous. Unless you\u2019re an interpreter for the UN \u2013 which has more than 10,000 troops in the north \u2013 or work in the security industry, job prospects look bleak. In a country where young job seekers aged from 15 to 39 make up about 80% of all unemployed people, one school seems to be bucking the trend. Perhaps surprisingly, it teaches art, theatre, dance and music. \u201cAround 60% of our students get jobs when they graduate,\u201d says Abdoulaye Konat\u00e9, the director and founder of the renowned Balla Fass\u00e9k\u00e9 Kouyat\u00e9 Conservatory, known as Camm or the Conservatoire. Konat\u00e9 is one of Mali\u2019s most famous contemporary artists. He uses traditional materials and techniques in his textile-based work, which has been featured in exhibitions in London\u2019s Hayward Gallery, Washington\u2019s Smithsonian National Museum of African Art and the Pompidou Centre in Paris. At his studio in Bamako, around the corner from the Radisson Blu hotel that was the scene of a terrorist attack last November, Konat\u00e9 displays some of his large textiles. They arrive neatly folded, like quilts, and are spread out on the floor. The first shows the outline of a man holding his detached cranium, which is overrunning with blood. The work is called Immigration and the message is clear: when native talent leaves countries, it has devastating consequences. Migration has always been a part of life in Mali but it has achieved a new level of international visibility now, according to Isaie Dougnon, an assistant professor at the University of Bamako who specialises in migration. \u201cIt\u2019s hit the news as Europe has put up legal and physical barriers,\u201d he says, noting that young people were also leaving for central Africa, including Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. Konat\u00e9 founded Camm in 2004. At first a personal project, it is now funded by the government, through the ministry of culture. For Konat\u00e9 binding people to their homeland is part of its mission. He was among 70 African artists featured in Simon Njami\u2019s 2005 Africa Remix show in London. He\u2019s showing work at the Eva International, Ireland\u2019s biennial of contemporary art, and has a retrospective at the Arken Museum of Modern Art in Denmark this year. Konat\u00e9 explains that there are three strands to the school\u2019s curriculum. The first is academic: students learn the basic principles of art, such as proportion, anatomy, technique and the canon. The second strand aims to instil a profound knowledge of \u2013 and pride in \u2013 the Malian heritage. \u201cIt is important that they understand the techniques and concepts behind their own culture,\u201d Konat\u00e9 says. To emphasise this, he has insisted that teachers of traditional techniques be paid the same as those with official qualifications. The school also teaches its students digital skills, and they are planning to open a film department. Ti\u00e9coura N\u2019Daou, a former student and visual artist from Mopti in central Mali, now teaches at the Conservatoire. He was recently featured in a contemporary art festival in S\u00e3o Paulo, VideoBrasil, and is even more upbeat than Konat\u00e9 about the percentage of students who get jobs in Mali after studying at the Conservatoire. \u201cMore than 70% find work in media agencies, teaching, freelance projects \u2013 or they start up their own projects,\u201d he says. This is important economically. Migrants within Mali send back money to their families, and this improves living conditions throughout the country, according to Abdoullah Coulibaly, founder and chairman of the annual Bamako Forum \u2013 referred to by some as the Davos of Africa. He says that retaining these people in Mali helps \u201cto secure a dynamic workforce\u201d and support development more generally. An international outlook is important to Konat\u00e9, who invites teachers from France, Guinea, Niger and Ivory Coast to the school under an exchange programme known as the Voie Sacr\u00e9e, or sacred path. There are about three students to every teacher and 20 of the college\u2019s 80 teachers are from other countries. The 260 students must take a tough entrance exam, and come from all over Mali and the rest of Africa. Konat\u00e9 feels that this diversity allows students to experience different artistic techniques and current trends, and to question preconceptions. \u201cPerhaps at the end, the student will find his artistic personality,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen they leave they have skills and a portfolio. They have been taught how to think. We\u2019re not here to form artists, because that is difficult to do, but if they want to become artists, we\u2019ve given them the tools to do so.\u201d There is more at stake than jobs. As Mali recalibrates after the civil war, art and culture are key weapons in the battle for peace, reconciliation and economic sustainability. The Conservatoire\u2019s concert hall hosted the opening night of the Festival Acoustik de Bamako, the first international music festival to take place in Bamako since 2012. It was organised by the Grammy award-winning kora player Toumani Diabat\u00e9, who has taught at the school. In the courtyard, students performed traditional dances from the Mand\u00e9, Dogon, S\u00e9gou and Djenn\u00e9 regions. N\u2019Daou says this unity is important. \u201cThe Conservatoire plays an important role. The students have worked on songs and art that talk of peace and reconciliation. One of their songs, which encourages Malians to come together, has been played on national television.\u201d Konat\u00e9, who retired in December but is staying on temporarily until a replacement is found, also believes that the school, as well as training students in skills that will allow them to live and work in Mali, can help repair the societal fractures caused by recent conflicts. \u201cSolutions will not be found in occupying territories or arms sales or terrorism. People have to listen to each other, they have to discuss, and each side has to yield a little so that people can live in peace together.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hay fever season is kicking off again, and for nearly a quarter of the population, that can mean seasonal misery and debilitating symptoms. Hay fever is an allergy to airborne particles such as pollen and fungal spores that affects the nasal passages, eyes and lungs, causing sneezing, an itchy, runny or congested nose, watering and sore eyes, aching sinuses and a wheezy cough. The symptoms can interfere with sleep and make it hard to concentrate. In the UK, trees pollinate from late March to mid May, grasses from mid May to July and weeds from the end of June to September. The pollen \u201cseason\u201d is normally March to August, but it can start in January and last until November. When your symptoms start depends on whether you are allergic to tree, grass or weed pollen. Different tree species pollinate at different times and you may be much more allergic to one type of tree pollen than another. People who are highly allergic will get severe symptoms even if pollen counts are low. And even non-allergic people may experience some sneezing and itchy eyes if they spend a lot of time outdoors when pollen counts are unusually high. The Met Office provides a five-day pollen forecast that can help you take preventive action. The best approach to hay fever is to avoid the triggers \u2013 but pollen gets everywhere and it\u2019s miserable to stay indoors when the sun\u2019s shining. NHS Choices suggests you rub Vaseline just inside your nostrils to keep pollen out, and stay indoors with windows shut when the pollen count is above 50. Pollen counts are highest in early morning, evening and night, so avoid cutting the grass at those times or camping in grassy fields. Shower and change clothes after being outdoors, wear sunglasses, and keep car windows closed. Consider getting a pollen filter for airvents in the car. Any hay fever sufferer needs a kit of effective treatments. Oral antihistamines work but older ones, such as chlorphenamine (Piriton) make you sleepy. That\u2019s good if you need a comfortable night\u2019s sleep \u2013 less so if you have an exam the next day. Newer antihistamines such as cetirizine (Zirtek) are less likely to cause drowsiness. Buy the cheapest \u2013 there\u2019s an extraordinary markup for certain brands and smaller pack sizes. I found a supermarket own-brand cetirizine for 9p a pill that was identical to Zirtek sold by an online pharmacy for 41p a pill. An antihistamine nasal spray, azelastine (Rhinolast), is as effective as an oral antihistamine for nasal symptoms, but won\u2019t help your eyes, sinuses or lungs in the same way. Steroid nasal sprays such as beclometasone (Beconase) are as effective as oral antihistamines. They reduce all hay-fever symptoms if started early enough in the year because they damp down nasal inflammation and stop pollen triggering a widespread allergic response. Dymista is a newish nasal spray that combines a steroid and antihistamine. It is expensive and not approved for NHS prescription in all areas. Oral decongestants such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) can be helpful if you are very bunged up. You can take Sudafed for a few days until a steroid nasal spray starts working. Actifed is a tablet that combines an antihistamine with pseudoephedrine, but the combination may not be much more effective than antihistamines alone and the risk of side effects and interactions with other drugs is much greater. Decongestant nasal sprays such as oxymetazoline (Vicks Sinex) work faster than oral decongestants, but you cannot use them for longer than a week because you get a rebound effect and end up with worse congestion than you started with. Allergy specialist Dr Glenis Scadding says: \u201cThe new thing in hay fever is Serenz.\u201d It\u2019s a carbon dioxide nasal washout that works well as a rescue treatment when symptoms are troublesome. Holly Shaw, nurse adviser at Allergy UK, says: \u201cNatural remedies such as allergen barrier balms, and nasal saline douching are very effective add-on treatments that can be purchased over the chemist\u2019s counter.\u201d When all else has failed and you are facing an exam or your wedding day with swollen eyes, streaming nose and a head that feels like bursting, you can get oral steroids from your GP that should work a treat. It is only a short-term fix, and repeated or prolonged courses are harmful, but it will get you through the exam or down the aisle.",

      "bodyText": "Donovan, singer-songwriter Sunshine Superman was one of the first British psychedelic records, but it\u2019s primarily a love song. It was the mid-60s and I was appearing on Ready Steady Go!, playing Catch the Wind, when I saw this girl. I said to my mate Gypsy Dave: \u201cMy God, look at that girl. She\u2019s beautiful.\u201d We had a dance. She told me her name was Linda Lawrence and I was absolutely smitten. We got together for a while, but when I asked her to marry me she said no. She\u2019d just broken up with Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones. She\u2019d been the first celebrity girlfriend of the pop era and was tired of fleeing the paparazzi. She\u2019d also had a kid at 16. The police were going to take it away until her mum said she would look after it. Linda fled to Los Angeles. \u201cPlenty more fish in the sea,\u201d said Gypsy Dave. But none like Linda. I wrote Sunshine Superman knowing she\u2019d hear the lyrics and realise I still loved her. I sang: \u201cIt\u2019ll take time, I know it, but in a while / You\u2019re gonna be mine, I know it / We\u2019ll do it in style.\u201d Sunshine did come softly through my window the day I wrote it, just like in the lyrics, but \u201csunshine\u201d can also mean LSD. I\u2019d just read The Doors of Perception, Aldous Huxley\u2019s book about taking mescaline, and wanted to get to the invisible fourth dimension of transcendental superconscious vision. I tried LSD, mescaline and finally meditation. At the time, I was great pals with the Beatles. We were all experimenting, nicking sounds from each other. I was getting into baroque music and told my producer, Mickey Most, I wanted harpsichord on the track. \u201cYou need an arranger,\u201d he said, introducing me to John Cameron who understood immediately. \u201cYou want a soundtrack to your poetry,\u201d he said. \u201cLike a movie.\u201d When Mickey heard the result, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve really created something here, Don. Don\u2019t let Paul McCartney hear it.\u201d The song was a smash. Four years later, I was renting my old cottage in Hertfordshire out to two American girls. Lorey, one of them, went to a party at Eric Clapton\u2019s house with Linda, who was back from LA. To this day I don\u2019t know if Lorey was setting us up, but she told Linda: \u201cI\u2019m renting a cottage. Want to see it?\u201d I met them when they came round and Lorey said: \u201cOh, do you two know each other?\u201d We were married a few weeks later and have been together ever since. John Cameron, arranger and harpsichordist I pitched up in a flat full of purple drapes and zodiac stars and started talking to Don about the song. Then suddenly Chas Chandler of the Animals burst in, saying he\u2019d found this fantastic guitarist in New York called Jimi Hendrix. And then we just resumed our meeting. Don was up for anything: he didn\u2019t want the classic rock sound, but something different, something jazzier. So we used classic jazzers: Spike Heatley on double bass, John Paul Jones on bass guitar. Then Mickey added the guitar \u2013 played by Jimmy Page. Mickey was a great producer. He\u2019d go \u201cI like that bit\u201d or \u201cTake that bit out\u201d. He once told me to set out an an arrangement on Velcro. My harpsichord was an enormous old Thomas Morley \u2013 the sort of thing you\u2019d get in the Festival Hall playing Bach. It gave the song a fabulous start. Sunshine Superman is the sound of 1965, but the British release was actually delayed a year. After we recorded it, I had to go back to conducting panto at Watford Palace theatre. Then, the moment it was a hit, everyone wanted me as their arranger. I was so busy. I had entire string sections tearing round London on motorbikes. The 2CD anthology Donovan Retrospective is out now on Union Square Music. Donovan plays the London Palladium on 6 May. Tour details: donovan.ie.",

      "bodyText": "It feels a bit like cheating, but in the interests of full disclosure, I\u2019m writing this before the weekend. On Saturday, I\u2019m off to Japan \u2013 for a holiday and to do the Wings for Life World Run. That being so, I\u2019m tempted to invent a fantasy weekend of running: 5k PB at parkrun on Saturday, 10km PB on Sunday, recovery run Sunday evening sound good? Oh, OK then, I\u2019ll be squeezing in a quick track session on Saturday morning before sitting on a plane for 12 hours and trying not to go out of my mind with boredom. Instead, then, a brief explainer of the Wings for Life run, which doesn\u2019t seem very well known, but which I cannot recommend highly enough. The basic principle is that everyone starts at the same time at the locations around the world, regardless of time zone. A catcher car starts half an hour later, and very gradually speeds up. You are \u201cout\u201d when the car passes you. The result is that, unlike in most races, the fastest people run the longest.

On Saturday, I\u2019m off to Japan \u2013 for a holiday and to do the <a href=\"http://www.wingsforlifeworldrun.com/gb/en/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=wings%20for%20life%20world%20run&amp;utm_campaign=\">Wings for Life World Run</a>. That being so, I\u2019m tempted to invent a fantasy weekend of running: 5k PB at parkrun on Saturday, 10km PB on Sunday, recovery run Sunday evening sound good? Oh, OK then, I\u2019ll be squeezing in a quick track session on Saturday morning before sitting on a plane for 12 hours and trying not to go out of my mind with boredom.</p> <p>Instead, then, a brief explainer of the Wings for Life run, which doesn\u2019t seem very well known, but which I cannot recommend highly enough. The basic principle is that everyone starts at the same time at the locations around the world, regardless of time zone. A catcher car starts half an hour later, and very gradually speeds up. You are \u201cout\u201d when the car passes you. The result is that, unlike in most races, the fastest people run the longest.

And every week people have similar feelings when they go out at night with their friends. But&nbsp;nightlife is not only important because people enjoy it. Earning an estimated \u00a366bn a year and employing almost 8% of the workforce, Britain\u2019s night-time sector is of huge economic and cultural significance. This is why people who care about music should be concerned that nightclubs are closing. During the past 10 years the number has reduced from 3,144&nbsp;to 1,733. From the Arches in Glasgow to Garlands in Liverpool, London\u2019s Madame Jojo\u2019s and the Astoria, iconic venues are shutting their doors. London\u2019s Dance Tunnel is the latest to go. What happens at night is starting to concentrate minds, and rightly so. A commission is considering how London\u2019s night-time economy is managed, and night tube services are scheduled to start soon. Just last week, the Night Time Industries Association launched a national campaign, #nightlifematters. And it does matter, even if you\u2019re not a clubber. The Bristol club and dance music scene is acclaimed for the role it played in the early days of the influential bands Massive Attack and Portishead. Think also of Acid Jazz Records. Set up by entrepreneur and DJ Eddie Pillar in 1988, and influenced by cross-genre club culture from the 60s to the 80s, it signed bands including Incognito, Brand New Heavies and Jamiroquai \u2013 as well as running the Blue Note in east London, which in turn hosted nights put on by Talvin Singh and Goldie\u2019s Metalheadz. The well-documented relationship between the Ha\u00e7ienda in Manchester with Factory Records and bands including New Order and Happy Mondays \u2013 as well as DJ Mike Pickering, who formed M&nbsp;People \u2013 highlights the role nightclubs have in the incubation of talent. From techno, drum\u2019n\u2019bass and garage in the 90s to the&nbsp;grime genre today, artists such as Dizzee Rascal, Tinie Tempah and Wiley&nbsp;continue to thrive, yet the foundations on which they depend are&nbsp;now under intense pressure. Bars and clubs also play their part in&nbsp;urban regeneration. This was true in Liverpool in 1991, when Baa Bar opened, Cream established itself as one of the country\u2019s most successful club nights and a tapestry of fashion designers, recording studios, labels and graphic designers clustered around it. It remains true today, whether you look at Manchester, Brighton or Glasgow. Peckham in south London is unrecognisable from a decade or two ago: the Bussey Building and CLF Arts Cafe have been a big part of that change. Some businesses run out of steam, of course, and fashions change. But the steep increase in nightclub closures can be traced to changes in licensing and regulation. Over the past decade rules imposed by police and councils have developed in such a way that clubs are often now held responsible for crimes that occur at or even near them. No other business is punished when a crime happens on its premises, whether it is a bank robbery, a mugging at a shopping centre or a death in a car park. Yet attitudes to nightlife are different. In part this is because police forces facing cuts see nightlife as a drain on dwindling resources. Councils, meanwhile, face similar challenges and&nbsp;have to respond to complaints from&nbsp;people living near venues \u2013 sometimes in flats erected long after the businesses subsequently portrayed as&nbsp;nuisance neighbours. There is no societal justification for this erosion of the night economy. Serious crime has decreased in Britain in the past 10 years; people have never behaved as well as they do now.

      "bodyText": "Google, Gumtree and eBay have refused to ban adverts for a service which removes crucial pollution filters from the exhausts of diesel cars, sending toxic emissions soaring. Over a thousand diesel car owners have already been caught after removing the filter, though experts warn the problem may be far more widespread. Campaigners are now complaining to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that such adverts break its code, which bans motoring \u201cpractices that condone or encourage anti-social behaviour\u201d. The service exploits a loophole in the law which means that driving a diesel car without a filter is an offence, but the act of removing it is not. Air pollution is a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d, MPs said this week and particulate pollution causes 40,000 to 50,000 early deaths every year in the UK. But garages across the country are offering to remove diesel particulate filters (DPF), a practice ministers have labelled \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cclearly detrimental to people\u2019s health\u201d. DPF filters can become clogged, especially for diesels driven mostly in cities, and replacement can be expensive, leading garages to offer to remove the filters completely. Google and Gumtree say they accept the adverts for the service because removal itself is not illegal. Since 2014, cars missing DPF filters automatically fail the MOT test and, earlier this month, the Guardian revealed that 1,188 vehicles had been caught so far. But some garages boast on their websites that they can beat the visual MOT check. Friends of the Earth (FoE) is now complaining to the ASA over adverts for DPF removal services. Oliver Hayes, at FoE said: \u201cAir pollution is a public health crisis of breath-taking proportions. We\u2019re asking the ASA to clamp down on those advertising these dubious practices and help prevent more deadly pollution hitting our children\u2019s lungs.\u201d \u201cBut we\u2019re also calling on the government to make it illegal to remove these pollution filters in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless they do, the absurd loophole remains.\u201d The House of Commons environment audit committee is currently investigating diesel emissions and air quality and its chair, Mary Creagh MP, said: \u201cThe removal of DPF filters by rogue garages is another diesel test dodge which cheats the public out of clean air. The Department of Transport did the right thing in introducing visual checks into MOTs. But it should now look at tightening up MOTs and outlawing the removal of pollution filters altogether.\u201d \u201cOur changes to the MOT test are helping cut harmful emissions and are taking hundreds of polluting vehicles out of circulation,\u201d said a spokesman for the Department for Transport. \u201cWe are also investigating the latest technology so garages can carry out tougher, smarter tests that will act as a deterrent and keep these cars off the road.\u201d Google said it did not comment on individual cases and declined to take down DPF removal adverts. A spokeswoman said: \u201cOur policies require advertisers to comply with all applicable laws and local regulations. If we discover sites or services that are in violation of this policy we take appropriate action.\u201d Hannah Wilson, from Gumtree, said: \u201cOur policy for posting adverts on Gumtree is based on compliance with English law. As there are sometimes legitimate reasons for the removal of diesel particulate filters, and the removal of the DPF is not an offence, then these services can be offered by advertisers via Gumtree. If the practice of removing DPFs was outlawed, then we would immediately ban and remove these listings from the site.\u201d Repeated requests for comment from eBay received no reply. DPFs can be removed, cleaned and replaced, and there are many advertisements for this legitimate service, but other garages advertising \u201cDPF removal\u201d services make clear the filter is not replaced.",

We\u2019re asking the ASA to clamp down on those advertising these dubious practices and help prevent more deadly pollution hitting our children\u2019s lungs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut we\u2019re also calling on the government to make it illegal to remove these pollution filters in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless they do, the absurd loophole remains.\u201d</p> <p>The House of Commons <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/environmental-audit-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/diesel-emissions-and-air-quality-inquiry/\">environment audit committee is currently investigating diesel emissions and air quality</a> and its chair, Mary Creagh MP, said: \u201cThe removal of DPF filters by rogue garages is another diesel test dodge which cheats the public out of clean air. The Department of Transport did the right thing in introducing visual checks into MOTs. But it should now look at tightening up MOTs and outlawing the removal of pollution filters altogether.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur changes to the MOT test are helping cut harmful emissions and are taking hundreds of polluting vehicles out of circulation,\u201d said a spokesman for the Department for Transport. \u201cWe are also investigating the latest technology so garages can carry out tougher, smarter tests that will act as a deterrent and keep these cars off the road.\u201d</p> <p>Google said it did not comment on individual cases and declined to take down DPF removal adverts. A spokeswoman said: \u201cOur policies require advertisers to comply with all applicable laws and local regulations. If we discover sites or services that are in violation of this policy we take appropriate action.\u201d</p> <p>Hannah Wilson, from Gumtree, said: \u201cOur policy for posting adverts on Gumtree is based on compliance with English law. As there are sometimes legitimate reasons for the removal of diesel particulate filters, and the removal of the DPF is not an offence, then these services can be offered by advertisers via Gumtree. If the practice of removing DPFs was outlawed, then we would immediately ban and remove these listings from the site.\u201d Repeated requests for comment from eBay received no reply.</p> <p>DPFs can be removed, cleaned and replaced, and there are many advertisements for this legitimate service, but other garages advertising \u201cDPF removal\u201d services make clear the filter is not replaced.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shortly after arriving at a makeshift military jail, at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, in May 2010, I was placed into the black hole of solitary confinement for the first time. Within two weeks, I was contemplating suicide. After a month on suicide watch, I was transferred back to US, to a tiny 6 x 8ft (roughly 2 x 2.5 meter) cell in a place that will haunt me for the rest of my life: the US Marine Corps Brig in Quantico, Virginia. I was held there for roughly nine months as a \u201cprevention of injury\u201d prisoner, a designation the Marine Corps and the Navy used to place me in highly restrictive solitary conditions without a psychiatrist\u2019s approval. For 17 hours a day, I sat directly in front of at least two Marine Corps guards seated behind a one-way mirror. I was not allowed to lay down. I was not allowed to lean my back against the cell wall. I was not allowed to exercise. Sometimes, to keep from going crazy, I would stand up, walk around, or dance, as \u201cdancing\u201d was not considered exercise by the Marine Corps. To pass the time, I counted the hundreds of holes between the steel bars in a grid pattern at the front of my empty cell. My eyes traced the gaps between the bricks on the wall. I looked at the rough patterns and stains on the concrete floor \u2013 including one that looked like a caricature grey alien, with large black eyes and no mouth, that was popular in the 1990s. I could hear the \u201cdrip drop drip\u201d of a leaky pipe somewhere down the hall. I listened to the faint buzz of the fluorescent lights. For brief periods, every other day or so, I was escorted by a team of at least three guards to an empty basketball court-sized area. There, I was shackled and walked around in circles or figure-eights for 20 minutes. I was not allowed to stand still, otherwise they would take me back to my cell. I was only allowed a couple of hours of visitation each month to see my friends, family and lawyers, through a thick glass partition in a tiny 4 x 6ft room. My hands and feet were shackled the entire time. Federal agents installed recording equipment specifically to monitor my conversations, except with my lawyers. The United Nations special rapporteur on torture, Juan Mendez, condemned my treatment as \u201ccruel, inhuman and degrading treatment\u201d, describing \u201cthe excessive and prolonged isolation\u201d I was placed under for that period of time. However, he didn\u2019t stop there. In a preface to the 2014 Spanish edition of the Sourcebook on Solitary Confinement, written by M\u00e9ndez he strongly recommends against any use of solitary confinement beyond 15 days. As Mendez explains: Prolonged solitary confinement raises special concerns, because the risk of grave and irreparable harm to the detained person increases with the length of isolation and the uncertainty regarding its duration. In my public declarations on this theme, I have defined prolonged solitary confinement as any period in excess of 15 days. This definition reflects the fact that most of the scientific literature shows that, after 15 days, certain changes in brain functions occur and the harmful psychological effects of isolation can become irreversible. Unfortunately, conditions similar to the ones I experienced in 2010-11 are hardly unusual for the estimated 80,000 to 100,000 inmates held in these conditions across the US every day. In the time since my confinement at Quantico, public awareness of solitary confinement has improved by orders of magnitude. People all across the political spectrum \u2013 including some who have never been in solitary or known anyone who has \u2013 are now beginning to question whether this practice is a moral and ethical one. In June 2015, US supreme court justice Anthony Kennedy called the prison system \u201coverlooked\u201d and \u201cmisunderstood\u201d, stating that he welcomes a case that would allow the court to review whether or not solitary confinement is cruel and unusual under the US constitution. The evidence is overwhelming that it should be deemed as such: solitary confinement in the US is arbitrary, abused and unnecessary in many situations. It is cruel, degrading and inhumane, and is effectively a \u201cno touch\u201d torture. We should end the practice quickly and completely.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Overfishing is jeopardising a global tuna industry worth more than $42bn (\u00a329bn), according to the first assessment of its kind. A report produced by the Pew Charitable Trusts has highlighted the significant revenues that fishermen, processors and retailers are generating from severely depleted species of tuna. Taken together, the seven most commercially important tuna species \u2013 skipjack, albacore, bigeye, yellowfin, atlantic bluefin, Pacific bluefin and southern bluefin \u2013 generated $12bn (\u00a38bn) for fishermen in 2014, while the full value, including the total amount paid by the final consumer at supermarkets and restaurants around the world, was estimated to be $42bn (\u00a329bn). \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that tuna are big business,\u201d said Amanda Nickson, Pew\u2019s director of global tuna conservation. \u201cNow, for the first time, we\u2019re able to put an actual price on what\u2019s at stake in the fight for the conservation and sustainable management of these commercially and ecologically important fish.\u201d The report also highlights how tuna is a vital source of revenue to fishing communities, particularly Pacific Islands. The total catch in the Pacific Ocean was estimated at $22bn in 2014. Pew says that income will be at risk unless companies and governments, particularly Japan, US and those in the EU, can agree to catch limits that allow stocks to recover. Five out of the eight tuna species are at risk of extinction due to overfishing, according to conservationists. \u201cThe tussle at the moment is a lot to do with the fact that as the less affluent players, particularly the islands in the Pacific, realise the value of the resource they have, they will want to take a stake in that. And those who have historically fished it do not necessarily want to give that stake away. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see tuna stocks depleting because the countries involved can\u2019t agree sensibly on the management of them,\u201d said Nickson, who called for scientifically-informed catch limits to enable heavily depleted stocks, such as Pacific bluefin tuna, to recover and prevent others such as skipjack becoming overfished. Most of the tuna industry is currently paying \u201clip service\u201d to efforts to better manage tuna stocks, said Nickson, but she praised the steps being taken by some UK retailers and processors. Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda, M&amp;S, Morrisons and Co-op recently backed a call to cut yellowfin tuna catches in the Indian Ocean in an effort to help stocks recover. \u201cYou\u2019ve got two ways that we are going to see change in the supply chain,\u201d said Nickson. \u201cEither a regulatory process saying you can only catch this much, forcing the industry to adjust to that, or you are going to see market pressure from retailers saying we don\u2019t want to purchase from any place that can\u2019t actually demonstrate specific sustainability steps. Consumers should be able to buy tuna and not have to worry about where it is from. It is up to retailers and processors to better manage stocks.\u201d Much of the concern from conservation experts in recent years has centred on bluefin tuna stocks. Although not yet classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as endangered (it is listed as vulnerable), Pacific bluefin tuna has seen stocks depleted to less than 3% of its historic levels. It was just under 4% in 2012. The report estimated that the 17,000 metric tonnes of pacific bluefin caught in 2014 had a final value of $770m. In comparison, the 2.8m metric tonnes of skipjack caught in 2014, not currently overfished and most often used for canned tuna, had an end final value of $17.7bn.",

Guthrie has to front her first communications estimates committee on Thursday, just two days after the ABC is set to lose several million dollars in tied funding for the news division. She told staff in her first email address that she was awaiting news about the next triennial funding arrangement and would advise them about the outcome on Wednesday. The former managing director Mark Scott has been calling on Malcolm Turnbull to show his commitment to the ABC by maintaining the $20m a year the Gillard government had allocated for enhanced news services, which acknowledged the industry\u2019s loss of specialist reporting staff, the importance of local digital content and declining news investment in regions. One victim of the cut may be the fact-checking unit, which was set up as a special project in the news division under Labor. However, the cut is understood to be relatively small and the majority of the $20m the ABC received under the former Labor government is expected to be reallocated in Tuesday\u2019s budget. In the email Guthrie also flagged diversity as a key issue she would pursue in her term. The first female managing director of the ABC in its 83 years, Guthrie\u2019s mother is Chinese and she has worked extensively in Asia, most recently as Google\u2019s managing director of agencies for Asia-Pacific, based in Singapore. The Australian-born executive picked up on Mark Scott\u2019s departing comments about the ABC needing to be more diverse. \u201cAustralia is changing and we need to change with it,\u201d Guthrie told staff. \u201cShaped by my background and work experience, I passionately believe that the ABC should be relevant to all citizens. \u201cWe must extend our reach and our relevance into areas where we are under-represented. That means more diversity in both our staff and our content. We must collaborate more, with a clear focus on serving the audience, regardless of platform or device.\u201d She said she was optimistic and excited about her role and she hopes to \u201cunleash that creative spirit\u201d at the ABC. Guthrie had been at Google since 2011 but before that she worked in law in Sydney and then across Europe and Asia for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s broadcasting empire, including Foxtel, BSkyB and the Asia-based Star TV network.",

    "webTitle": "Corbyn ally Len McCluskey attacks \u2018treacherous\u2019 Labour MPs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A key ally of Jeremy Corbyn has accused MPs of employing treacherous tactics designed to undermine Labour\u2019s leader, as an analysis of the latest polls by a leading academic suggests the party is on course for its worst local election results for 35 years. Len McCluskey, the head of the UK\u2019s biggest union, Unite, claimed former shadow ministers Liz Kendall and Michael Dugher, Gordon Brown\u2019s former aide Ian Austin and newly elected MP Wes Streeting have made interventions meant to damage Corbyn. McCluskey\u2019s intervention comes as a new projection conducted for the Guardian shows that Labour is on course to lose 175 council seats in Thursday\u2019s elections . Such a result would be the worst local election performance in opposition since 1982 when voting took place against the background of the Falklands war. Labour\u2019s performance in the first nationwide electoral test since Corbyn won the party leadership with an overwhelming majority last year is seen in Westminster as a day of reckoning. The decision by McCluskey, the head of the the party\u2019s main financial backer, to escalate the party\u2019s row by naming names follows weeks of frustration over attacks by the party\u2019s MPs on Corbyn. It will be seen as a shot across the bows of some of Corbyn\u2019s harshest critics to ensure there is not a leadership challenge after Thursday\u2019s results come through. Both McCluskey and Labour MP Diane Abbott, a longstanding Corbyn supporter, claimed on Sunday that the damaging row over antisemitism, sparked by Ken Livingstone\u2019s controversial comments last week, is being manipulated for political ends. In an interview with the Guardian, McCluskey said that some MPs had been \u201cnothing short of treacherous\u201d and set \u201cstupid traps\u201d for Corbyn and his supporters by claiming the party should win a certain number of seats. \u201cWe have had Michael Dugher saying Jeremy has 99 days to prove himself and suddenly 5 May becomes a litmus test on Corbyn\u2019s ability to lead the party. \u201cWe have had Liz Kendall saying we should win 400 council seats. This is the woman who got 4.5% of the vote in the leadership election. We won\u2019t be taking lectures off people like that who are interested in setting false traps,\u201d he said. McCluskey said two other MPs instigated an internal party row last month after protesting that the fast food chain McDonald\u2019s had been banned from sponsoring a stall at Labour\u2019s conference. \u201cPeople like Wes Streeting and Ian Austin going on about McDonald\u2019s ... It is laughable. [McDonald\u2019s] is viciously anti-trade union and is attacking the bakers\u2019 union and has been ripping off young kids with zero-hours contracts. And suddenly we have Labour MPs coming to their rescue. It is not about McDonald\u2019s \u2013 it is about attacking Jeremy Corbyn,\u201d he said. McCluskey predicted the party would lose seats in Scotland and Wales but said that such results should not spark any moves from within the party against Corbyn. \u201c[Corbyn\u2019s team] have to be given time to get their message beyond the media who attack them every single day aided and abetted by a bunch of Labour MPs. It is as if they wake up every day and think \u2018What stick can we beat Jeremy Corbyn with today?\u2019\u201d he said. McCluskey claimed that Austin should face disciplinary procedures for showing \u201cdisrespect\u201d to Corbyn after Austin, the MP for Dudley North, had reportedly confronted Corbyn at a recent parliamentary Labour party meeting. \u201cSome of the individuals, including Ian Austin, are behaving despicably. Should that sort of disrespect be dealt with? I think it should, by the chief whip,\u201d he said. McCluskey was interviewed on Wednesday \u2013 after Labour MP Naz Shah apologised to parliament for writing that Israel could be moved to the US, but before Livingstone made remarks appearing to claim that Adolf Hitler was a supporter of Zionism. Austin said McCluskey\u2019s attack was \u201creally unfair\u201d. \u201cI am very surprised that the leader of a union I have been a member of for 30 years would say something like this without contacting me. \u201cWe are working really hard for these elections and everyone else should too,\u201d he said. Dugher said: \u201cI am not apologising for standing against antisemitism and for urging the leadership to do more which eventually they did. \u201cIts not a \u2018stupid test\u2019 to say that the Labour party must show that we are capable of ever winning a general election. Too many of Len\u2019s members can\u2019t afford endless Conservative governments.\u201d In response, Kendall said the party should this week show \u201cclear evidence\u201d that it can win in 2020 and maintained that the party should be aiming to win 400 council seats. \u201cThe people we came into politics to serve rely on us to deliver Labour councils and a realistic prospect of winning in 2020,\u201d she said. Streeting did not respond to a request for a comment. Using the average of the latest opinion poll results, including the Opinium/Observer poll carried out after the antisemitism row last week, Steve Fisher, of Oxford University, one of the country\u2019s leading elections experts, predicts that Labour could be on course for losses of 175 local council seats, while the Conservatives could gain 30. On the national equivalent vote share, which tends to be a good predictor of subsequent general elections, Labour looks likely to be one percentage point behind the Conservatives, Fisher calculates \u2013 on a par with 2011. That compares to the six-point lead achieved by Ed Miliband in the 2012 local elections; and approximately 15 points needed for a majority at a general election. Labour MPs will also be watching the party\u2019s performance in the Scottish parliament in Holyrood, and the Welsh assembly, closely. Some polls suggested Labour could even slip into third place in Scotland, behind a reinvigorated Conservative party led by the popular Ruth Davidson. Corbyn, who on Monday said that he and the party \u201cstand absolutely against racism in any form\u201d, has been requested by his Welsh colleagues not to visit the country amid fears that his intervention would not be helpful in a hard-fought contest, with Ukip keen to pick up seats. He has deliberately shifted his party to the left, basing its appeal on a strong anti-austerity message, which plays well in Labour heartlands. But if the party is to win a general election in 2020, it will also need to appeal to swing voters in traditionally Conservative areas. Council elections are notoriously difficult to predict, and Fisher points out that Labour could yet make some gains \u2013 or even worse losses than his central projection, based on the Conservatives\u2019 average poll lead of 3.8 percentage points, suggests. But as well as the number of seats won or lost, Corbyn\u2019s critics in parliament will also be closely watching the party\u2019s performance in bellwether councils such as Crawley, where it currently has 19 seats against the Tories\u2019 18. The Liberal Democrats could be set to win up to 90 local council seats this week, the new projections suggest, as they seek to rebuild their shattered power-base following the collapse of their share of the vote after they joined the coalition government in 2010. At a May Day rally on Sunday, Corbyn insisted that Labour is \u201cunited\u201d in opposing antisemitism. He has announced an independent review and pledged to tighten party codes of conduct in a bid to put a lid on the row \u2013 which has seen Shah and Livingstone suspended. Corbyn has received warnings \u2013 including from the London mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan - that the party would be punished in the 5 May elections. Opponents have accused him of acting too slowly to deal with incidents, most notably Livingstone\u2019s incendiary assertion that Hitler was a supporter of Zionism before he \u201cwent mad and ended up killing six million Jews\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>A key ally of Jeremy Corbyn has accused MPs of employing treacherous tactics designed to undermine Labour\u2019s leader, as an analysis of the latest polls by a leading academic suggests the party is on course for its worst local election results for 35 years.</p> <p>Len McCluskey, the head of the UK\u2019s biggest union, Unite, claimed former shadow ministers Liz Kendall and Michael Dugher, Gordon Brown\u2019s former aide Ian Austin and newly elected MP Wes Streeting have made interventions meant to damage Corbyn. </p> <p>McCluskey\u2019s intervention comes as a new projection conducted for the Guardian shows that Labour is on course to lose 175 council seats in Thursday\u2019s elections .</p> <p> Such a result would be the worst local election performance in opposition since 1982 when voting took place against the background of the Falklands war. </p> <p>Labour\u2019s performance in the first nationwide electoral test since Corbyn won the party leadership with an overwhelming majority last year is seen in Westminster as a day of reckoning.</p> <p>The decision by McCluskey, the head of the the party\u2019s main financial backer, to escalate the party\u2019s row by naming names follows weeks of frustration over attacks by the party\u2019s MPs on Corbyn. </p> <p>It will be seen as a shot across the bows of some of Corbyn\u2019s harshest critics to ensure there is not a leadership challenge after Thursday\u2019s results come through.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Both McCluskey and Labour MP Diane Abbott, a longstanding Corbyn supporter, claimed on Sunday that the damaging row over antisemitism, sparked by Ken Livingstone\u2019s controversial comments last week, is being manipulated for political ends.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, McCluskey said that some MPs had been \u201cnothing short of treacherous\u201d and set \u201cstupid traps\u201d for Corbyn and his supporters by claiming the party should win a certain number of seats.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cWe have had Michael Dugher saying Jeremy has 99 days to prove himself and suddenly 5 May becomes a litmus test on Corbyn\u2019s ability to lead the party.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cWe have had Liz Kendall saying we should win 400 council seats. This is the woman who got 4.5% of the vote in the leadership election. We won\u2019t be taking lectures off people like that who are interested in setting false traps,\u201d he said. </p> <p>McCluskey said two other MPs instigated an internal party row last month after protesting that the fast food chain McDonald\u2019s had been banned from sponsoring a stall at Labour\u2019s conference.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cPeople like Wes Streeting and Ian Austin going on about McDonald\u2019s ... It is laughable. [McDonald\u2019s] is viciously anti-trade union and is attacking the bakers\u2019 union and has been ripping off young kids with zero-hours contracts. And suddenly we have Labour MPs coming to their rescue. It is not about McDonald\u2019s \u2013 it is about attacking Jeremy Corbyn,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McCluskey predicted the party would lose seats in Scotland and Wales but said that such results should not spark any moves from within the party against Corbyn. </p> <p>\u201c[Corbyn\u2019s team] have to be given time to get their message beyond the media who attack them every single day aided and abetted by a bunch of Labour MPs. It is as if they wake up every day and think \u2018What stick can we beat Jeremy Corbyn with today?\u2019\u201d he said. <br /></p> <p>McCluskey claimed that Austin should face disciplinary procedures for showing \u201cdisrespect\u201d to Corbyn after Austin, the MP for Dudley North, had reportedly confronted Corbyn at a recent parliamentary Labour party meeting. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/01/local-elections-2016-how-judge-labour-result-jeremy-corbyn\">Local elections 2016: how to judge what Labour's result will mean for the party</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSome of the individuals, including Ian Austin, are behaving despicably. Should that sort of disrespect be dealt with? I think it should, by the chief whip,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McCluskey was interviewed on Wednesday \u2013 after Labour MP Naz Shah apologised to parliament for writing that Israel could be moved to the US, but<br />before Livingstone made remarks appearing to claim that Adolf Hitler was a supporter of Zionism.</p> <p>Austin said McCluskey\u2019s attack was \u201creally unfair\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI am very surprised that the leader of a union I have been a member of for 30 years would say something like this without contacting me. </p> <p>\u201cWe are working really hard for these elections and everyone else should too,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Dugher said: \u201cI am not apologising for standing against antisemitism and for urging the leadership to do more which eventually they did. <br /></p> <p>\u201cIts not a \u2018stupid test\u2019 to say that the Labour party must show that we are capable of ever winning a general election. Too many of Len\u2019s members can\u2019t afford endless Conservative governments.\u201d</p> <p>In response, Kendall said the party should this week show \u201cclear evidence\u201d that it can win in 2020 and maintained that the party should be aiming to win 400 council seats. </p> <p>\u201cThe people we came into politics to serve rely on us to deliver Labour councils and a realistic prospect of winning in 2020,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Streeting did not respond to a request for a comment. </p> <p>Using the average of the latest opinion poll results, including the Opinium/Observer poll carried out after the antisemitism row last week, Steve Fisher, of Oxford University, one of the country\u2019s leading elections experts, predicts that Labour could be on course for losses of 175 local council seats, while the Conservatives could gain 30.</p> <p>On the national equivalent vote share, which tends to be a good predictor of subsequent general elections, Labour looks likely to be one percentage point behind the Conservatives, Fisher calculates \u2013 on a par with 2011.</p> <p>That compares to the six-point lead achieved by Ed Miliband in the 2012 local elections; and approximately 15 points needed for a majority at a general election.</p> <p>Labour MPs will also be watching the party\u2019s performance in the Scottish parliament in Holyrood, and the Welsh assembly, closely. Some polls suggested Labour could even slip into third place in Scotland, behind a reinvigorated Conservative party led by the popular Ruth Davidson.</p> <p>Corbyn, who on Monday said that he and the party \u201cstand absolutely against racism in any form\u201d, has been requested by his Welsh colleagues not to visit the country amid fears that his intervention would not be helpful in a hard-fought contest, with Ukip keen to pick up seats.</p> <p>He has deliberately shifted his party to the left, basing its appeal on a strong anti-austerity message, which plays well in Labour heartlands. But if the party is to win a general election in 2020, it will also need to appeal to swing voters in traditionally Conservative areas.</p> <p>Council elections are notoriously difficult to predict, and Fisher points out that Labour could yet make some gains \u2013 or even worse losses than his central projection, based on the Conservatives\u2019 average poll lead of 3.8 percentage points, suggests.</p> <p>But as well as the number of seats won or lost, Corbyn\u2019s critics in parliament will also be closely watching the party\u2019s performance in bellwether councils such as Crawley, where it currently has 19 seats against the Tories\u2019 18.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats could be set to win up to 90 local council seats this week, the new projections suggest, as they seek to rebuild their shattered power-base following the collapse of their share of the vote after they joined the coalition government in 2010.</p> <p>At a May Day rally on Sunday, Corbyn insisted that Labour is \u201cunited\u201d in opposing antisemitism. He has announced an independent review and pledged to tighten party codes of conduct in a bid to put a lid on the row \u2013 which has seen Shah and Livingstone suspended. </p> <p>Corbyn has received warnings \u2013 including from the London mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan - that the party would be punished in the 5 May elections. <br /></p> <p>Opponents have accused him of acting too slowly to deal with incidents, most notably Livingstone\u2019s incendiary assertion that Hitler was a supporter of Zionism before he \u201cwent mad and ended up killing six million Jews\u201d. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Scrolling through photos on her mobile phone, Saliha Ben Ali stops at a picture of her son, Sabri, as a three-year-old sitting on Father Christmas\u2019s lap. Santa\u2019s white-gloved hands envelope Sabri\u2019s small torso and that of the little boy sitting to his right. Both lads stare straight ahead, looking slightly bewildered. \u201cTo think, they were the only guys who were scared of Santa Claus that day,\u201d Ben Ali recalls. \u201cNow both of them are dead.\u201d Sabri died in Syria aged 19, fighting for Isis, sometime between August 2013 and 8 December that year, when an unknown man telephoned Ben Ali\u2019s husband to tell them he had been killed. She is still haunted by the 10-second phone call in which the man said \u201ccongratulations, your son is a martyr\u201d. Bilal, the boy with whom Sabri shared Santa\u2019s lap as a toddler and later went to school with him in Brussels, died in Paris on 13 November 2015. He was the jihadi who detonated a suicide bomb outside the Stade de France football stadium during the murderous night of attacks. \u201cI was stunned when Sabri did what he did,\u201d Ben Ali says. \u201cI saw the signs before he went that something was wrong, that he was being manipulated, but there was nobody to help me. Then when I saw what Bilal did, I simply could not believe it.\u201d Bilal\u2019s mother, Fatima Hadfi, has described her 20-year-old son as having had the temperament of \u201ca ticking timebomb\u201d in the weeks before he blew himself up. But she was as unsure as Ben Ali as to where she might turn for help. \u201cThe first she knew of what her son had done was when she saw his image on her television screen two days after the attack,\u201d Ben Ali says. The 44-year-old Belgian social worker \u2013 \u201ceven with a job like that I couldn\u2019t save him\u201d, she says \u2013 is sitting in a workshop on family-based intervention in Berlin, which is an introduction to her becoming a family counsellor to help others whose relatives have been drawn into the jihadi radicalisation process, to try to win them back. \u201cDeradicalisation is a very underestimated part of counter-terrorism,\u201d says Daniel K\u00f6hler, who is running the course. One of just a handful of experts in the field anywhere in the world, he founded and directs the German Institute on Radicalisation and Deradicalisation Studies (Girds) in Berlin. \u201cFamily counselling is one of the most effective tools \u2026 nothing is a stronger source for creating a living counter-narrative to radical ideals than the deep attachments and emotions harnessed in a family. Even jihadi recruiters are unable to touch that.\u201d His pioneering approach, built on years of experience working on countering far-right extremism in Germany, is often described as a soft method. How favourably it is viewed by policymakers at any given time depends on current events, K\u00f6hler says. After high-profile attacks, such as those in Paris and Brussels, accusations abound that deradicalisation programmes do not work and governments and the public move towards more repressive measures, he explains. K\u00f6hler says there is no concrete way of measuring the success of his approach but he knows first-hand just how much call for the methods there is. He recently helped establish a nationwide counselling programme in the Netherlands, and was struck by the demand there was for the network even before it was up and running. \u201cEven as it was being set up, the team was dealing with very relevant high-security cases, there was just no time to waste,\u201d he says. K\u00f6hler describes his organisation as a bridge between families at risk and a whole network of social workers, teachers and security agencies, \u201ca neutral, reliable agent that the family can contact at any time, that can give them the tools to recognise radicalisation and react to it, without feeling they\u2019re in the role of snitches\u201d. He says he will inform security services in high-risk cases, often when the family requests it, but believes prevention and intervention have a vital role to play in counter-terrorism. At the workshop in a communist-era prefab in Berlin, Ben Ali shares her experiences with two other mothers. Christianne Boudreau\u2019s son Damian Clairmont, 22, left his native Canada for Syria to fight alongside Isis in late 2012. She heard of his death via Twitter in January 2014. Karolina Dam, a New Zealand-born Danish citizen, lost her 18-year-old son Lukas a year ago when he was killed in the Syrian border town of Kobani during a US-led coalition airstrike. The women, who formed Mothers for Life, a network of mothers who have lost their children to jihadi battle groups, now counsel other families who want help to bring their relatives back from the brink, adamant that no other parent should go through what they have. K\u00f6hler outlines the importance of taking a tailor-made approach to each case, invariably involving a young person who is in the process of being recruited by a jihadi group. He has repeatedly seen how such groups try to create conflict within a family of someone they are targeting. He gives an example of a family he helped, where the son, a convert to Islam, was showing increasing signs that he was being radicalised and repeatedly sought to provoke his family and create conflict. \u201cThe son came home one day to find his mum drinking a glass of wine and listening to Mozart. Concerned about her chances of entering paradise, he told her she\u2019d burn in hell for that,\u201d K\u00f6hler recalls. The son went back to the jihadi group and recounted the incident, to be told that his mother was an infidel who would never understand his faith. \u201cSuddenly, the mother drinking wine, in the context of the jihadi struggle for good versus evil, is put on a par with the US bombing Iraq, and over time the group managed to distance the son completely from his family.\u201d Ben Ali can immediately relate to his account. \u201cThis is exactly what they did with us,\u201d she tells the group. \u201cThey used the fact that I am Shia to drive a wedge between us. My son would say to me: \u2018Please, Mum, don\u2019t pray like that anymore.\u2019 I\u2019d say: \u2018Like what?\u2019. \u2018Like Shia.\u2019 When he went to Syria the first call I got from him was him saying: \u2018Mama, please don\u2019t stay Shia. They are not proper Muslim.\u2019 I assured him I would find my own way to Jannah [paradise], but that I would stay Shia.\u201d K\u00f6hler talks of the importance of families looking for a mediator, such as an Imam within the community to whom they can turn. But in a poignant moment, Ben Ali speaks out. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say, but it\u2019s not easy to do. I looked for an Imam in Belgium who would mediate between me and my son, but they just said to me: \u2018What are you worried about? He wants to go and help his Muslim brothers. He\u2019s practising Islam like we all should be doing.\u2019\u201d If she knew then what she knows now, she would have \u201clocked him in a room to keep him safe\u201d, she says. In cases of people who have left to join jihadis in Syria or elsewhere, the chances of getting them back are slim, K\u00f6hler says. \u201cMaybe 5%.\u201d So the key is to stop them going in the first place. He recalls \u201cnight-time conversations with mothers and sisters calling to say a son is on Skype from Syria, his father is talking to him in the next room, and our job is to try to keep him chatting\u201d. K\u00f6hler says the longer the dialogue can be kept up \u2013 talking about the family pet, fond memories of family life \u2013 the higher the chance is to save them. Much of K\u00f6hler\u2019s work is done on a pro bono basis, with the counselling often done online, mainly from his Berlin bedsit, at all hours of the day and night. Funding is tight and he is constantly being asked by government agencies from the UK to the US, who invite him to outline his methods, to justify the value of what he does. \u201cIt\u2019s so plain to me that the key to a lot of counter-terrorism lies within the circle of family and friends,\u201d he says. To back this up he cites recent research showing that even in cases of terrorists who are believed to have carried out operations alone, family and friends were in the know about their intentions to commit the act almost three-quarters of the time. Ben Ali is still not convinced she could have stopped her son, but she does feel empowered by the idea that she may be able to help prevent someone else\u2019s family from being torn apart. \u201cThat\u2019s so important to me,\u201d she says, glancing on her phone screen at a black and white portrait of herself and Sabri. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not naive enough to think we\u2019re not going to lose lots more of our boys and girls.\u201d",

Santa\u2019s white-gloved hands envelope Sabri\u2019s small torso and that of the little boy sitting to his right. Both lads stare straight ahead, looking slightly bewildered. \u201cTo think, they were the only guys who were scared of Santa Claus that day,\u201d Ben Ali recalls. \u201cNow both of them are dead.\u201d</p> <p>Sabri died in Syria aged 19, fighting for Isis, sometime between August 2013 and 8 December that year, when an unknown man telephoned Ben Ali\u2019s husband to tell them he had been killed.

He was the jihadi who detonated a suicide bomb outside the Stade de France football stadium during the murderous night of attacks.<br /></p> <p>\u201cI was stunned when Sabri did what he did,\u201d Ben Ali says. \u201cI saw the signs before he went that something was wrong, that he was being manipulated, but there was nobody to help me. Then when I saw what Bilal did, I simply could not believe it.\u201d</p> <p>Bilal\u2019s mother, Fatima Hadfi, has described her 20-year-old son as having had the temperament of \u201ca ticking timebomb\u201d in the weeks before he blew himself up. But she was as unsure as Ben Ali as to where she might turn for help.</p> <p>\u201cThe first she knew of what her son had done was when she saw his image on her television screen two days after the attack,\u201d Ben Ali says.<br /></p> <p>The 44-year-old Belgian social worker \u2013 \u201ceven with a job like that I couldn\u2019t save him\u201d, she says \u2013 is sitting in a workshop on family-based intervention in Berlin, which is an introduction to her becoming a family counsellor to help others whose relatives have been drawn into the jihadi radicalisation process, to try to win them back.</p> <p>\u201cDeradicalisation is a very underestimated part of counter-terrorism,\u201d says Daniel K\u00f6hler, who is running the course. One of just a handful of experts in the field anywhere in the world, he founded and directs the <a href=\"http://www.girds.org/\">German Institute on Radicalisation and Deradicalisation Studies</a> (Girds) in Berlin. \u201cFamily counselling is one of the most effective tools \u2026 nothing is a stronger source for creating a living counter-narrative to radical ideals than the deep attachments and emotions harnessed in a family. Even jihadi recruiters are unable to touch that.\u201d</p> <p>His pioneering approach, built on years of experience working on countering far-right extremism in Germany, is often described as a soft method. How favourably it is viewed by policymakers at any given time depends on current events, K\u00f6hler says. After high-profile attacks, such as those in Paris and Brussels, accusations abound that deradicalisation programmes do not work and governments and the public move towards more repressive measures, he explains. </p> <p>K\u00f6hler says there is no concrete way of measuring the success of his approach but he knows first-hand just how much call for the methods there is.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adccafbf49cfc0bbf36cee991f6b7b6b0657f64e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adccafbf49cfc0bbf36cee991f6b7b6b0657f64e/0_24_948_569/500.jpg\" alt=\"Bilal Hadfi\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bilal Hadfi detonated a suicide bomb outside the Stade de France football stadium during the Paris attacks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KOS/Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He recently helped establish a nationwide counselling programme in the Netherlands, and was struck by the demand there was for the network even before it was up and running. \u201cEven as it was being set up, the team was dealing with very relevant high-security cases, there was just no time to waste,\u201d he says. </p> <p>K\u00f6hler describes his organisation as a bridge between families at risk and a whole network of social workers, teachers and security agencies, \u201ca neutral, reliable agent that the family can contact at any time, that can give them the tools to recognise radicalisation and react to it, without feeling they\u2019re in the role of snitches\u201d. He says he will inform security services in high-risk cases, often when the family requests it, but believes prevention and intervention have a vital role to play in counter-terrorism.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/isis-islamic-state-mothers-for-life\">Mothers of Isis recruits find healing and resolve through support network</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the workshop in a communist-era prefab in Berlin, Ben Ali shares her experiences with two other mothers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/isis-islamic-state-mothers-for-life\">Christianne Boudreau\u2019s son Damian Clairmont</a>, 22, left his native Canada for Syria to fight alongside Isis in late 2012.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pop, the cultural revolution of the late 20th century, has touched art, poetry, fiction, and everything musical, with its hot white wand. In the beginning, in the 1960s, pop was sex and drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll: a way of life. A lot of young journalists covered it, but very few transcended the genre to create a narrative that would outlive the generation that hoped it would die before it got old. Awopbop\u2026, however, a luminously clear, aerial survey of an extraordinary phenomenon, set the gold standard that others would follow. Nik Cohn\u2019s dispatch from the frontline of rock is about to turn 50 (its author is now in his 70s) and is still as evergreen and wild eyed as it was when it burst on to the scene, with a snarl and a stamping foot, in 1969. Since then, many Scandinavian forests have been laid waste to describe the pop revolution, with names such as Greil Marcus, Philip Norman and Jon Savage jostling for attention at the front of a crowded field, but Nik Cohn was the first. No one had taken the subject quite as seriously as he did. There was nothing before him and there has been nothing quite as raw or as memorable since. Different, yes; sweeter, for sure; more searching, possibly; but never as fearless, flashy or straight-out thrilling. Written in a white heat, like some of the best journalism, Awopbop\u2026 supplied the last word. Here, in 250 pages, was a new form: rock criticism. This was a new kind of critical discourse, the strange fruit of a personal and passionate love affair, smoking with teenage intensity. \u201cFrom the first blast of Tutti Frutti,\u201d writes Cohn, \u201crock\u2019n\u2019roll had possessed me, body and soul.\u201d From 1956 to 1968, the year Cohn signed off, he covered the \u201cfirst mad rush\u201d of a phenomenon that would eventually morph into disco, heavy metal, grunge, glam, techno, punk and many bizarre sub-genres. At first, Cohn wrote as a freelance, prowling the streets of Soho, and later for the uber-cool Queen magazine. Eventually, he got a job \u201cpontificating on yoof\u201d for the Observer. The celebrated record producer (and manager of the Who) Kit Lambert recalls Cohn showing up \u201cabout 1963\u201d as a \u201cthin young man \u2013 he looked about 14 \u2013 wearing carefully dirtied-down sneakers\u201d. Cohn\u2019s approach was perfectly in tune with his subject. He writes: \u201cRock in the late 60s was still a spontaneous combustion. Nobody bothered with long-term strategies; hanging on once the thrill was gone was unthinkable. If anyone had told me then that the Stones or the Who would still be treading the boards in 30-plus years, I\u2019d have thought they were out of their minds.\u201d Cohn, the son of the historian Norman Cohn, author of a cult classic, The Pursuit of the Millennium, had grown up in Ireland, but escaped to London by 1963, \u201cthe year the Beatles broke through, and the climate seemed to change by the day\u201d. The metropolitan feeding frenzy he became part of was not confined to rock\u2019n\u2019roll. He writes that \u201cnewspaper editors, book publishers, fashion mags and film financiers were all caught up in the same fever. Almost overnight, being a teen degenerate was the hottest ticket around.\u201d By the time he was 22, these heady days were done. \u201cEven as I was pigging out on the moment,\u201d Cohn recalls, \u201crock and pop were already changing. The world I knew and savoured was basically an outlaw trade, peopled with adventurers, snake-oil salesmen, inspired lunatics. But their time was almost over. The scene was becoming more industrial. Accountants and corporate fat cats were fast driving out the wild men.\u201d Before long, rock had become \u201cjust another branch of commerce, no more or less exotic than autos or detergents\u201d. Cohn\u2019s account of this \u201cmad rush\u201d is at once an elegy, a retrospective and a lingering goodbye. In 1968, he took a publisher\u2019s advance and holed up in Connemara for seven weeks to write the first draft of what would become a kind of farewell to arms. \u201cMy purpose was simple,\u201d he said later, \u201cto catch the feel, the pulse of rock, as I had lived through it\u2026 I simply wrote off the top of my head, whatever and however the spirit moved me. Accuracy didn\u2019t seem of prime importance. What I was after was guts, and flash, and energy, and speed. Those were the things I\u2019d treasured in the rock I\u2019d loved.\u201d Awopbop\u2026 was the result: subjective, unruly and unintentionally definitive. Questions about good and/or bad were afterthoughts and accidental. Cohn was riffing off memories and impressions. \u201cDid Dion\u2019s Ruby Baby have any aesthetic value?\u201d he asks. \u201cWho cared ? What it had was dirty magic \u2013 the slurred, sex-drunk vocal, those shambolic handclaps, the whole glorious unmade bed.\u201d From Bill Haley to Jimi Hendrix, Cohn runs the gamut of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, with chapters on Elvis Presley, the twist, Phil Spector, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Bob Dylan, even the Monkees. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve written about,\u201d he concludes, \u201chas been the rise and fall of Superpop, the noise machine, and the image, hype and beautiful flash of rock\u2019n\u2019roll music. Elvis riding on his golden Cadillac, James Brown throwing off his robes in a fit, Pete Townshend slaughtering his audience with his machine-gun guitar, Mick Jagger hanging off his mike like Tarzan Weissmuller in the jungle, PJ Proby \u2013 all the heroic acts of pulp.\u201d Cohn was never American, but the wild chords of 60s\u2019 new journalism had left their mark on his style, shaping it into the perfect medium for a new kind of reportage, the journalism of correspondents in motley and denim, not mufti or combat fatigues. Finally, the last war was over, replaced by peace and love and the illusion of immortality. A signature sentence \u201cAll that\u2019s left now is the image, the vision of Elvis as he was when he was 21, 22, strutting and swaggering, hanging his grin out, putting on the agony, and freewheeling through everything.\u201d Three to compare George Melly: Revolt Into Style (1970) Greil Marcus: Mystery Train (1975) Jon Savage: England\u2019s Dreaming: The Sex Pistols and Punk Rock (1991)",

      "body": "<p>Pop, the cultural revolution of the late 20th century, has touched art, poetry, fiction, and everything musical, with its hot white wand. In the beginning, in the 1960s, pop was sex and drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll: a way of life. A lot of young journalists covered it, but very few transcended the genre to create a narrative that would outlive the generation that hoped it would die before it got old. <em>Awopbop\u2026,</em> however, a luminously clear, aerial survey of an extraordinary phenomenon, set the gold standard that others would follow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/sep/11/nonsense-lyrics-little-richard-tutti-frutti-60-years-britney-spears\">Awopbopaloomopalopbombom! Sometimes the best lyrics mean nothing at all</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nik Cohn\u2019s dispatch from the frontline of rock is about to turn 50 (its author is now in his 70s) and is still as evergreen and wild eyed as it was when it burst on to the scene, with a snarl and a stamping foot, in 1969. Since then, many Scandinavian forests have been laid waste to describe the pop revolution, with names such as Greil Marcus, Philip Norman and Jon Savage jostling for attention at the front of a crowded field, but Nik Cohn was the first. No one had taken the subject quite as seriously as he did. There was nothing before him and there has been nothing quite as raw or as memorable since. Different, yes; sweeter, for sure; more searching, possibly; but never as fearless, flashy or straight-out thrilling. Written in a white heat, like some of the best journalism, <em>Awopbop\u2026</em> supplied the last word. Here, in 250 pages, was a new form: rock criticism.</p> <p>This was a new kind of critical discourse, the strange fruit of a personal and passionate love affair, smoking with teenage intensity. \u201cFrom the first blast of Tutti Frutti,\u201d writes Cohn, \u201crock\u2019n\u2019roll had possessed me, body and soul.\u201d From 1956 to 1968, the year Cohn signed off, he covered the \u201cfirst mad rush\u201d of a phenomenon that would eventually morph into disco, heavy metal, grunge, glam, techno, punk and many bizarre sub-genres.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"590b6002b37a2651aee8d2a969a209f289358e2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/590b6002b37a2651aee8d2a969a209f289358e2a/0_0_1550_2272/682.jpg\" alt=\"Elvis Presley in Jailhouse Rock (1957).\" width=\"682\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elvis Presley in Jailhouse Rock (1957).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At first, Cohn wrote as a freelance, prowling the streets of Soho, and later for the uber-cool <em>Queen</em> magazine. Eventually, he got a job \u201cpontificating on yoof\u201d for the <em>Observer</em>. The celebrated record producer (and manager of the Who) Kit Lambert recalls Cohn showing up \u201cabout 1963\u201d as a \u201cthin young man \u2013 he looked about 14 \u2013 wearing carefully dirtied-down sneakers\u201d. Cohn\u2019s approach was perfectly in tune with his subject. He writes: \u201cRock in the late 60s was still a spontaneous combustion. Nobody bothered with long-term strategies; hanging on once the thrill was gone was unthinkable. If anyone had told me then that the Stones or the Who would still be treading the boards in 30-plus years, I\u2019d have thought they were out of their minds.\u201d</p> <p>Cohn, the son of the historian Norman Cohn, author of a cult classic, <em>The Pursuit of the Millennium</em>, had grown up in Ireland, but escaped to London by 1963, \u201cthe year the Beatles broke through, and the climate seemed to change by the day\u201d. The metropolitan feeding frenzy he became part of was not confined to rock\u2019n\u2019roll. He writes that \u201cnewspaper editors, book publishers, fashion mags and film financiers were all caught up in the same fever. Almost overnight, being a teen degenerate was the hottest ticket around.\u201d</p> <p>By the time he was 22, these heady days were done. \u201cEven as I was pigging out on the moment,\u201d Cohn recalls, \u201crock and pop were already changing. The world I knew and savoured was basically an outlaw trade, peopled with adventurers, snake-oil salesmen, inspired lunatics. But their time was almost over. The scene was becoming more industrial. Accountants and corporate fat cats were fast driving out the wild men.\u201d Before long, rock had become \u201cjust another branch of commerce, no more or less exotic than autos or detergents\u201d.</p> <p>Cohn\u2019s account of this \u201cmad rush\u201d is at once an elegy, a retrospective and a lingering goodbye. In 1968, he took a publisher\u2019s advance and holed up in Connemara for seven weeks to write the first draft of what would become a kind of farewell to arms. \u201cMy purpose was simple,\u201d he said later, \u201cto catch the feel, the pulse of rock, as I had lived through it\u2026 I simply wrote off the top of my head, whatever and however the spirit moved me. Accuracy didn\u2019t seem of prime importance. What I was after was guts, and flash, and energy, and speed. Those were the things I\u2019d treasured in the rock I\u2019d loved.\u201d</p> <p><em>Awopbop\u2026 </em>was the result: subjective, unruly and unintentionally definitive. Questions about good and/or bad were afterthoughts and accidental. Cohn was riffing off memories and impressions. \u201cDid Dion\u2019s Ruby Baby have any aesthetic value?\u201d he asks. \u201cWho cared ? What it had was dirty magic \u2013 the slurred, sex-drunk vocal, those shambolic handclaps, the whole glorious unmade bed.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRjviO8negQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xRjviO8negQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Dion - Ruby Baby</figcaption> </figure>   <p>From Bill Haley to Jimi Hendrix, Cohn runs the gamut of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, with chapters on Elvis Presley, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/04/50-years-of-the-twist-richard-williams\">twist</a>, Phil Spector, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Bob Dylan, even the Monkees. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve written about,\u201d he concludes, \u201chas been the rise and fall of Superpop, the noise machine, and the image, hype and beautiful flash of rock\u2019n\u2019roll music. Elvis riding on his golden Cadillac, James Brown throwing off his robes in a fit, Pete Townshend slaughtering his audience with his machine-gun guitar, Mick Jagger hanging off his mike like Tarzan Weissmuller in the jungle, PJ Proby \u2013 all the heroic acts of pulp.\u201d Cohn was never American, but the wild chords of 60s\u2019 new journalism had left their mark on his style, shaping it into the perfect medium for a new kind of reportage, the journalism of correspondents in motley and denim, not mufti or combat fatigues. Finally, the last war was over, replaced by peace and love and the illusion of immortality.</p> <h2>A signature sentence</h2> <p>\u201cAll that\u2019s left now is the image, the vision of Elvis as he was when he was 21, 22, strutting and swaggering, hanging his grin out, putting on the agony, and freewheeling through everything.\u201d</p> <h2>Three to compare</h2> <p>George Melly: <em>Revolt Into Style</em> (1970)</p> <p>Greil Marcus: <em>Mystery Train</em> (1975)</p> <p>Jon Savage: <em>England\u2019s Dreaming: The Sex Pistols and Punk Rock</em> (1991)</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s decision to live-tweet the military operation that culminated in the death of Osama bin Laden \u201cas if it were happening today\u201d has been criticised as a distasteful \u201cvictory lap\u201d and PR exercise. Osama bin Laden was killed on 2 May 2011 after a raid on his compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan by United States Navy Seal commandos. The series of tweets \u2013 complete with diagrams of the compound that the al-Qaida leader was killed in \u2013 marked five years since \u201cOperation Neptune Spear\u201d. The CIA announced to its 1.33m followers on Twitter that it would be tweeting the raid on Sunday using the hashtag #UBLRaid. In a preamble, the CIA praised the success of the mission as the \u201cculmination of years of complex, thorough and highly advanced intel ops &amp; analyses led by CIA w support of [intelligence community].\u201d \u201cDeath of Usama Bin Ladin [sic] marked significant victory in US-led campaign to disrupt, dismantle, &amp; defeat al-Qaida,\u201d it went on. It also detailed the compound in which Bin Laden was found, and the features that led to its discovery including \u201ctrash burned not collected\u201d. From 1:25pm EDT, the CIA began live-tweeting the raid, blow-by-blow as it played out in 2011, starting with the operation being approved by US president Barack Obama, CIA director Leon Panetta and vice admiral William H. McRaven of the Joint Special Operations Command. The series of tweets took in the helicopter raid and its fallout, as well as the the mission on the ground. The tweet announcing the death of \u201cUsama Bin Ladin\u201d had been retweeted 2,400 times and favourited 1,700 times at time of writing. The series concluded with praise of the \u201cdaring ... team effort\u201d, linking to a \u201cfeatured story\u201d wrap and a more detailed timeline on the CIA\u2019s website. The series was met with a mix of flippant jokes \u2013 including the omnipresent \u201cMichael Jordan crying\u201d meme \u2013 and criticism. Many more Twitter users questioned the thinking behind the stunt. The Daily Show asked the CIA to \u201cstop it\u201d.

Under today\u2019s restless skies, they look almost Dolomitic in drama, though perhaps not in size. Ribblesdale has been worked right down to its limestone bones, which shine like new teeth in the sun\u2019s shifting limelight. Sheep and new lambs graze around giant boulders dropped by glaciers, picking the land as clean as the ice once did. Outcroppings of shin-smooth limestone pavement, weathered into rippling patterns, merge with countless miles of dry stone walls. Quarries have created holes the size of cruise ships in the hills. Yet this earth carries memories deeper than a Craven cavern. The chatter of rooks accompanies us as we peer inside the vast Victoria Cave, which has yielded yet more bones; those of hippos, hyenas, elephants and rhinos. I can never quite get over the thought that all this limestone is a legacy of the teeming tropical seas of the Carboniferous, of corals and other sea creatures living and dying in such quantities that their piled skeletal remains formed strata; or that this ancient life is constantly being re-ingested by our own bodies. As the weak acid of rainwater erodes the limestone, forming canyons and caverns, the calcium that was once a part of those living creatures is released into the food chain. WH Auden imagined heaven to be a limestone landscape, perhaps because this is where the line between life and death seems most soluble. The water also dissolves the false dichotomy between the vitality of living things and the permanence of rock, connecting them through chemistry, creating what Robert Macfarlane called \u201ca loop of stone and bone\u201d. Life runs like a Yorkshire Dales river, disappearing into the complex karst underworld and resurfacing somewhere else. Back near Settle, my eye recognises a movement in a field before my brain can register its source. House martins are writing calligraphy in the air again after a six-month sojourn in Africa, performing their own trick of resurrection in their return to Yorkshire.

Outcroppings of shin-smooth limestone pavement, weathered into rippling patterns, merge with countless miles of dry stone walls. Quarries have created holes the size of cruise ships in the hills. Yet this earth carries <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craven_Fault_System\">memories deeper than a Craven cavern</a>.

As the weak acid of rainwater erodes the limestone, forming canyons and caverns, the calcium that was once a part of those living creatures is released into the food chain.</p> <p>WH Auden <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Praise_of_Limestone\">imagined heaven to be a limestone landscape</a>, perhaps because this is where the line between life and death seems most soluble. The water also dissolves the false dichotomy between the vitality of living things and the permanence of rock, connecting them through chemistry, creating what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/robert-macfarlane\">Robert Macfarlane</a> called \u201ca loop of stone and bone\u201d.

      "bodyText": "There are easier challenges in the theatre than taking on Strindberg. Temperamental both as a man and an intellect, Strindberg\u2019s playwriting was no place for his passions to find cool respite, but a crucible in which to explore their fury. The 19th century artist, who is as famous for his essays, novels, poetry and painting in his native Sweden as he is in the rest of the world for his plays, is often considered the father of Swedish literature, but he\u2019s a problematic parent; his contemporary reputation bears both direct accusations of misogyny and anti-semitism, and the reasonable consideration that his constantly shifting opinions on such things were social experiments to explore the characterisation of their ideas in his work. Miss Julie, written in 1888 and first performed the following year, is similarly as much a radical essay in the inherent drama of the human character as it is a work for the theatre. For Strindberg, observing the unstable nature of the human character under emotional pressure was more interesting than imposing the artificial events of a conventional plot, and the play\u2019s simple premise of a servant and a count\u2019s daughter who succumb to an annihilating mutual attraction after a drunken party one Midsummer Eve is built of the complex emotional engagements that lead up to the act, and afflict its participants afterwards. It was first published with a lengthy introduction from the author explaining it as a product of naturalism, the then-radical literary theory that forensic dissection of ordinary human lives, including details of speech, dress and interiors, in art could lead to a greater understanding of universal humanity. That 128-year-old introduction is relevant to understanding how director Kip Williams has executed his production of Miss Julie for the Melbourne Theatre Company, and the challenge its stylistics present \u2013 because in the intervening years, the once-radical naturalism of the theatre has been destroyed by the capacity of cinema and television to replicate the details of real human lives far more closely than people walking around a stage in front of an auditorium full of people ever could. Williams has embraced the contemporary contradiction of naturalism in the theatre by using the very technology that usurped it. While servant Jean and his mistress, Miss Julie fight, flirt, fuck and fall apart \u2013 sometimes in front of Jean\u2019s casual fiancee, Kristin, sometimes not \u2013 they\u2019re trailed by a near-invisible live camera crew feeding footage both intimate and sometimes stalkerish to a screen that hangs over the set. With a designer as good as Alice Babidge providing set and costume and Paul Jackson lighting it, the simultaneous imagery of theatre and screen is visually beautiful to behold, without ever distracting from the sometimes bleak, sometimes mundane tragedies taking place within the story. As well as it is done, however, Williams\u2019s device is not original; it was British director Katie Mitchell who famously innovated the same device in the same play in her famous Schaubuhne production the Guardian reviewed in its season at the London\u2019s Barbican in 2013. I did not see that production, but am aware it was used to explore the story from Kristin\u2019s point of view. This is not the case in Williams\u2019s version, where the cameras recruit the audience into the role of the Count\u2019s servants, never seen on the stage, but always known to be present, and able to see all. It\u2019s an excellent acknowledgement of Strindberg\u2019s strident class politics \u2013 the limitations of role and restrictions of opportunity forced by class hierarchies are what, of course, keep the turn-of-the-century lovers apart, poison their attraction and drive the emotional catastrophe that results from their forbidden encounter. But it is a missed note of an otherwise electric production that Williams lacks an ear to the class dynamics of Australian speech, because Mark Leonard Winter\u2019s performance as the ambitious Jean, frustrated by his class, is so good that recognising the class reality of his origins is a detail an Australian production deserves. Alas, a lack of recognising that Australian classes have cultural differences is a problem Williams shares with other directors of his theatrical generation: Matt Lutton marred his otherwise brilliant Night on Bald Mountain for failing to realise Miss Summerhayes\u2019s class difference from her aristocratic employers and Simon Stone\u2019s otherwise very good film adaptation of his play Wild Duck, The Daughter, is let down by sacked timber workers in a depressed town who take to sudden unemployment with a happy-go-lucky bon vivance. The omission is more indicative of a broader cultural problem in the theatre than a fatal flaw of this particular Miss Julie. Winter is passionate, invested and immersed in what he\u2019s doing and Robin McLeavy is stunning, her performance so broad-ranged, engaged and responsive that the escalating love-or-death tension between Jean and Julie injects exciting levels of risk and doubt even into this hoary, canonical, century-old play. As Kristin, Zahra Newman\u2019s contribution is no less affecting for creating the moments of tenderness amidst the conflagrations. If Williams is not doing anything very new with his Miss Julie, the victory of his production is he has the directorial sense to do it with the energy Strindberg demands. Miss Julie is at the Melbourne Theatre Company until 21 May",

New Zealander William Trubridge set his 16th world mark, beating his own record of 121 metres. The latest dive saw him hold his breath for four minutes and 24 seconds. In a video posted by Trubridge\u2019s diving company Vertical Blue, Trubridge said the dive was \u201cpretty difficult\u201d. \u201cI had a beautiful descent, everything went well with the descent,\u201d he said. At the bottom of the descent, Trubridge ran into difficulties attaching a tag to his leg, and said his ascent to the surface was \u201cterrible\u201d. \u201cAt that point I was completely out of the headspace that I need to be in for a deep dive,\u201d he said. \u201cWith my focus off, I was not in the right head space, not in the place I like to be, to complete my dive with ease or confidence, in fact as I neared the surface I thought I might have a big black out at the top.\u201d When Trubridge did surface, taking deep gulps of air, dozens of observers floating around his dive site fell silent- before breaking into rapturous applause. The dive was particularly special for Trubridge as his parents, David and Linda, and brother Sam had travelled to the Bahamas to witness his attempt. It was the first time Trubridge\u2019s father had seen his son attempt a world record. \u201cWe lived on the ocean on a yacht for ten years, it was our home and for him the sea was his back garden, it was his playground,\u201d said David Trubridge. \u201cSo it made sense for him to do this kind of thing.\u201d Linda Trubridge said it was \u201cthe most wonderful thing\u201d to see her son do what he does best. On his website Trubridge wrote that free diving was like being in an endless dream. \u201cI have a relationship with the depths,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey beckon me beyond my means, cold, dark, vacant pressure, forever night, endless dreams.\u201d Trubridge will attempt another world record in the Bahamas on Tuesday morning.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After releasing his 2014 novel Analogue Men, Australian novelist Nick Earls began kicking around a few new story ideas. He assembled the best five and instinctively felt they would each hit the 20,000 word mark \u2013 the \u201cnovella\u201d grey zone between a short story and a novel. \u201cMy first thought was no publisher is going to welcome me knocking on the door with that,\u201d Earls explains. Earls is releasing these novellas on the first of every month under the umbrella title Wisdom Tree, starting with Gotham released on Monday. Audiobook versions are being simultaneously released on Audible, narrated by Australian actors Rhys Muldoon, Flynn Curry, Gyton Grantley, Michael Dorman and William McInnes. The publishing industry has never been a fan of the novella, and the reason is purely economical: with fixed-price overheads like printing, binding, warehousing, distribution and marketing, it costs almost as much to make a small book as it does a medium-sized one. But readers expect a slimmer copy to be cheaper in price. Yet Earls was determined to write these novellas \u2013 even if that meant changing industry attitudes in the process. He hopes readers will stop seeing the novella as an \u201cin-betweener\u201d rather the ideal reading experience for today\u2019s time-poor readers. He was encouraged by the book industry\u2019s ongoing migration into the digital space and its comparatively cheaper overheads. \u201cIn the 21st century, the game has surely changed,\u201d he says. \u201cAn ebook can be whatever size it needs to be, and you price it as you choose to price it.\u201d In fact, the first-ever mass-market ebook was a novella: 2000\u2019s Riding the Bullet by Stephen King. It was a happy milestone after King\u2019s long struggle to see his novellas published; in his 1982 collection of four novellas, Different Seasons, one of which was adapted into the Academy award-nominated film The Shawshank Redemption, he called the form \u201can anarchy-ridden literary banana republic\u201d. The digital revolution smoothed the way for King to write and publish more novellas, and he has been joined by a host of big-name authors, including Patricia Cornwell and John Grisham, who have released Kindle Singles. The format was launched by Amazon\u2019s Kindle in 2011 and is described as \u201ccompelling ideas expressed at their natural length\u201d \u2013 typically essays, short stories and novellas between 5,000 and 30,000 words. Sometimes they are used by novelists to release nimble spin-offs from their existing fictional worlds. For Earls, writing Wisdom Tree was a way to swiftly explore how men grapple with early 21st century life through five standalone stories, each featuring an Australian male protagonist of different ages. \u201cEach looks at what we value, and at the things that are pitched to us by society to value like fame, celebrity. But at the same time this story has another current flowing deeper, looking at the things that actually matter in people\u2019s lives,\u201d he says. So we have Gotham, an encounter between a music journalist and the young rapper he is interviewing called Na$ti Boi; Venice, about love and the tensions that pull us apart; Vancouver, featuring one man and \u201cthe giant that influenced his life\u201d; Juneau, set in a former Alaskan gold-rush town; and NoHo, featuring Charlie and his would-be-star sister, Cassie, in Hollywood. Earls says audio books have also been affected by the digital revolution. \u201cInstead of being a $70 box of cassette tapes that were pretty cumbersome, they\u2019re now something you can play on a device that just about every one of us carries around in our pocket or our bag.\u201d He has been closely watching the rise of podcasting, too. Blockbuster podcast Serial, for instance, is the radio equivalent of \u201cnatural-length\u201d publishing, with episodes that vary between 30 minutes to over an hour long. \u201cThere really doesn\u2019t need to be any size rules.\u201d When I suggest that we may soon see the end of even defining whether a work is a short story, novella or novel, Earls says for writers the distinction can still be meaningful. When writing a short story \u201cyou\u2019ve got that one piece of business, and you\u2019re not supposed to mess around in doing it\u201d; both novels and novellas are more complex affair with multiple plot lines. It is important for writers to start with a vision of the size and scope of a piece, Earls says. He is excited about the staggered release of his five novellas, which he says \u201cdoes justice to what they are\u201d rather than if they were bound as a single volume. \u201cIt actually gives people small books that says if you\u2019ve got two to three hours to read, here\u2019s something that\u2019s for you. And there\u2019s no compromise on quality, it\u2019s just shorter than a novel.\u201d Gotham is the first novella from Wisdom Tree by Nick Earls and is available as an audio book for free for a limited time on Audible, and as a digital book or in paperback",

      "bodyText": "New South Wales continues to be Australia\u2019s strongest-performing economy while continued high unemployment has seen Western Australia slip again into sixth position, according to the latest CommSec State of the States report released on Monday. But the report says there is little difference between the top two states and between the bottom three. Victoria has gained \u201csubstantial ground\u201d on NSW with strong housing finance, population growth, and the fastest annual economic growth rate in the nation. At the other end of the scale, the Tasmanian economy has improved enough to draw equal-last with South Australia after a modest lift in momentum driven by the low Australian dollar. The Tasmanian treasurer, Peter Gutwein, told Hobart paper the Mercury that he welcomed the slight improvement but there was still \u201ca lot of work to do\u201d. Western Australia, which had the strongest-performing economy in the October 2014 report, remains second-highest on construction work but second-lowest in business investment, population growth and housing finance. Population growth in particular has taken a dive: the end of the mining boom has seen it drop to 1.27%, down more than 50% on the decade average. The end of the boom has also seen WA ranked worst performer in terms of unemployment. The unemployment rate is 5.7% in trend terms, up from a decade-average of 4.4%. However, the report notes that at least part of WA\u2019s low rank could be due to a change in the data used to measure economic growth, which is now measured just on state final demand figures. \u201cNo doubt if exports and imports were considered, Western Australia would have been among the strongest-growing economies rather than in fifth place (for economic growth),\u201d the report notes. The State of the States report, released quarterly, rates states and territories across eight key measures: economic growth; retail spending; equipment investment; unemployment; construction work; population growth; housing finance; and dwelling starts. The Australian Capital Territory was in third place, driven by a 21.1% increase in equipment investment in the past 12 months and strong annual population growth. The Northern Territory ranked fourth, despite continuing to lead the economic growth and construction work indicators, due to placing last in population growth, business investment and housing finance. Queensland, which had the lowest national ranking on construction work and second-lowest on economic growth, ranked fifth. \u201cThe end of the construction phase of the mining boom is clearly evident in Western Australia and Queensland,\u201d CommSec chief economist Craig James told AAP.",

      "bodyText": "The peak body for internet users has thrown its weight behind calls to end geoblocking, as increasing use of legal video-on-demand services is revealed by new figures. The Productivity Commission\u2019s recommendation that the federal government oppose the restriction of online content by territory in an effort to rebalance Australia\u2019s intellectual property system was met with widespread support on Friday. The commission found most illegal piracy was driven by frustration with legal alternatives, or the absence thereof. The chief executive of Internet Australia, Laurie Patton, said, if circumventing geoblocking through virtual private networks and other workarounds were permitted, local outlets would be put under greater pressure to secure rights to popular content. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that some people will go to great lengths to find what they want to watch if it\u2019s not readily available via the traditional media outlets,\u201d he said, echoing calls made last week by the consumer advocacy group Choice. \u201cHowever, the evidence suggests most people are happy to pay if the content they\u2019re after is readily available at what they feel is a reasonable cost. \u201cWe have consistently argued that geoblocking is fundamentally wrong and that it has resulted in unfair price-gouging of Australian consumers for decades.\u201d The commission\u2019s findings prompted Internet Australia to renew its call for a repeal of the so-called \u201csite-blocking law\u201d, the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement ) Act 2015 \u2013 introduced by then-communications minister Malcolm Turnbull and passed by parliament in June. It gave rights holders, such as television and movie producers, the ability to apply to the federal court to have foreign piracy-related websites blocked by Australian internet service providers (ISPs). It was opposed by the Greens and Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm. But Patton said it was an ineffective means of targeting unlawful downloading, with content reappearing on different sites or under new names after being blocked. \u201cIt\u2019s called whack-a-mole,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, anyone with a modicum of technical knowledge can always find a way to access what they want, lawfully or unlawfully. \u201cSo we are going to inconvenience ISPs, and probably see everyone\u2019s internet access fees increase as a consequence ... all for a bit of PR?\u201d Patton said piracy would be best combated by making content available, easily accessible and reasonably priced. \u201cIt would be in the best interests of content creators if we all accepted that the main reason why most people unlawfully download is that they can\u2019t get what they want through legitimate channels.\u201d It echoes comments made by Turnbull in July last year, that the \u201cmost powerful tool to combat online copyright infringement is making content accessible, timely, and affordable to consumers\u201d. Netflix\u2019s launch in Australia in March last year was linked to a drop in piracy \u2013 but its catalogue is still smaller than what it offers in the United States. It has been contacted for comment. Netflix and two local services, Presto and Stan, were mentioned in Nielsen\u2019s latest findings on an \u201cexplosion\u201d in video on demand in Australia. Research released on Monday said more than two-thirds of online Australians aged 16 and over would be watching video on demand by the end of this year \u2013 an increase of 4% from last year. Though traditional television remains dominant, more choice and more timely and exclusive content was driving a \u201creal interest in trialling and subscribing\u201d to such services. Lillian Zrim of Nielsen said more than a quarter of the online population was expected to have access to Netflix \u2013 either through a trial or paid subscription \u2013 by the end of the year, an 11% year on year increase. It also forecasted Stan would increase by 8% to reach 11% of the online population.",

      "bodyText": "\u2018I brought this on us\u2019 Every week, Fear the Walking Dead takes more and more from the original recipe of The Walking Dead. In this episode, a group infiltrates and attacks our floating headquarters, and a \u201cstrong\u201d leader who\u2019s not afraid of violence teaches a few of the supposed good guys a couple of lessons about morality in the new world. This was the Governor storyline of season three, and the Negan storyline of the parent season\u2019s most recent run. Don\u2019t we want the spin-off to be different? No one\u2019s asking to remove the zombie guts from the engine, but Fear\u2019s biggest problem was always going to be how it stood out. So far, its focus on family hasn\u2019t been enough. We can blame Alicia for the attack on the Abigail, what with her overly trusting conversation with Jack on the radio back in the season premiere. The attackers use a ruse about a pregnant woman in need, and it\u2019s not long before Jack, Reed and Vita have taken everyone hostage and Strand adrift on a raft. Talk immediately turns to the mysterious leader, Connor \u2026 justas minions of the original series would talk about the Governor or Negan before viewers got a glimpse. Alicia, vying for the title of The Worst this week, seems more concerned that she was lied to about Jack\u2019s dead girlfriend than anything else. Predictably, she convinces Jack to ensure her family\u2019s safety in exchange for her going with them. Meanwhile, Travis convinces Reed that he can start the boat, and by smuggling a knife from the machine room furthers his plot to free the hostages. When Connor arrives with reinforcements, he says he\u2019ll take Alicia and Travis only \u2013 kind of a surprise, since everyone talked about the need for people who can handle themselves, and Alicia and Travis do not pass that bar. Even Chris has proven himself handier in a pinch. It\u2019s like a pro football team using their first two picks in the draft on a garden gnome and a golden retriever. \u2018The rest of the world has fallen away\u2019 When this episode didn\u2019t feel like The Walking Dead, it felt like Lost, full of flashbacks about Strand\u2019s story. That the character turns out to be gay was a pleasant surprise, if quickly obvious, thanks to the body language in a bar. There are a few gay people in the franchise, but as a fellow friend of Dorothy, I\u2019m glad such a complicated and central figure is in love with a man. And the Abigail turns out not to be named for a woman, but rather Thomas Abigail, a millionaire and Strand\u2019s significant other, whom he met in a hotel bar after losing his fortune in Hurricane Katrina. Strand stole from Abigail, but used that to create a new fortune, and is now on a quest to reunite with him at their immaculate, splendid hideaway in Mexico \u2013 at least until the zombies get them. But all this character development also revealed that Strand wasn\u2019t about to die, not yet, and not in a deflated raft. It also gave the show a needed boost: Strand became a more compelling character, and one to root for outside the central family. \u2018Death is a way to new life\u2019 While the episode\u2019s major plots were the hijacking and Strand\u2019s past, it began with Nick washing ashore naked and his wander through an eerie tent village. He again tricks the undead by masking his scent with zombie guts, but did he have to use so much? Wouldn\u2019t just a dollop on his clothes suffice? He had gone to meet Luis, Strand\u2019s de facto brother-in-law waiting for a pickup at a development in southern California. He\u2019s the contact to get everyone across the border, though the coyote plan also raises a question: why not just sail around it? At ant rate, he meets Luis\u2019 mother Celia, who claims her sons are a force to be reckoned with and that she and Thomas are waiting for Strand. That the extended Manawa-Salazar clan is along for the ride is a surprise to all parties, but the episode\u2019s subsequent plot points should not surprise viewers. Madison shanks Reed with the weapon Travis left behind, Chris is increasingly aggressive \u2013 though apparently a bit smarter than before \u2013 and the hijackers are routed. Too bad they didn\u2019t get there before Connor ran off with Travis and Alicia somewhere \u2013 one can only hope it\u2019s a Waterworld flotilla, Kevin Costner and all. And though the episode was formulaic, it at least set up a new path for Alicia and Travis, and turned Mexico into a more interesting land than just the vague destination for our floating family.",

Wouldn\u2019t just a dollop on his clothes suffice?</p> <p>He had gone to meet Luis, Strand\u2019s de facto brother-in-law waiting for a pickup at a development in southern California. He\u2019s the contact to get everyone across the border, though the coyote plan also raises a question: why not just sail around it?</p> <p>At ant rate, he meets Luis\u2019 mother Celia, who claims her sons are a force to be reckoned with and that she and Thomas are waiting for Strand. That the extended Manawa-Salazar clan is along for the ride is a surprise to all parties, but the episode\u2019s subsequent plot points should not surprise viewers. Madison shanks Reed with the weapon Travis left behind, Chris is increasingly aggressive \u2013 though apparently a bit smarter than before \u2013 and the hijackers are routed.</p> <p>Too bad they didn\u2019t get there before Connor ran off with Travis and Alicia somewhere \u2013 one can only hope it\u2019s a Waterworld flotilla, Kevin Costner and all. And though the episode was formulaic, it at least set up a new path for Alicia and Travis, and turned Mexico into a more interesting land than just the vague destination for our floating family.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tennessee Williams\u2019 play has travelled a rather more circular route in Benedict Andrews\u2019 new staging, which is flashy, canny, poignant, and imported from the Young Vic in London to St Ann\u2019s Warehouse. The apartment of Stanley and Stella Kowalski, where the wrung-out belle Blanche DuBois arrives, is set atop a carousel that revolves, both slowly and quickly, as the play rattles to its devastating conclusion. The spare, Ikea-showroom furnishings and the gyrating set are the most obvious attempts to update the script (the adolescent choice to blare loud rock music between the scene changes is less successful one), but what\u2019s remarkable in Andrews\u2019s production is how current and often vital the material feels. Replace a reference to Huey Long with one to Donald Trump, and this study of femininity, masculinity, sexuality, and illusion feels like it might have been written today. Like Ivo van Hove, whose work Andrews\u2019 somewhat resembles, the director has excavated the text to find what is most essential and urgent beneath it. Gillian Anderson arrives at Elysian Fields in New Orleans looking like a Hitchcock blonde, with terrible desperation just beneath that froideur. She\u2019s horrified by the smallness and meanness of the apartment that her sister, Stella (Vanessa Kirby), shares with her husband, the ex-serviceman Stanley (Ben Foster), and by the flimsy curtain separating their bed from hers. This cues a tug-of-war for Stella\u2019s sympathies. Anderson\u2019s Blanche is the craftier, more manipulative player, but Foster\u2019s lunkish Stanley has his muscles and his sexual prowess, advantages he will use to terrible effect at the play\u2019s climax. Anderson, best known in the US for the The X-Files, is a haunting Blanche, imperious and frail, vicious and injured. She knows the words that will hurt Stanley most, largely because he senses the truth of them, and her flirtation is another way to taunt him. If Foster, who has taken Blanche\u2019s comments about Stanley\u2019s bestiality to heart, lacks the grace and the more obvious sensuality of some interpretations of the character, he inhabits Stanley\u2019s erotic fascination and violent temper without apology or ostentation. Andrews builds his production around their climactic confrontations, but some of the quieter moments register most strongly, as in a sequence when the minor characters clamber onstage to tidy the mess Blanche and Stanley have made. This sequence \u2013 part dance, part chore, part ritual \u2013 silently conveys the community\u2019s complicity in rewarding Stanley\u2019s aggressive masculinity and condemning Blanche\u2019s more unnerving sexuality. That carousel keeps turning into the final scenes. Where once it might have suggested the play\u2019s shifting sympathies and the character\u2019s patterns of dominance and submission, its circling finally comes to suggest the tragic inevitability of the play\u2019s end.",

      "bodyText": "Economic credentials and policy will dominate the upcoming election campaign. Be it jobs and growth, tax, government spending, business investment, house prices and negative gearing, most key issues will have a strong economic content. Unfortunately, most of the debate is based on perceptions which are framed around mistruths and distortions about economic issues. What makes this a problem for voters is that when politicians distort the facts, make things up or outright lie, they are seldom if ever held to account by the interviewer. This showed when treasurer Scott Morrison recently called for more investment \u201cand that needs to come from the private sector\u201d, adding that \u201cprivate investment is always how Australia has succeeded and will continue to succeed\u201d. He bagged the Labor party \u201cspend and tax\u201d policies that would damage the economy if they won the election. Morrison is correct on the need for private sector investment, but it is a truism in much the same way as saying job creation is good and high unemployment is bad. Morrison\u2019s comments and platitudes say nothing about the track record of the current government or the policy required to deliver stronger investment. Unfortunately for Morrison, the track record of the Coalition on private sector investment is horrible. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics private capital expenditure data, investment has fallen 23% since the Coalition\u2019s 2013 victory. This is the sort of data usually seen in nasty recessions. The investment expectations data for next financial year are for additional falls of around 10%. If a record of strong private business investment is a success as Morrison claims, presumably he would rate the track record of the Liberal government as a dismal failure. What is even more embarrassing for Morrison is that under the previous Labor government from 2007 to 2013, there was a 67% increase in private business investment. In terms of jobs and growth, the ABS data shows that average quarterly GDP growth and average monthly increases in employment are stronger when Labor has been in government compared with the Coalition. I recently analysed the rates of GDP and employment growth under Labor and Liberal governments. The data were based on the 43-year period since December 1972 when the Labor Whitlam government was elected. This meant, quite neatly, that there was around 21 and a half years of data for Labor governments and around the same for Liberal governments. There has been a little more data released since that article was finalised but the end point remains \u2013 GDP and employment growth both rise at a faster pace when the Labor is in government. Average annual GDP growth is around $1.7bn higher a year in today\u2019s dollar terms and employment growth is around 25,000 people a year stronger with Labor at the helm. In terms of jobs, in the 2013 election campaign, the Coalition promised to deliver 1m jobs over five years based on its plans to abolish the mining tax, carbon pricing and reduction of red tape. With 30 months of data available since the September 2013 election, the Coalition is falling well short of its 1m jobs target. Employment has so far risen by 441,900 and with the economy muddling along, the rate of jobs growth will be lucky to reach 900,000. Under the previous Labor government, from December 2007 to September 2013, the unemployment rate averaged 5.1% and it did not exceed 5.9%. Under the current government, the unemployment rate has averaged 6% and only in the last two months has is edged below. Labor achieved this with a global recession while in the last few years, the world has registered steady if not spectacular growth. The economic facts would suggest that the Turnbull government has a flimsy track record to take to the election campaign even though it will claim it is better at running the economy. It will be essential that Labor asserts its success at managing the economy and if it can do this, it might have a chance at making the election a close run race.

According to an ABC report before his appearance on Four Corners on Monday, Alexander said negative gearing had led to a housing market \u201cdominated by speculative investors\u201d. \u201cToo often we see the young couple getting beaten out at the auction and then renting out the very place that they were trying to buy,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst home buyers have really been unable to compete.\u201d Alexander headed a parliamentary inquiry into housing affordability, which is due to report this year.

Elena Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan series \u2013 the author considers it a single work in four parts \u2013 is rare in being both acclaimed literature and a sales phenomenon. Since the first part was published in 2012 (book four in 2015) the tetralogy has sold over a million copies worldwide. As a comparison, David Foster Wallace\u2019s famous Infinite Jest from 1996 has only now achieved similar sales after 20 years. (Foster Wallace\u2019s opus weighs in at 1,080 pages, Ferrante\u2019s at 1,700 pages.) Much of the intrigue about the supposedly autobiographical fiction arises from the author steadfastly remaining anonymous, as if in rebuke to our celebrity-crazed culture. Compounding this refusal of publicity, the remarkable sales have been achieved despite controversial, unloved covers. (Amazing sales despite problematic covers proves a point deflationary to designers\u2019 egos.) Quartz magazine asked, \u201cWhy does this brilliant, bestselling book have such a cheesy cover?\u201d Another headline: \u201cThis bestselling book has a terrible cover. Here\u2019s why.\u201d For the TLS reviewer the covers suggested \u201cbland escapism.\u201d The UK Spectator took the trouble to note that the cover of book four \u201cfeatures a dreadful illustration of two little girls dressed like fairies.\u201d In Park Slope, Brooklyn \u2013 ultimate hipsterville \u2013 a Ferrante-enthusiast bookseller described them as \u201cforgive me \u2013 \u2018chick-lit\u2019 covers.\u201d Discussing the original design of book one, My Brilliant Friend, the Italian publisher, Sandra Ozzola of Europa Editions, explained: [the novel] would conclude with a scene of a very vulgar Neapolitan wedding ... an extremely important moment ... That\u2019s why I intentionally searched for a photo that was \u201ckitsch\u201d \u2026 vulgarity is an important aspect of the books, of all that Elena (the narrator) wants to distance herself from. Ozzola then said they \u201chad the feeling that many people didn\u2019t understand the game we were playing \u2026 dressing an extremely refined story with a touch of vulgarity.\u201d A cover featuring a wedding of kitschy vulgarity could, if the viewer was primed, be read as an ironic response to the narrator\u2019s personal discomfort \u2013 but, as we all know from bitter experience, irony can be notoriously hard to convey. To ensure an ironic reading, you would have to embed a winking emoji into the image. Design critic Steve Heller says, \u201cthese things look like Hallmark cards or bad romance novels. They\u2019re not vulgar enough.\u201d A contrarian reading proclaims that the covers are \u201cno joke\u201d. Because \u201cdismissing the covers for looking like the covers of Christian self-help books (they do!) or Nicholas Sparks novels (this too!) also dismisses the types of women who might purchase and read those kinds of books.\u201d Which is simply perverse or reverse snobbery. One might as well say that the covers actually dismiss the types of women who revile self-help books and Nicholas Sparks novels, or indeed, the books\u2019 narrator herself. Everyone initially involved in the Australian edition of My Brilliant Friend \u2013 publisher, editor, marketing and publicity \u2013 was of one mind about the original Italian cover: \u201cno\u201d\u2019 This was a couple of years before the spread of #FerranteFever. My design opinion was required, so I read the book. Here is what stood out to me a few pages into the opening chapter: \u201cWe lived in a world in which children and adults were often wounded, blood flowed from the wounds, they festered, and sometimes people died.\u201d This was followed by a vivid list: One \u2026 had stepped on a nail and died of tetanus \u2026 that night was dead, crushed, the blood pouring out of his ears and mouth \u2026 killed because he fell from scaffolding \u2026 missing an arm, the lathe had caught him unawares ... The narrator maintains that brutally unsentimental tone unabated to the concluding wedding scene: The plebeians were us. The plebeians were that fight for food and wine, that quarrel over who should be served first and better. You had to read the book to discover that the original cover was truly ironic. Deciding to make new un-ironic covers meant that Australia is the only Anglophone country with a different set of designs. Instead of kitschy soap opera, my design was guided by Italian art films \u2013 the cinematic, emotional appeal of Visconti, Fellini and Bertolucci. The typography was created in homage to the commercial signage of mid-century Italy. In our version, vulgarity was replaced with a sophisticated aesthetic, one that we thought far more likely to attract the readership for \u201can extremely refined story.\u201d Part of the narrative charge comes from the understanding that the narrator is an autofictional character \u2013 Elena Greco, like her creator Elena Ferrante, is also an author, and they seem to be writing each other\u2019s story. For the cover of the final book, The Story of the Lost Child, I chose an image one could construe as a frank depiction of the narrator, Elena aka Len\u00f9. And so by the logic of the metafictional frame and the vacuum pressure of the author\u2019s insistent absence, it becomes a surreptitious imaginary portrait of Elena Ferrante herself.",

      "bodyText": "The western obsession with rights makes it difficult to see their limitations. We speak about rights as if they were the only moral value with meaning, ignoring other important moral values like responsibilities or duties. In fact, responsibilities are the counterparts to rights \u2013 you can\u2019t have one without the other. Philosopher Carl Cohen writes that, \u201cIf animals have any rights, they must have the right not to be killed to advance the interest of others.\u201d Another way of putting this is that those who assert the rights of animals are in effect asserting \u2013 first and foremost \u2013 a right to life for all animals. But for an animal to realise its right to life, farmers, hunters and researchers must collectively accept a duty not to kill them. Similarly, citizens, consumers and patients must refuse to eat, wear or use food, clothes and medicine that require an animal to die. As I\u2019ll be arguing in the IQ2 debate \u201cAnimal rights should trump human interests\u201d in Sydney on Tuesday night, the assertion of an animal right to life is non-sensical. It would require us \u2013 just as one example \u2013 to stop animals from hunting one another, just like we stop humans from killing one another. But more importantly, it is unnecessary to achieve what is required to improve the lot of animals. Even Peter Singer, one of the intellectual fathers of the animal rights movement, doesn\u2019t believe animals have a right to life. In his seminal text Animal Liberation he says we must refuse to contribute to \u2013 and act to stop \u2013 the unnecessary suffering of animals. But he does not contend that animals have a right to life or that they suffer by having their life taken from them. Instead, what he claims is that intensively farmed animals suffer because of the cruel and tortuous ways they are made to live and are slaughtered. We have a duty to do what we can to stop this by boycotting businesses that treat animals cruelly. Having done that, we have a choice. We can go without wearing make-up and without eating or wearing animal flesh that required the torture of animals, or we can source and buy cruelty-free cosmetics and eat and wear ethically-farmed and slaughtered animal products. In other words, while it might have been true that when Animal Liberation was written in the 1970s, the result of a boycott was a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle, this is no longer the case. Today, there is more than one way to fulfil our obligations to eliminate the unnecessary suffering of animals. Indeed, given clear, cross-cultural evidence that only around 1.5% of people are willing to try or stick with a vegan or vegetarian lifestyle \u2013 figures that have not changed over time \u2013 the promotion of an ethically carnivorous life is likely to be a far more effective way to reduce the suffering of animals. To me, this is so obvious that I have to ask why in 2016 animal rights groups continue to advance vegetarian and veganism as the only legitimate way to end animal suffering. A 2014 study funded by Voiceless, found that 70% of Australians agreed that \u201chuman beings have an obligation to avoid harming all animals\u201d. This sort of sentiment had led \u201csubstantial proportions\u201d to buy \u201cfree range\u201d meat and dairy and cruelty-free products. Despite this, the Humane Research Council \u2013 authors of the study \u2013 advised animal rights advocates that while they ought capitalise on \u201cwidespread support for incremental improvements\u201d they must also continue to press people to \u201cabstain from animal products entirely.\u201d Why not press people who have chosen to make a difference through buying cruelty-free products to buy more of them more often? Or to buy them exclusively? Is it possible that vegetarianism and veganism continues to be promoted as the sole way of meeting our obligations to animals not because it is, but because it makes the promoters feel morally superior? If it were, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time the eco-left stymied mass behaviour change with unpalatable prescriptions delivered in self-righteous tones. Analysis has revealed that mass communications around climate change provoked feelings of powerlessness rather than a desire to act in many people. Often the wrong moral note was struck, too. Environmental activist and philosopher Sarah Bachelard wrote at the time, \u201cThere can be a tone of self-righteousness ... a kind of shrill moral indignation ... We know that we are on the side of the angels, and in our own way we can fail to do justice to the complex reality of most human action and motivation. We get something out of \u2018being right\u2019 ...

We speak about rights as if they were the only moral value with meaning, ignoring other important moral values like responsibilities or duties. In fact, responsibilities are the counterparts to rights \u2013 you can\u2019t have one without the other. </p> <p>Philosopher Carl Cohen writes that, \u201cIf animals have any rights, they must have <a href=\"http://carl-cohen.org/books/AnimalRightsDebate/chapter4.pdf\">the right not to be killed</a> to advance the interest of others.\u201d Another way of putting this is that those who assert the rights of animals are in effect asserting \u2013 first and foremost \u2013 a right to life for all animals.</p> <p>But for an animal to realise its right to life, farmers, hunters and researchers must collectively accept a duty not to kill them. Similarly, citizens, consumers and patients must refuse to eat, wear or use food, clothes and medicine that require an animal to die.</p> <p>As I\u2019ll be arguing in the IQ2 debate \u201c<a href=\"http://www.ethics.org.au/Events/Event-details/IQ2-Debate-Animal-Rights-Should-Trump-Human-Intere\">Animal rights should trump human interests</a>\u201d in Sydney on Tuesday night, the assertion of an animal right to life is non-sensical. It would require us \u2013 just as one example \u2013 to stop animals from hunting one another, just like we stop humans from killing one another. But more importantly, it is unnecessary to achieve what is required to improve the lot of animals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/29/should-i-go-vegan-lucy-siegle\">Is being vegan the most ethical way to live? | Lucy Siegle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even Peter Singer, one of the intellectual fathers of the animal rights movement, doesn\u2019t believe animals have a right to life. In his seminal text Animal Liberation he says we must refuse to contribute to \u2013 and act to stop \u2013 the unnecessary suffering of animals.</p> <p>But he does not contend that animals have a right to life or that they suffer by having their life taken from them.</p> <p>Instead, what he claims is that intensively farmed animals suffer because of the cruel and tortuous ways they are made to live and are slaughtered. We have a duty to do what we can to stop this by boycotting businesses that treat animals cruelly.</p> <p>Having done that, we have a choice. We can go without wearing make-up and without eating or wearing animal flesh that required the torture of animals, or we can source and buy cruelty-free cosmetics and eat and wear ethically-farmed and slaughtered animal products.</p> <p>In other words, while it might have been true that when Animal Liberation was written in the 1970s, the result of a boycott was a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle, this is no longer the case. Today, there is more than one way to fulfil our obligations to eliminate the unnecessary suffering of animals.</p> <p>Indeed, given clear, cross-cultural evidence that only around 1.5% of people are willing to try or stick with a vegan or vegetarian lifestyle \u2013 figures that have not changed over time \u2013 the promotion of an ethically carnivorous life is likely to be a far more effective way to reduce the suffering of animals.</p> <p>To me, this is so obvious that I have to ask why in 2016 animal rights groups continue to advance vegetarian and veganism as the only legitimate way to end animal suffering. A<a href=\"https://www.voiceless.org.au/content/animal-tracker-australia-0\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.voiceless.org.au/content/animal-tracker-australia-0\">2014 study</a> funded by Voiceless, found that 70% of Australians agreed that \u201chuman beings have an obligation to avoid harming all animals\u201d. This sort of sentiment had led \u201csubstantial proportions\u201d to buy \u201cfree range\u201d meat and dairy and cruelty-free products. Despite this, the Humane Research Council \u2013 authors of the study \u2013 advised animal rights advocates that while they ought capitalise on \u201cwidespread support for incremental improvements\u201d they must also continue to press people to \u201cabstain from animal products entirely.\u201d</p> <p>Why not press people who have chosen to make a difference through buying cruelty-free products to buy more of them more often? Or to buy them exclusively? Is it possible that vegetarianism and veganism continues to be promoted as the sole way of meeting our obligations to animals not because it is, but because it makes the promoters feel morally superior?</p> <p>If it were, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time the eco-left stymied mass behaviour change with unpalatable prescriptions delivered in self-righteous tones.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/03/being-a-little-bit-vegan-is-completely-oxymoronic\">You can't be 'a little bit vegan'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Analysis has revealed that mass communications around climate change provoked feelings of powerlessness rather than a desire to act in many people.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a site that supporters say should be spoken of \u201cin the same breath as the Wave Hill walk-off\u201d, a 300-hectare tract of city-adjacent coastal land, which holds a central role in the history of Indigenous land rights. On Friday, a bitter dispute over attempts to heritage list the Kulaluk lease, less than 20km from the Darwin city centre, seemed to be decided as the Northern Territory planning minister, Dave Tollner, rejected a recommendation by the Heritage Council to list it. Had Kulaluk received heritage listing it would have been the first Aboriginal site to do so in Darwin. Kululuk has been the subject of heated conflict among its traditional owners and affected Indigenous residents, divided over moves to develop a retail precinct and medical centre on the site. In 1979 after years of sometimes violent protests \u2013 including sit-ins across the main arterial road in Darwin, a symbolic flag-raising at the Darwin courthouse claiming the land as Aboriginal, and the firebombing of construction equipment in the 1960s and 70s \u2013 a special purpose lease in perpetuity over Kulaluk was granted to the Gwalwa Daraniki Association. It was the first land title handed back to its traditional owners within a capital city. In recent years part of the Kulaluk block was rezoned to host a McDonald\u2019s restaurant, chemist, and services station. Gwalwa Daraniki had sought to rezone further tracts, with plans floated for businesses, a place of worship, a restaurant and a club among the ideas cited, but came up against opposition from some Larrakia and Danggalaba Kulumbirigin people. In September Gwalwa Daraniki signed a memorandum of understanding with the NT government to develop the land, and approvals are already in place for a medical centre and retail precinct. It was hoped the money raised by the developments would go towards maintaining and building houses on two Aboriginal town camps \u2013 Kulaluk and Minmarama \u2013 and building a new community centre and aged care facility. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep asking for welfare dependency from the government to look after our communities,\u201d Helen Secretary, whose family controls Gwalwa Daraniki, told the ABC last year. \u201cAnd Aboriginal people and Aboriginal organisations, we\u2019ve got land that we can use.\u201d She said the decision gave the community a say in what would happen to its land, and would create jobs and opportunities for their kids. However the Larrakia Nation Aboriginal corporation disagreed with the easy development, and sought to have the area classified as heritage in order to put in stronger safeguards for any future projects. Donna Jackson, a Larrakia woman and representative of the Larrakia Nation Aboriginal corporation said there should be enough money coming in through rents from houses and existing developments. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just about the money stuff, it\u2019s about protecting the land as the elders wanted it protected,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey never said we can\u2019t develop it or use it for anyone else but they wanted it protected and managed by us in an appropriate way. \u201cThere are burial sites, ceremonial ground where elders came from around the territory to sit with our elders and talk about the overall land rights struggle. There were Gurindji elders involved from the Wave Hill walk-off. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just Larrakia values we\u2019re concerned about there. There are other groups who have had a long association with that land.\u201d Burial sites belonging to Tiwi Islanders were among the mix, laid after battles between the clans on nearby beaches, Jackson said. While they had \u201canecdotal and eye-witness accounts\u201d of seeing Pukumani burial poles \u2013 part of Tiwi ceremonial rites \u2013 in one area in particular, Larrakia Nation couldn\u2019t prove it and failed to get the site protected. Jackson also pointed to the natural heritage value of the area, which includes large areas of mangroves and mudflats which were home to migratory birds and other species. The NT Heritage Council, which is thought to have received more than 200 submissions on the heritage nomination, deliberated and decided in favour of listing it two weeks ago. However on Friday afternoon Tollner dismissed the council\u2019s recommendation, declaring no part of the land would be listed, in order to allow the Gwalwa Daraniki Association to secure its economic future. \u201cThe most effective way we can honour the importance of this lease is by allowing the GDA to determine how their lands will be developed,\u201d said Tollner. \u201cA heritage listing would prevent future development and would not protect any historical association with the Aboriginal land rights movement.\u201d Members of the Larrakia Nation Aboriginal Corporation were \u201cdevastated\u201d, according to their legal representative and head of the NT environmental defenders office, David Morris. He said his clients learned of the decision through a media release, which demonstrated \u201ca gross insensitivity on the minister\u2019s behalf\u201d. Morris said the history of Kululuk \u201cshould be spoken of in the same breathe as the Wave Hill walk-off\u201d. In 1966 a group of Aboriginal workers in Wave Hill, led by Vincent Lingiari, walked off a cattle station in central Northern Territory on strike against poor pay conditions and called for the return of their land. Nine years later then prime minister, Gough Whitlam, symbolically handed soil to Lingiari, as their land rights were returned. The Larrakia\u2019s fight for Kulaluk, led by Bobby Secretary, was just as central to Indigenous land rights as that first battle by the Gurindji, Morris said. \u201c[Tollner\u2019s decision] is a disgraceful act which doesn\u2019t recognise the enormous importance of the land to the Larrakia people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of profound importance to my clients and \u2013 judging by the number of submissions \u2013 it\u2019s also of huge community and public importance.\u201d An independent review into the heritage significance of Kulaluk, commissioned by the Lands Planning and Mining Tribunal, found the site had implicit significance to the wider community (pdf), because of its connection to historic events and people. \u201cThe dramatic way in which the Kulaluk claim was first prosecuted, in particular the creation of the Larrakia flag and the symbolic raising of that flag over the supreme court in the Northern Territory brought the Larrakia claim to national attention and is now an iconic part of our history,\u201d it said. A number of large-scale development proposals were relying on Tollner\u2019s decision. They may have faced complicated rezoning applications if it had been granted heritage listing, Guardian Australia understands. Most of the lease area would remain as conservation land, Tollner said, and any development would have to comply with conservation law. Aboriginal graves and sacred sites remained protected, he said, but Jackson noted this only referred to the ones already listed. The Heritage Council was unable to reveal its recommendation before the minister announced it. However the chairman, Wayne Kraft, earlier told Guardian Australia it was a \u201crigorous and open contest\u201d and he ensured all his council members were \u201cfully briefed\u201d. \u201cSometimes people forget to pass on information, but I was paranoid to make sure all the history was right, and the process of the nomination which had been fraught with procedural incorrections,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve nailed that, we\u2019ve since got a new council, and I\u2019m confident as chair that the process has been totally open and transparent under the act.\u201d Kraft said there was a lot of passion for the land, both for and against heritage listing. Tollner had the option of accepting the council\u2019s recommendation, requesting more information or a variation in it, or rejecting it. Speaking after the council made its decision but before he had seen it, Tollner told Guardian Australia \u201cwe\u2019re not in the business of heritage listing town camps\u201d. \u201cWhen you see important pieces of historic infrastructure and relics that are worth preserving, we certainly look at doing what we can to preserve those features but when it comes to town camps I\u2019m not of the view that we want to protect that.\u201d",

Nine years later then prime minister, Gough Whitlam, symbolically handed soil to Lingiari, as their land rights were returned. </p> <p>The Larrakia\u2019s fight for Kulaluk, led by Bobby Secretary, was just as central to Indigenous land rights as that first battle by the Gurindji, Morris said.</p> <p>\u201c[Tollner\u2019s decision] is a disgraceful act which doesn\u2019t recognise the enormous importance of the land to the Larrakia people,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of profound importance to my clients and \u2013 judging by the number of submissions \u2013 it\u2019s also of huge community and public importance.\u201d</p> <p>An independent review into the heritage significance of Kulaluk, commissioned by the Lands Planning and Mining Tribunal, <a href=\"http://planinc.org.au/images/documents/kulaluk/Kulaluk-David-Ritchie-Final-Report-to-Heritage-Council.pdf\">found the site had implicit significance to the wider community</a> (pdf), because of its connection to historic events and people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When it comes to town camps I\u2019m not of the view that we want to protect that</p> <footer> <cite>Dave Tollner</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe dramatic way in which the Kulaluk claim was first prosecuted, in particular the creation of the Larrakia flag and the symbolic raising of that flag over the supreme court in the Northern Territory brought the Larrakia claim to national attention and is now an iconic part of our history,\u201d it said.</p> <p>A number of large-scale development proposals were relying on Tollner\u2019s decision. They may have faced complicated rezoning applications if it had been granted heritage listing, Guardian Australia understands.<br /></p> <p>Most of the lease area would remain as conservation land, Tollner said, and any development would have to comply with conservation law.</p> <p>Aboriginal graves and sacred sites remained protected, he said, but Jackson noted this only referred to the ones already listed.</p> <p>The Heritage Council was unable to reveal its recommendation before the minister announced it. However the chairman, Wayne Kraft, earlier told Guardian Australia it was a \u201crigorous and open contest\u201d and he ensured all his council members were \u201cfully briefed\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes people forget to pass on information, but I was paranoid to make sure all the history was right, and the process of the nomination which had been fraught with procedural incorrections,\u201d he said.<br /></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve nailed that, we\u2019ve since got a new council, and I\u2019m confident as chair that the process has been totally open and transparent under the act.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/24/noel-pearson-indigenous-australia-thwarted-by-rednecks-and-greenies\">Noel Pearson: Indigenous Australia thwarted by 'rednecks and greenies'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kraft said there was a lot of passion for the land, both for and against heritage listing.</p> <p>Tollner had the option of accepting the council\u2019s recommendation, requesting more information or a variation in it, or rejecting it.<br /></p> <p>Speaking after the council made its decision but before he had seen it, Tollner told Guardian Australia \u201cwe\u2019re not in the business of heritage listing town camps\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you see important pieces of historic infrastructure and relics that are worth preserving, we certainly look at doing what we can to preserve those features but when it comes to town camps I\u2019m not of the view that we want to protect that.\u201d</p>",
