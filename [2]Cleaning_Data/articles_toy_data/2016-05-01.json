The federal cabinet secretary and former Howard government adviser last week week declined to give evidence before a Senate inquiry into Liberal fundraising groups such as the Free Enterprise Foundation (FEF). The inquiry is the latest in a series of investigations into a scheme before the 2011 NSW election to \u201cwash\u201d donations from property developers \u2013 illegal at the time \u2013 into Liberal party coffers. Sinodinos at the time was the party\u2019s treasurer and chair of its finance committee, but has denied any knowledge that a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount of the $700,000 donated by the FEF had come from property developers.

      "bodyText": "The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has said Australia has the right to reject sale of land to foreign bidders and shrugged off concerns investors would be deterred by the government\u2019s decision to block the sale of Australia\u2019s largest landholder. On Friday the treasurer, Scott Morrison, blocked the sale of S Kidman &amp; Co to a majority Chinese-owned consortium because it \u201cmay be contrary to the national interest\u201d. The sale of the company\u2019s assets, which comprises 2.5% of Australia\u2019s agricultural land or 1.3% of Australia\u2019s land mass, was worth $370.7m. The Chinese-owned would-be majority owner, Dakang Australia Holdings, may respond to the decision by Tuesday, allowing a chance to revise the bid. On Monday, in an interview on Radio National, Joyce refused to be drawn on whether the government would reject a revised foreign bid for Australia\u2019s largest agricultural landholder before it goes into caretaker mode before a 2 July double-dissolution election. Joyce said the blocked sale sent the message Australia would determine investment decisions based on its national interests. In a testy interview Joyce repeated formulations of \u201cwe have the right to say the word \u2018no\u2019\u201d and framed interviewer Fran Kelly\u2019s questions about the principle behind the decision as a contradiction of that right. \u201cIt sounds like you want me to say yes,\u201d he said. When asked why the sale wasn\u2019t in Australia\u2019s national interest, Joyce said: \u201cI think it\u2019s because an incredibly large section of land, it\u2019s 2.5% of our agricultural land, [or] 1% of Australia. \u201cLet\u2019s not get carried away \u2013 we\u2019re not blocking every sale.\u201d Joyce described Australia as \u201cthe most liberal nation on earth\u201d when it came to foreign investment, because foreign buyers were not allowed to buy agricultural land in Japan, China and some US states. Joyce denied the decision would discourage foreign investment. \u201cWe have people lined up out the door, over the hill ... still wanting to buy land,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a large section of foreign investment in agricultural assets. If someone wants to buy up Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, would we let it happen?\u201d When Kelly responded \u201cOf course not\u201d, Joyce said: \u201cYou agree with me. There has to be a line in the sand, now we\u2019re arguing where that line should be drawn.\u201d Asked about a fall in foreign investment from $40bn in 2014 to $30bn last year, Joyce said in the agricultural sector it had \u201cgone through the roof\u201d so blaming the fall on rejection of agricultural land sales was \u201clooking in the wrong direction\u201d. Joyce refused to say whether the government would reject a revised bid before going into caretaker mode, saying it was a matter for the treasurer. \u201cLet\u2019s try and stick to our knitting,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m agriculture and water resources, and we\u2019re doing a splendid job in the Coalition in that area ... I\u2019m only too happy to talk about how we\u2019ve released the carp herpes virus and how we\u2019re going to rid our waterways of carp.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Crucible set for world contract extension as Mark Selby takes lead in final", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mark Selby and Ding Junhui were involved in a titanic tussle on the first day of the world championship final and the good news for snooker fans is that a deal is about to be announced that will keep the event at the Crucible Theatre, the game\u2019s spiritual home since 1977. The contract with The Crucible comes to an end next year and there had been speculation that the world championship \u2013 which earns \u00a35m for Sheffield over the 17 days of the competition \u2013 could leave the city and even move abroad. But as Selby and Ding slugged through 17 frames on the first day of the two-day encounter, with the former taking an overnight lead of 10-7 in the best-of-35 final, the 40th at the famous theatre, Jason Ferguson, chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, told The Guardian: \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us in the sport have the heart to change. We\u2019ve had substantial offers to move the world championship. But what price do you put on history? What price do you put on heritage? On those wonderful photographs you see when you walk backstage? Taking snooker away from here would be like taking the Wimbledon tennis championships away from Wimbledon. \u201cI\u2019m hoping for a long-term deal \u2013 and I\u2019m hoping an announcement will be made very shortly.\u201d But Ferguson is still concerned the game is under-selling itself, staging its main championship at a venue that can hold only 986 spectators. He said: \u201cThe restriction here is the venue itself. I can\u2019t criticise the venue because it\u2019s the greatest atmosphere on the world snooker tour. It\u2019s drama and it creates everything we want. But if we look at the size and scale of the sport now, we could easily fill 3,000 seats, which would be about right for the world championship. We\u2019re already doing about 2,500 for the German Masters in Berlin and the atmosphere is incredible.\u201d Beyond the next deal, snooker is looking at the possibility of moving to a new, bespoke venue in the city \u2013 or even enlarging the capacity at The Crucible. Ferguson believes Ding\u2019s first appearance in the world championship final has taken the sport to a new level of interest in China. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s already huge in China. They\u2019ve got 1,500 snooker clubs in Shanghai alone, 1,200 in Beijing. These are huge numbers. In participation it is big but in media and television it is also very big and if Ding wins, it has the potential to be enormous. I know that a great nation is viewed to the television hoping their man is going to win.\u201d Viewers in China must have been subdued when Ding went 6-0 down in the opening session, before pulling back to 6-2. He had been the form player in this championship and was up against a man who had not shown his true form until the concluding stages of his semi-final against Marco Fu on Saturday night. But he looked nervous in the opening exchanges as Selby, whose confidence survived the replacement of his cue tip, took control and enjoyed breaks of 120, 91 and 76. In the second, nine-frame session, however, Ding won three of the first four frames to cut the deficit to 7-5. After the interval the next two frames were shared before an epic, 66-minute frame was eventually won by Ding after Selby had failed to secure the snookers he needed. TV commentator and former world champion John Parrott compared Selby, nicknamed The Torturer, with \u201ca boa constrictor\u201d. Despite winning the frame Ding\u2019s fluency had been broken and Selby won the final two frames of the night. Ferguson, meanwhile, has his eyes on India as snooker\u2019s next boom nation. He said: \u201cThe game was invented there by the British army in 1875 and I it could go back to it\u2019s roots. \u201cThis is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. We launched the Indian Open there two years ago. It\u2019s been to three different cities. The interest is there, but it needs developing commercially.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Mark Selby and Ding Junhui were involved in a titanic tussle on the first day of the world championship final and the good news for snooker fans is that a deal is about to be announced that will keep the event at the Crucible Theatre, the game\u2019s spiritual home since 1977.</p> <p>The contract with The Crucible comes to an end next year and there had been speculation that the world championship \u2013 which earns \u00a35m for Sheffield over the 17 days of the competition \u2013 could leave the city and even move abroad.</p> <p>But as Selby and Ding slugged through 17 frames on the first day of the two-day encounter, with the former taking an overnight lead of 10-7 in the best-of-35 final, the 40th at the famous theatre, Jason Ferguson, chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, told The Guardian: \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us in the sport have the heart to change. We\u2019ve had substantial offers to move the world championship. But what price do you put on history? What price do you put on heritage? On those wonderful photographs you see when you walk backstage? Taking snooker away from here would be like taking the Wimbledon tennis championships away from Wimbledon.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping for a long-term deal \u2013 and I\u2019m hoping an announcement will be made very shortly.\u201d</p> <p>But Ferguson is still concerned the game is under-selling itself, staging its main championship at a venue that can hold only 986 spectators. He said: \u201cThe restriction here is the venue itself. I can\u2019t criticise the venue because it\u2019s the greatest atmosphere on the world snooker tour. It\u2019s drama and it creates everything we want. But if we look at the size and scale of the sport now, we could easily fill 3,000 seats, which would be about right for the world championship. We\u2019re already doing about 2,500 for the German Masters in Berlin and the atmosphere is incredible.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond the next deal, snooker is looking at the possibility of moving to a new, bespoke venue in the city \u2013 or even enlarging the capacity at The Crucible. Ferguson believes Ding\u2019s first appearance in the world championship final has taken the sport to a new level of interest in China. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s already huge in China. They\u2019ve got 1,500 snooker clubs in Shanghai alone, 1,200 in Beijing. These are huge numbers. In participation it is big but in media and television it is also very big and if Ding wins, it has the potential to be enormous. I know that a great nation is viewed to the television hoping their man is going to win.\u201d</p> <p>Viewers in China must have been subdued when Ding went 6-0 down in the opening session, before pulling back to 6-2. He had been the form player in this championship and was up against a man who had not shown his true form until the concluding stages of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/01/mark-selby-marco-fu-snooker-world-championship\" title=\"\">his semi-final against Marco Fu on Saturday night</a>. But he looked nervous in the opening exchanges as Selby, whose confidence survived the replacement of his cue tip, took control and enjoyed breaks of 120, 91 and 76.</p> <p>In the second, nine-frame session, however, Ding won three of the first four frames to cut the deficit to 7-5. After the interval the next two frames were shared before an epic, 66-minute frame was eventually won by Ding after Selby had failed to secure the snookers he needed. TV commentator and former world champion John Parrott compared Selby, nicknamed The Torturer, with \u201ca boa constrictor\u201d. Despite winning the frame Ding\u2019s fluency had been broken and Selby won the final two frames of the night.</p> <p>Ferguson, meanwhile, has his eyes on India as snooker\u2019s next boom nation. He said: \u201cThe game was invented there by the British army in 1875 and I it could go back to it\u2019s roots. \u201cThis is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. We launched the Indian Open there two years ago. It\u2019s been to three different cities. The interest is there, but it needs developing commercially.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "I am at Kardinia Park, on The Terrace at the city end, standing with J. Dunne, Dips O\u2019Donnell and David Fordyce (who all love the Geelong Football Club). It\u2019s a warm night, we have dined at a local pub (as has been the tradition in Geelong since the 1870s) and we expect the Cats to win. To be at Kardinia Park, or Simonds Stadium as new money dictates it is now called, is routine. Routine for townsfolk who love their footy club. Routine for those who live with the Geelong Football Club in their hearts, and have done so for a lifetime. And yet it\u2019s not routine. It\u2019s where we happen to be at that given moment, all 22,000 of us. Us? That us is made up of the crowd, the players, the officials, and those who have a role in hosting the match. Life has brought us to the game between (our) Geelong and the Gold Coast Suns. We all have our own story, our own reason for being here. Some stories are better known than others. But each story has its own quiddity, as poet Les Murray would say. Its own truth. Football has been played at Kardinia Park, or Chilwell Flats, since the second world war, when Corio Oval (that great home ground of the parklands of East Geelong) was seconded by the authorities for military training. Kardinia Park has seen many fine matches, many superb players, many stirring performances. I am interested in the story of everyone in the ground, but I am most interested in two stories: the stories of Gary Ablett and Patrick Dangerfield. Which is really three stories, because I am telling the story and I am a Geelong fan and that puts me in the middle of it all. Ablett is back home, playing for the side which secured him a mountain of cash and the prospect of being the central figure in the founding of a club \u2013 which may one day have the history Geelong has. With his signature he was instantly an elder statesman, a mentor, a skipper. It is a role which he grew into and he appears to have relished. He would always have become the respected elder statesman at Geelong. You don\u2019t win a swag of Player Association MVPs, voted by your peers, and Brownlows, and other awards without respect. But he chose the Suns. Dangerfield is also back home, after time in Adelaide, another football-besotted community where the pig leather matters. He has come home to the country of his family and his childhood. Of all the recruits in all the sports in all the known universe, I am happy to bet that Paddy Dangerfield\u2019s transition has been the easiest. It is without a trouble \u2013 because he has come home. Although they may be disappointed, few Crows begrudge him, because the sense of \u201chome\u201d transcends football. Indeed, the notion of \u201chome\u201d augments football and helps give depth to its significance. Ablett turns 32 on Saturday week. How we remember his early days when he was so boyish and we wondered whether he had been recruited in the hope that genes were a determinant, and that he would have at least some of his father\u2019s ridiculous talent. He had hair then and he ran around madly. He also had a footballer\u2019s sensibility. Two elements are memorable. The first: when the Cats lacked a dominant centre half forward, a pocket-sized Ablett would be drawn to lead up and make a contest when no-one else would. It was instinctive. The second: when Bomber Thompson would clear everyone out of the 50 and put young Ablett one-out in the square, and he showed he could beat them, any size. We soon learnt that Gary Ablett Jnr was his own man, who had his own way of playing footy. How we remember his role in the rise and rise of the Cats. And his place in the 2007 premiership. We will never forget that goal, receiving the tap from Brad Ottens, at the crisis moment of the 2007 preliminary final against Collingwood \u2013 the match was a modern classic. Or him dashing away after receiving the toe-poke from Matty Scarlett against St Kilda in 2009. Or how elusive he became as he mastered his craft. Or the last game he played for Geelong, in the preliminary final loss to Collingwood in the Pies\u2019 2010 premiership year when he was best on ground in a side which was otherwise humiliated. A crazy night, that will never be forgotten, as it was (more significantly) the night my father died and we sat around our lounge room in what was instantly a new world, and one we had to make sense of. Dangerfield, who grew up in Moggs Creek and went to school in Geelong at Oberon College, is younger. He was drafted late in 2007. Until this year, those of us who love the Hoops, had watched him from afar \u2013 for me, mainly on television. But to see him live in that first round game against Hawthorn was to fall instantly for a man of phenomenal football talent. And yes, he was one of us. So, as the players come out on a barmy April evening, we clap Gary Ablett with the utmost respect, and we cheer Patrick Dangerfield because he is \u201cthe now\u201d. I am a great believer in \u201cthe now\u201d, knowing how fortunate we are to be experiencing it. I also believe in celebrating the gifted, whose talent gives us so much. As the game gets under way, the contest is tight for a while, but soon the signs are good for the home side. The Suns cannot match a Geelong side which is sparkling. Ablett is up against it. No matter how brilliant, the individual will struggle to shine when the opposing side is superior. And so, on the night, Ablett looks like the veteran. He has moments of creativity where he brings team-mates into the game. But he lacks verve and he has little impact. Perhaps his body is not quite right. And then, in the second half, that bouncy colt Mark Blicavs runs with him, and gives him nothing. By comparison, Dangerfield is explosive. His power is evident in his attack on the footy and in his acceleration. It\u2019s one thing to have pace, but to get to top pace so quickly is such an asset. Add his balance \u2013 he can move ridiculously quickly even when low to the ground - his ball skills, his penetrating kicking, and his ability to fly for a mark, and we have a footballer to adore. A footballer to pin our hopes on. He has played six games for Geelong, yet he is one of ours. Dangerfield also has Joel Selwood in his camp. It\u2019s a walloping. Our boys are impressive and we return to our homes knowing the winter will be at least tolerable and at best memorable while acknowledging that this game of Australian football gives us much to admire.",

      "bodyText": "Ed Miliband has joined a cross-party attempt to persuade voters that leaving the EU would damage the environment. The former Labour leader has signed a joint declaration with environment secretary Liz Truss, former energy secretary Ed Davey and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas in what pro-EU campaigners called an unprecedented partnership. They claim that those campaigning for Brexit are climate change deniers who are ignorant of the potential impact. \u201cCollective action is the only solution to rising seas and rising temperatures. The European Union is central to both these challenges,\u201d they say in a pamphlet setting out the arguments. EU membership supported domestic action to improve air quality, protect nature and wildlife and invest in renewable energy, they say, and Brussels is \u201ca leader in the battle to secure binding agreements\u201d internationally. \u201cThose campaigning for Britain to leave Europe cannot be trusted on the environment,\u201d they say. \u201cThey have opposed vital green measures and denounced climate change as \u2018mumbo jumbo\u2019. They demonstrate a cavalier ignorance about climate matters which embodies the extreme and out-dated outlook of those who want to leave. \u201cIf Britain leaves Europe, our environment, our wildlife and our global habitat will be starved of investment, bereft of protections and denied the leadership it needs,\u201d the declaration says. But environment minister George Eustice \u2013 who supports Vote Leave \u2013 said the EU had \u201csystematically undermined the UK\u2019s place on international wildlife conventions\u201d. \u201cWe have already been stripped of our voting rights on regional fisheries management organisations and, extraordinarily, it is now unlawful for the UK to speak at wildlife conventions like Cites (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) without first getting permission for what we want to say from the European commission. \u201cIf we vote to leave and take control, the UK would regain its own seat and its voice in vital international wildlife conventions and everything from promoting shark conservation to ending whaling would become much easier.\u201d In a further development, Tory grandee Michael Heseltine has criticised MPs backing Brexit for turning on the government during the debate. The former cabinet minister said some Tory MPs owe their jobs and the party\u2019s surprise general election victory to David Cameron. He told Sky News: \u201cThe facts are that he won this election for the Conservatives, and now to see people who, frankly, many of them would not have their seats and certainly many of them wouldn\u2019t be in government if David Cameron hadn\u2019t won that election for the Conservatives. \u201cAnd to see them now turning on the policies that some of them have been sitting in the government implementing, I just find mind-blowing.\u201d It comes after senior figures insisted the Conservatives could unify after what has been a fractious EU referendum campaign. On the Andrew Marr show, Ukip leader Nigel Farage claimed Cameron would not continue as prime minister if the UK voted to leave the EU.",

The hygiene scores for more than 412,000 English premises can currently be found on the Food Standards Agency\u2019s website.

      "bodyText": "Tips in restaurants, hotels and bars should go to workers and not their employers, the government said in a report published on Monday. After an eight-month review of tipping practices, the government said charges imposed on staff tips by employers should be scrapped or limited. Service charges on customers\u2019 bills should also be clear and voluntary, the proposals said. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, launched the investigation last August after some of Britain\u2019s best-known restaurant chains were exposed for withholding some or all of the service charges from staff \u2013 often without customers\u2019 knowledge. Unions accused businesses such as Pizza Express and Giraffe of abusing the 2009 voluntary code set up to stop tips being used by employers to meet the minimum wage. Pizza Express, which took 8% of tips paid on a card, and Giraffe, which charged 10%, have since stopped doing so. Chains such as the Mexican street food outlet Wahaca and Jamie Oliver\u2019s Jamie\u2019s Italian have also deducted a percentage of waiters\u2019 card sales to be shared with other workers, but other restaurants have used tips to pay for breakages, till shortfalls and customers failing to pay. The government is seeking views on options to ensure staff get more of their tips including: Banning employer deductions from discretionary service payments other than for tax. Limiting such deductions to the cost of processing credit card tips and dealing with the payment through payroll. Banning or restricting employers from charging waiting staff a percentage of their table sales during a shift. Encouraging properly managed \u201ctroncs\u201d \u2013 arrangements for sharing tips administered by a staff member, not the employer. Publishing the report, Javid said: \u201cWe want workers who earn a tip to be able to keep it. That\u2019s why I, like many others, was disappointed by the tipping practices of some of our well-known chains. This has to change.\u201d Javid said the government would decide whether to make changes by revamping the 2009 code or, to give the rules more weight, enshrining them in legislation. The Unite union, whose campaign helped expose restaurant chains\u2019 treatment of tips, said the report was a \u201cmassive, rightful victory\u201d and called on Javid to change the law instead of relying on the voluntary code. Dave Turnbull, Unite\u2019s officer for the hospitality industry, said: \u201cThe problem has always been that tips paid on a credit card and service charges are deemed the property of the employer. Until staff are recognised as the lawful owners of their hard-earned tips with complete control over how they are shared out, rogue employers will continue to cream off staff tips.\u201d The proposals also attempt to clear up confusion and dubious practices around service charges added to bills that often go to the employer and not staff. There is no legal requirement for any part of these optional payments to be paid to employees. The government said customers often did not understand the charges were at their discretion and that they deterred diners from leaving a tip on top. Businesses could be banned from adding a service charge or forced to make it clearer that the charge is discretionary. Cover charges imposed by the restaurant also need to be made clearer so consumers know what they will pay, the government said. This article was amended on 3 May. Pizza Express and Giraffe have confirmed that they no longer take a percentage of tips paid on credit cards.",

Research by UHY Hacker Young, found the average income tax payment in Elmbridge, which includes the wealthy towns of Esher, Walton-on-Thames, Cobham and Weybridge, increased to \u00a317,800 in 2014, the latest figures available, up 5% from \u00a316,900 the previous year. The accountancy group said the average income of residents was \u00a364,500, up 8% from the 2013 figure and more than double the UK average of \u00a329,600. The study found that Windsor residents pay the next highest amount of income tax on average, \u00a314,000 a year, up 14% on the previous 12 months. Average gross incomes in the area that surround its castle are now \u00a355,300. On average UK residents pay around \u00a34,820 a year to the Treasury in income tax, according to the research. In recent years, Elmbridge has become \u201cthe area\u201d in which to buy for many of Britain\u2019s top sports stars and entertainers, leading to the moniker the \u201cBeverley Hills of Britain\u201d. Sir Elton John, Sir Cliff Richard, Sir Mick Jagger, John Terry and Andy Murray, are all among the number of celebrities who live or have lived in the area. Strong transport links with London and the proximity to Heathrow airport means it has also become a popular for wealthy Russians. UHY Hacker Young\u2019s Mark Giddens said: \u201cElmbridge is a sought after residential area for high earning celebrities and city brokers. With a number of huge properties with large private grounds, it is a hotspot for wealthy city workers wanting to escape London.\u201d UHY Hacker Young found that the stockbroker belt areas surrounding London, accounted for 26 out of the top 30 constituencies for highest average income tax bill. Only two of the top tax-paying constituencies were outside of the south\u2013east \u2013Altrincham and Tatton. Both have good transport links with Manchester and are well-known celebrity hotspots, home to many current or former Premiership footballers and managers including Sir Alex Ferguson, Peter Crouch and Rio Ferdinand. The average income tax bill in Altrincham is \u00a310,400 with a gross income of \u00a345,900, while in Tatton it is \u00a310,600 with a gross income of \u00a346,000. Giddens said: \u201cManchester is growing in importance to the UK economy and is seen as a good alternative business hub to London. The rising incomes in these areas indicate that Manchester\u2019s economy is going from strength to strength.\u201d",

On Monday it hijacked the insurer QBE\u2019s branding in Sydney, plastering the slogan \u201cMade possible by QBE\u201d over images of coalmines and natural disasters. At about 8am on Monday morning the Market Forces team hung the posters from the QBE headquarters in Sydney\u2019s CBD. Julien Vincent, executive director of Market Forces said they were removed by security after about 10 minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s about highlighting their role in the perpetuation and expansion of the fossil fuel industry, which is contributing to climate change,\u201d said Gocher, who worked for QBE until 2015. \u201cBecause as their slogan tells you, they make it possible.\u201d The activists\u2019 imagery is very similar to one produced by QBE a few years ago. In 2012 the its annual report printed \u201cMade possible by QBE\u201d on the cover, over an image of an operating coalmine. In that report, the company boasted it was \u201ca major insurer of the mining sector in Australia\u201d and insured \u201ccoalminers in the Queensland Bowen Basin and New South Wales Hunter Valley\u201d. Finding out exactly how much insurers were underwriting coal and other fossil fuel projects was difficult, Vincent said. \u201cThe way you learn about it is when there\u2019s been a disaster,\u201d he said. When the world\u2019s largest oil leak occurred in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, it was revealed BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon oil extraction was insured by QBE. Gocher said the group would target other insurers, but QBE was an obvious place to start because it had revealed some of its involvement in the sector. Insurers also held large investment portfolios, Gocher said. Australian insurance companies managed about $200bn worth of stock, $35bn of it held by QBE. Some other insurers have begun to move away from fossil fuels. The French insurer AXA and Germany\u2019s Allianz divested from thermal coal because of climate change. Overseas insurers and reinsurers (companies that insure other insurance companies) have played a significant role in public discussion of climate change after recognising they were particularly exposed to the effects of extreme weather events. In 2015 Muich RE said: \u201cWe are convinced that there are particular regions and hazards where climate change is already having a definite influence on losses. Significant effects have to be accounted for in risk management approaches of the insurance industry.\u201d But despite being hit with large payouts, Australian insurers lagged behind their foreign counterparts, not divesting from fossil fuels and not playing a role in the public discussion, Gocher said. Annual reports show QBE paid US$76m for storms that battered the New South Wales coast in 2014; US$144m for storms Desmond, Eva and Frank in the UK in 2015; US$108m for cyclone Pam, which hit Vanuatu in March. Market Forces has asked Australian insurers to divest from fossil fuel in their investment portfolios, begin withdrawing from underwriting fossil fuel companies and play a role in the public conversation about climate change. Gocher said withdrawal from underwriting could not be done overnight, but companies could immediately cease underwriting new projects. Guardian Australia has approached QBE for response.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Election debates are more common in Holyrood politics than in Westminster politics, as I said earlier, and one of the consequences of that is that they probably make less impact. Viewers get used to their leaders, and they know what to expect. This one did not feel as if was going to change many minds. Nicola Sturgeon is the dominant figure in Scottish politics, and she was tonight too. She was particularly strong on Govan and, even when coming under sustained attack from three of her opponents for her neverendum leanings (see below), she more than held her own. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, put up the strongest opposition. She was a bit too shouty, and relatively glib on the shipyard jobs, but she was forceful, giving credence to the claim she can make the Conservatives the principal opposition to the SNP. Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, seemed to find it harder to differentiate herself from Sturgeon and the SNP (not least because tax, where Labour has very distinct and progressive policy, did not come up). She was unpersuasive on the NHS and sometimes she sounded a bit centrist (see 8.37pm), but not in the way that being centrist worked successfully for Nick Clegg in that first debate in 2010. The Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie at least made a mark with a notable soundbite on independence (see below), and Patrick Harvie was probably best on PFI. One final point. Watching the debate from London, it was notable how little Westminster featured. There was a stage when devolved politics was to a large extent a competition as to who could complain most about the UK government. But that era now seems to have gone. And a good thing too. Here are the key points. Nicola Sturgeon was accused of breaking her promise to honour the result of the independence referendum and of being \u201canti-democratic\u201d. The claim that she had broken a promise was made by Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader. She said Sturgeon should not keep open the \u201cwound\u201d caused by the independence referendum in 2014. Davidson went on: It\u2019s not good for our country, it\u2019s not good for economy, it\u2019s not good for encouraging jobs and growth ... And [Sturgeon] made a promise. She signed a binding agreement that she would respect the result. And that is important. And before the referendum she went around every TV studio she could find and told every person in Scotland that it was once in a generation, once in a lifetime. She has gone back on both those promises. It is not good enough, and it is not up to her to see one opinion poll she likes and say we\u2019re putting this country through it all once more. It\u2019s not on. Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said Sturgeon\u2019s refusal to rule out a second independence referendum was \u201canti-democratic\u201d. He said: We had one of the biggest democratic experiences in our lifetime. [The SNP] celebrated it constantly. But now as soon as it\u2019s over and they did not get the result they wanted, they want to do it all over again. Did they not get the message? We want to stay in the UK. Respect the result. I would even go so far as saying you\u2019re anti-democratic. Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, also said Sturgeon should rule out a second referendum. She said: It\u2019s not good enough. There is not a mandate for a referendum. Yet you [Sturgeon] are in two different papers today saying, \u2018Yes we might have one\u2019 and now saying \u2018No we won\u2019t\u2019, trying to pull the wool over people\u2019s eyes in Scotland, when so many people just want to move on from that referendum of the past. Mocking Sturgeon\u2019s claim that she would only hold a second referendum if there was clear evidence of public support for one, Dugdale went on: She\u2019s saying, \u2018Let\u2019s trust the pollsters\u2019. If we trusted the pollsters, Ed Miliband would be prime minister. This is no way to govern the country. But Sturgeon said it would be wrong to rule out a second referendum. I think the question for other politicians on this platform is what is it they think gives them the right to stand in the way of a majority. Scotland will only become independent if a majority backs that. That is democracy. And none of us should fear the democratic wishes of the people of this country. Davidson was accused of lying about a government decision that could lead to job losses on the Clyde. Dugdale said that Davidson had \u201ctold a porkie\u2019 when she said that the UK government was honouring a promise to build new type-26 frigates on the Clyde. She said: The first thing we can do is keep to the timescale that was made to the people who work on the Clyde. And Ruth has quite frankly told a porkie tonight. There\u2019s an 18-month delay on work on the Clyde and it has to be reversed to honour the promise that was made to people during the referendum. Sturgeon said the Tories had \u201cbetrayed\u201d the shipyard workers. Ruth is really misinformed because the frigate factory, the centre of excellence, that was proposed is one of the things that is not going ahead. I was in Govan shipyard on Monday talking to the unions. The reason why they are worried is because of the delay in the contract that was promised to the workers on the Clyde. Davidson said, if Scotland had voted for independence, there would not be any frigates being built on the Clyde. She also said it was \u201cshameful\u201d that Sturgeon was trying to scare workers about their jobs. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. This is from the former Scottish Labour leader in Scotland Johann Lamont, referring to a question a member of the audience tried to raise. This is from the Times\u2019s Kenny Farquharson on the debate. These are from the BBC\u2019s Philip Sim. The SNP has now put out two news releases about tonight\u2019s debate. In the first, Humza Yousaf, Europe minister in the Scottish government and the SNP candidate for Glasgow Pollok, criticised Ruth Davidson for defending Westminster over the frigates contract. He said: If the promises made to workers on the Clyde by the UK government before the referendum were to be broken, it would be an unforgivable betrayal \u2013 and people in Scotland would have been shocked to see Ruth Davidson try and defend the indefensible during the Leaders Debate tonight. It\u2019s clear that Ruth Davidson will defend David Cameron at any cost, and if she has any respect for workers on the Clyde, she will immediately arrange a meeting with the trade unions \u2013 and apologise for the broken promises of this Tory government. And the second SNP press release claimed the debate showed that Sturgeon was the only credible candidate to be first minister because \u201cKezia Dugdale floundered over her plans to short-change Scotland\u2019s health service and sought to mislead people on their NHS plans, and Ruth Davidson was put under pressure over the Tory government\u2019s broken promises regarding shipbuilding jobs on the Clyde\u201d. There seem to have been two main news lines in the debate. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, was accused of breaking her promise to honour the result of the independence referendum and of being \u201canti-democratic\u201d. The claim that she had broken a promise was made by Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, and the claim that she was being anti-democratic was made by Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader. Sturgeon rejected these claims, saying that it would be undemocratic to ignore the will of the Scottish people if a majority wanted independence. Davidson was accused of lying about a government decision that could lead to job losses on the Clyde. Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, said that Davidson had \u201ctold a porkie\u2019 when she said that the UK government was honouring a promise to build new type-26 frigates on the Clyde. Sturgeon said the Tories had \u201cbetrayed\u201d the shipyard workers. Davidson said, if Scotland had voted for independence, there would not be any frigates being built on the Clyde. I\u2019ll post a beefed-up version, with the quotes, soon. Dugdale says she would support the proposal by the EIS teachers union for industrial action over school qualifications. Sturgeon says the SNP government has a working group looking at the concerns raised by teachers. She hopes there will not be any industrial action. And that\u2019s it. The debate is over. I will post a summary and some reaction and analysis shortly. John Swinney, the SNP\u2019s Scottish finance minister, is endorsing the line used by Patrick Harvie. Q: Given the Edinburgh schools PFI fiasco, how would the panel ensure money goes to the right people? Rennie says at the time those PFI deal were justified. But he says there needs to be a proper inquiry into those deals, not least to ensure that private finance arrangements work properly in the futrue. Q: Were those deals a mistake? That\u2019s a difficult question, says Dugdale. At the time those PFI deals were needed because the Tories had left schools in a state of wrack and ruin. There should be a review into what private finance methods work best. She points out that the SNP government is using its own version of PFI. Harvie says PFI was \u201cthe only game in town\u201d because the Labour government in London insisted on it. But it was a mistake, because public borrowing is cheaper than private borrowing. She says public ownership of infrastructure is the best approach. Sturgeon says the SNP would increase health spending by \u00a3500m more than inflation. She says Labour is only proposing to increase health spending in line with inflation. That is shocking, she says. And that is less than the Barnett consequentials would imply. That is not true, says Dugdale. Q: So what does your manifesto say? Dugdale says it says Labour would increase NHS spending in line with inflation. But, using the revenue from tax increase, extra investment would go into public services. Sarah Smith says Dugdale is not putting a figure on how much would go into the NHS. Dugdale says Labour would keep prescription charges free. Sturgeon says the SNP are committed to investment and reform. They will increase the health budget by \u00a3500m, more than inflation, paid for by not passing on the tax cut for higher-rate tax payers proposed by George Osborne. She says Davidson suggests only rich people would pay prescription charges under her plans. But some people on as little as \u00a316,000 would have to pay prescription charges, she says. And she says people with chronic conditions, like cancer and Parkinson\u2019s, would have to pay. Rennie says mental health should be a priority. There are no mental health beds north of Dundee, he says. Harvie says the next Scottish government should introduce progressive taxation to pay for public services. Q: With an ageing population, and people more reliant on the NHS, how would you protect its funding? Davidson says the Tory manifesto contains plans for an NHS guarantee what would ensure its funding went up every year by 2%, or inflation, or the Barnett consequentials (ie, what England is getting), whichever was bigger. She also defends her plan to bring back prescription charges. The SNP have hit back on Twitter. Dugdale says the new powers coming to the parliament will allow the Scottish parliament to make different choices. Let\u2019s use those powers, she says. She says she is appealing to those who voted yes and no to support this vision. Davidson says Sturgeon has the ability to bring the country back together. All she has to do is say that she will accept the result of the independence referendum, and take the referendum option off the table \u201cat least for the next parliament\u201d. Sturgeon says she is not proposing another referendum tomorrow. All she is saying is that, if a majority of Scots want one, she would give it to them. Sturgeon says she struggles with politicians standing in the way of the will of the public. The referendum that is causing trouble now is the one the Tories are holding on the EU, she says. Q: Should the prime minister prevent a second referendum if the Scots want one? Davidson says there is no mandate for a second referendum. She says Sturgeon has responsibility to the whole of the country, not just the SNP. She should not keep this wound open. She signed an agreement saying she would respect the result of the referendum. And she told people it was a once in a lifetime event. She says Sturgeon has gone back on both those promises. Sarah Smith takes a question from the audience. A woman says that 24 hours after the result the Tory government in London went back on what had been promised. Harvie says he backed independence. Respecting the result of the referendum does not mean those in favour of independence have to shut up about it, he says. Rennie says he does not want to spend the next five years arguing about independence. We had one of the biggest democratic experiences of our lifetime. Did they not get the message? ... I would even go so far as saying they\u2019re anti-democratic. Sturgeon says she favours independence. The question was answered in 2014. But if the public change their mind, and there is clear evidence that people want a second referendum, they should have it. None of us should fear the democratic wishes of the people of this country, she says. She says she believes in something. She will not abandon her support for independence. What on earth is it about the democratic will that some people on this platform seem to find so frightening? Q: If in the future a majority of Scots want a second independence referendum, who are politicians to stop them? Dugdale says she believed Sturgeon when she said the referendum was a once in a lifetime opportunity. She says that in one paper today Sturgeon says she favours a second one. In another paper, she says she is opposed. Q: But what if the polls showed a clear majority of people said they wanted one? Dugdale says, if the polls were right, Ed Miliband would be prime minister. Labour is opposed to a second referendum, she says. Dugdale says Davidson has \u201ctold a porkie\u201d. There is an 18-month delay on the contract for the Glasgow frigate. Sturgeon says she was on the Clyde recently. The workers there are worried by the delay. Davidson says Sturgeon has been \u201cshameful\u201d in what she has said about the Govan shipyard. She says that if the SNP had had its way in 2014, there would have been no orders for the yard. Davidson says the SNP would not be building any of these. Sturgeon says the Tory government Davidson supports has \u201cbetrayed\u201d the shipyard workers. Here are some party tweets commenting on the debate so far. From the SNP From Scottish Labour From David Mundell, the Conservative Scottish secretary Willie Rennie says we need to invest in education. That is why we need \u201ca modest penny\u201d on income tax. He would invest in people\u2019s skills and talents. This is from the BBC\u2019s Philip Sim. Patrick Harvie says the Greens also believe in the need for investment in public services. And they want businesses to ensure they invest in the community. It is about changing the way the economy works, he says. And the Greens are the only party committed to moving away from a reliance on fossil fuels. Kezia Dugdale says we need to invest in people. She says Davidson\u2019s arguments come out of the 1980s. If we continue to cut education budgets, Scotland would get left behind. Q: Labour would oppose the renewal of Trident. But you have not said how you would protect those jobs? Dugdale says Labour is committed to a defence diversification agency. It would find new jobs for those workers. She says the SNP have often said how they would spend the Trident money. But they have never said they would protect the shipyard jobs. Q: Your manifesto promise sounds hollow. It does not say how those jobs would be protected. Dugdale says Labour\u2019s manifesto process is an honest one. It reflects the party\u2019s views. Ruth Davidson says the increase for large businesses will affect one business in seven, and will make them uncompetitive compared to the rest of the UK. She says it is mistake to make Scotland the high tax part of the UK. She says the Tories want a business rates freeze. The SNP have been using business rates as a cash cow. And, going back to the jobs questions, she says the Tories want to improve skills and increase apprenticeships. Q: But we\u2019ve had warnings that jobs could be lost on the Clyde if the Type 26 frigate contracts are delayed. Davidson says she spoke to the business secretary and was told there was no delay to the strategic defence review. Nicola Sturgeon says there has been a delay. It is an \u201cabsolute betrayal\u201d, she says. Here\u2019s the first question. Q: What specific plans do you have to create more jobs? Nicola Sturgeon says supporting small business is at the heart of the SNP\u2019s manifesto. The party would continue the small business bonus. It will review business rates. It wants to help firms export, because the more firms export, the more innovative they are. And the SNP particularly wants to help the young find a job. It wants to use a youth jobs grant to help. Jobs figures have been \u201cchallenging\u201d recently. Much done. But much more still to do. Q: But unemployment is higher in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. Business leaders say putting up business rates will cost jobs. Sturgeon says this will just affect big businesses. Ruth Davidson says the rate has been doubled. The BBC Scotland debate is starting. Sarah Smith is presenting. David Cockburn, Ukip\u2019s sole Scottish MEP, took part in the first BBC Scottish leaders debate but has been excluded from this one. He plans to offer his comment on Periscope. He tried this during the STV debate but it was not a great success. Hopetoun House may look like, but the journalists aren\u2019t impressed by the wifi. This is from BuzzFeed\u2019s Jamie Ross. For anyone interested in a recap, here is a BBC live blog from the first debate. And here is a news story about what was said, focusing on Nicola Sturgeon saying she does eventually want to introduce a 50p top rate of tax, but explaining why she thought it would be \u201cdaft\u201d to introduce it next year (because officials say it would lose money). And here is a news story about the STV debate, focusing on Ruth Davidson accusing Sturgeon of \u201ckeeping Scotland on a knife-edge\u201d until the SNP leader believes she can win a second independence referendum. Here\u2019s the set. Although the Hopetoun House debate venue is rather grand, efforts are being made to ensure that the journalists covering the event do not get ideas above their station. This is from the Scottish Daily Mail\u2019s Alan Roden. And this is from my colleague Severin Carrell. One of the many things that makes Holyrood politics more modern and straightforward than Westminster politics is that election debates are the norm. There is never a problem with leaders refusing to take part because they are ahead in the polls, and none of this nonsense about how debating the issues at the heart of the election campaign could distract attention away from the election campaign. They are just an intrinsic part of the process. And tonight we are getting the final debate of the Scottish election campaign before voting takes place on Thursday. We\u2019ve already had one debate hosted by BBC Scotland, and another hosted by STV. Tonight\u2019s is the second BBC Scotland debate, and it features the five main party leaders. Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader and Scotland\u2019s first minister Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader Patrick Harvie, co-convenor of the Scottish Green party It is taking place at Hopetoun House, on the outskirts of Edinburgh. As the BBC\u2019s Philip Sim says, the location is rather grand. It starts at 8pm. In Scotland you can watch it on BBC One, and for those of you living outside Scotland, it is on BBC News. I will be covering it in full, and providing comment and reaction afterwards. If you want to follow me, or get in touch, on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow.",

Viewers get used to their leaders, and they know what to expect. This one did not feel as if was going to change many minds.</p> <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> is the dominant figure in Scottish politics, and she was tonight too. She was particularly strong on Govan and, even when coming under sustained attack from three of her opponents for her neverendum leanings (see below), she more than held her own. <strong>Ruth Davidson</strong>, the Scottish Conservative leader, put up the strongest opposition. She was a bit too shouty, and relatively glib on the shipyard jobs, but she was forceful, giving credence to the claim she can make the Conservatives the principal opposition to the SNP. <strong>Kezia Dugdale</strong>, the Scottish Labour leader, seemed to find it harder to differentiate herself from Sturgeon and the SNP (not least because tax, where Labour has very distinct and progressive policy, did not come up). She was unpersuasive on the NHS and sometimes she sounded a bit centrist (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/01/scottish-election-leaders-debate-bbc-scotland-politics-live?page=with:block-57265a95e4b02046f02ec396#block-57265a95e4b02046f02ec396\">8.37pm)</a>, but not in the way that being centrist worked successfully for Nick Clegg in that first debate in 2010. The Scottish Lib Dem leader <strong>Willie Rennie</strong> at least made a mark with a notable soundbite on independence (see below), and<strong> Patrick Harvie</strong> was probably best on PFI.</p> <p>One final point. Watching the debate from London, it was notable how little Westminster featured. There was a stage when devolved politics was to a large extent a competition as to who could complain most about the UK government. But that era now seems to have gone. And a good thing too.</p> <p>Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Nicola Sturgeon was accused of breaking her promise to honour the result of the independence referendum and of being \u201canti-democratic\u201d. </strong>The claim that she had broken a promise was made by <strong>Ruth Davidson,</strong> the Scottish Conservative leader. She said Sturgeon should not keep open the \u201cwound\u201d caused by the independence referendum in 2014. Davidson went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s not good for our country, it\u2019s not good for economy, it\u2019s not good for encouraging jobs and growth ... And [Sturgeon] made a promise. She signed a binding agreement that she would respect the result. And that is important. And before the referendum she went around every TV studio she could find and told every person in Scotland that it was once in a generation, once in a lifetime. She has gone back on both those promises. It is not good enough, and it is not up to her to see one opinion poll she likes and say we\u2019re putting this country through it all once more. It\u2019s not on.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Willie Rennie</strong>, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said Sturgeon\u2019s refusal to rule out a second independence referendum was \u201canti-democratic\u201d. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We had one of the biggest democratic experiences in our lifetime. [The SNP] celebrated it constantly. But now as soon as it\u2019s over and they did not get the result they wanted, they want to do it all over again. Did they not get the message? We want to stay in the UK. Respect the result. I would even go so far as saying you\u2019re anti-democratic.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Kezia Dugdale,</strong> the Scottish Labour leader, also said Sturgeon should rule out a second referendum. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s not good enough. There is not a mandate for a referendum. Yet you [Sturgeon] are in two different papers today saying, \u2018Yes we might have one\u2019 and now saying \u2018No we won\u2019t\u2019, trying to pull the wool over people\u2019s eyes in Scotland, when so many people just want to move on from that referendum of the past.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mocking Sturgeon\u2019s claim that she would only hold a second referendum if there was clear evidence of public support for one, Dugdale went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>She\u2019s saying, \u2018Let\u2019s trust the pollsters\u2019. If we trusted the pollsters, Ed Miliband would be prime minister. This is no way to govern the country. </p> </blockquote> <p>But Sturgeon said it would be wrong to rule out a second referendum.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think the question for other politicians on this platform is what is it they think gives them the right to stand in the way of a majority. Scotland will only become independent if a majority backs that. That is democracy. And none of us should fear the democratic wishes of the people of this country.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Davidson was accused of lying about a government decision that could lead to job losses on the Clyde.</strong><strong> </strong>Dugdale said that Davidson had \u201ctold a porkie\u2019 when she said that the UK government was honouring a promise to build new type-26 frigates on the Clyde. She said:<br /></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first thing we can do is keep to the timescale that was made to the people who work on the Clyde. And Ruth has quite frankly told a porkie tonight. There\u2019s an 18-month delay on work on the Clyde and it has to be reversed to honour the promise that was made to people during the referendum.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sturgeon said<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/22/clyde-shipworkers-glasgow-fear-for-jobs-mod-contracts-delays\"> the Tories had \u201cbetrayed\u201d the shipyard workers.</a> <br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ruth is really misinformed because the frigate factory, the centre of excellence, that was proposed is one of the things that is not going ahead. I was in Govan shipyard on Monday talking to the unions. The reason why they are worried is because of the delay in the contract that was promised to the workers on the Clyde.</p> </blockquote> <p>Davidson said, if Scotland had voted for independence, there would not be any frigates being built on the Clyde. She also said it was \u201cshameful\u201d that Sturgeon was trying to scare workers about their jobs.</p> <p>That\u2019s all from me for tonight.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-01T21:51:50.225Z\">at 10.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-572670a2e4b02046f02ec3a8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-01T21:10:30.061Z\">10.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from the former Scottish Labour leader in Scotland<strong> Johann Lamont,</strong> referring to a question a member of the audience tried to raise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JohannLamont/status/726878932352524289\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/leadersdebate?src=hash\">#leadersdebate</a> Audience member asks q about homelessness.

    "webTitle": "Second Scottish independence vote not yet on table, says Nicola Sturgeon", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nicola Sturgeon has said a second independence referendum will be \u201coff the table\u201d until there is a clear majority in favour of a fresh vote, as she faced a barrage of attacks from her rivals. The Scottish National party leader was accused of misleading voters by breaking her pledges to respect the result of the 2014 vote, coming under sustained pressure from Labour, the Tories and Liberal Democrats over her planned drive this summer to build support for a new referendum. During a frequently ill-tempered debate televised by the BBC, the last before Thursday\u2019s Holyrood election, the leaders clashed over the future of defence ship-building jobs on the Clyde, whose safety had been guaranteed during the referendum, and over health spending. But the clash over independence drew the loudest cheers from the audience. Sturgeon was accused by Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, of \u201ctrying to pull the wool over the eyes of the people of Scotland\u201d by resurrecting the chances of a further referendum in the SNP\u2019s manifesto for Thursday\u2019s Scottish parliament election. With opinion polls showing that support for independence remains just under 50%, despite the surge in overall support for the SNP and the pro-independence Scottish Greens to a total of around 60%, the SNP\u2019s manifesto takes a cautious stance on the prospects of a second vote. Unlike its clear pledge to stage one in the 2011 Holyrood manifesto, it does not commit the SNP to stage a referendum in this parliament: instead, it says one could be held if there is a material change in Scotland\u2019s circumstances, such as vote to leave the EU against the wishes of Scottish voters, when or a clear popular demand for a further vote. Sturgeon insisted, however, that the SNP was respecting voters\u2019 wishes. \u201cIf there\u2019s no change in opinion, then it will be off the table,\u201d the first minister said. But, she added, \u201cif there\u2019s clear and sustained evidence that the majority of people in Scotland do want a referendum, then no politician has the right to stand in the way of the way of the democratic wishes of the Scottish people\u201d. Sturgeon had repeatedly told voters before the 2014 referendum it would be a once in a lifetime, once in a generation, event. But now, Dugdale said: \u201cIt\u2019s mebbes if, mebbes aye and mebbes no; trust me and I will ask the pollsters.\u201d Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, whose party are nearly neck and neck with Labour in election opinion polls, said Sturgeon had signed a pledge in the Edinburgh agreement in December 2012 to set up the referendum which said she would respect its result. \u201cHer responsibilities are to the whole of the country, not just the SNP,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cHer responsibilities mean that she shouldn\u2019t be keeping this wound open.\u201d Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, said the priority of politicians now was to use the country\u2019s new tax and welfare powers to focus solely on domestic policies. \u201cWe will not achieve that by having a groundhog day on independence if your disrespect the result [of the 2014 referendum],\u201d he said. Clearly exasperated with being defended only by Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green party leader, Sturgeon told her opponents: \u201cWhat I struggle with are politicians who clearly have a difficulty saying if a majority of people in Scotland want something, then they will stand in the way of that.\u201d The debate at Hopetoun House, a stately home outside Edinburgh, came after the latest poll by Panelbase for the Sunday Times and Real Radio confirmed the SNP\u2019s dominance with only five days to the election. It gave the SNP 49% of the constituency vote, 26 points ahead of Labour, and 44% on the regional list vote, 22 points ahead of Labour. Prof John Curtice, the elections expert at the University of Strathclyde, has said Labour has a marginal lead of only two points over the Scottish Conservatives on the regional list vote, in an average of six polls carried out during the main campaign before. While these polls show Labour is on average three points ahead at 20 to 17 in the first-past-the-post constituency vote, Labour is on course to lose all or the vast majority of its 15 constituency seats, leaving it heavily dependent on winning as many of Holyrood\u2019s 53 list seats as possible. There were angry clashes over the fate of thousands of defence jobs at BAE\u2019s shipyards on the Clyde, where eight Royal Navy frigates are due to be built, after Ruth Davidson insisted the Ministry of Defence had guaranteed the contracts would go ahead. To cheers from the audience, Sturgeon said that BAE wanted the construction timetable to slip, risking jobs. Dugdale accused Davidson of \u201ctelling porkies\u201d because the destroyers were facing an 18-month delay. She said the Tories had to \u201cmake sure that [they] honour the promise that they made during the referendum\u201d. Dugdale was later accused by Sturgeon of being \u201csimply dishonest\u201d about her party\u2019s manifesto pledge on NHS spending, after the Labour leader claimed that her party\u2019s spending promises were the same as the SNP\u2019s pledge to increase health funding by \u00a3500m above inflation by 2021. Sturgeon insisted that Labour\u2019s manifesto only increased NHS spending by at least inflation, a rate which would be lower than Scotland\u2019s forecast share of UK health spending in future. \u201cI think it\u2019s shocking for a Labour party to say that when it\u2019s not true,\u201d she said. Dugdale said Sturgeon was ignoring the fact that the SNP\u2019s taxation plans would see \u00a33bn cut from public spending. That would not happen under Labour\u2019s plans to increase income tax revenues by up by \u00a31.2bn by 2021 \u2013 a figure four times greater than the SNP\u2019s plans.",

Brian Message, of the band\u2019s management company Courtyard Management, has previously said the new album, a follow-up to 2011\u2019s King of Limbs, would be released in June. But by 1 May, some wondered whether it could come sooner, perhaps via an unusual method of delivery. Some fans have recently received cards in the mail emblazoned with the band\u2019s bear logo and the words: \u201cSing the song of sixpence that goes \u2018Burn the witch\u2019.\u201d The band have a history of unveiling their music in unusual ways. Frontman Thom Yorke himself was among those handing out Radiohead-themed newspapers at record stores upon the release of King of Limbs. That album appeared within days of the band announcing it, heralded by a music video for the song Lotus Flower. The previous album, In Rainbows, was initially distributed online, and fans were invited to pay any price they chose in order to download the songs. And a more recent Thom Yorke project, Tomorrow\u2019s Modern Boxes, was provided via the download service BitTorrent, with a song and a video available for free. As the band\u2019s ninth album approached, fans discussed how they might like to receive it, with suggestions ranging from a \u201csurprise webcast\u201d to \u201cdirectly into my vein\u201d.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rafael Ben\u00edtez says he finds mind games boring but the worrying thing for Sam Allardyce and Alex Neil is that, right now, he has no need to resort to them. Underpinned by a famously forensic eye for detail, the Spaniard\u2019s aura of calm, good-natured authority is transforming Newcastle United to the point where supporters of Allardyce\u2019s Sunderland and Neil\u2019s Norwich City are becoming unsettled. By simply being himself, Ben\u00edtez has not only galvanised his own team but planted seeds of doubt in the minds of both rivals. A combination of the Spaniard\u2019s grace under pressure and Newcastle\u2019s best Premier League run since 2014 has fuelled real hope on Tyneside that a team one and two points, respectively, ahead of the other contenders for the last two relegation spots can stay out of the bottom three. Considering Norwich and Sunderland have a game in hand, the odds remain against St James\u2019 Park staging top-tier football next season but Ben\u00edtez retains the air of an experienced pilot quietly confident he can safely accomplish a high-risk landing on an icy runway buffeted by crosswinds. \u201cIt\u2019s not 100% in our hands,\u201d acknowledged Newcastle\u2019s manager, who knows he needs another win at Aston Villa on Saturday. \u201cBut we\u2019re going in the right direction, we\u2019re doing the right things, we\u2019re enjoying this challenge and we\u2019ll try and enjoy it until the end.\u201d The fragility of such pleasure was emphasised by the nervous undercurrents rippling through a capacity crowd before the excellent Andros Townsend sent a sublime free-kick curving into the top corner. Indeed the tension would surely have become unbearable had Karl Darlow not subsequently dived low to his left and saved a Yohan Cabaye penalty that threatened to offer Crystal Palace a point. It was typical of Ben\u00edtez that, when Rob Elliot ruptured his cruciate ligament and joined the similarly injured Tim Krul in the treatment room, he refused to panic, instead simply stating how lucky Newcastle were to have such a good third-choice goalkeeper. Judging by Darlow\u2019s occasional, generally unconvincing, appearances under previous managers it seemed wishful thinking but, instead, the former Nottingham Forest goalkeeper has been little short of brilliant. Granted his positioning and footwork may be a bit unorthodox at times but he has pulled off a series of fabulous saves \u2013 on Saturday he repelled a difficult volley from Palace\u2019s dangerous Yannick Bolasie and an awkward Cabaye shot \u2013 as his team-mates have reacquainted themselves with the concept of hope. \u201cThis is a big three points for us,\u201d said Darlow, who was shocked to see the penalty awarded for what seemed a nonexistent handball against Moussa Sissoko. If it helped that Cabaye, widely booed by his once adoring former geordie public, struck his kick poorly, Darlow still performed heroics. \u201cI just picked the way to go, dived hard and reacted to the ball,\u201d he said, reflecting on a stop which could yet prove worth \u00a3100m to Newcastle. \u201cIt was possibly the most valuable save I\u2019ve made. It was one of those special moments that could keep us up. We do our research and look through everyone\u2019s penalties before we play them and Cabaye had put his last four or five the other way. So it was just instinct.\u201d Had fortune not frowned on Krul and Elliot, Darlow knows he would not even be warming the bench now so he appreciated it was imperative to take his unexpected chance. \u201cI never had any doubt I could play at this level,\u201d he said. \u201cI just needed an opportunity but now I have to help make sure we stay up.\u201d With Bolasie and Cabaye causing them all sorts of problems Newcastle did not start too well but, gradually, a series of players apparently reborn under Ben\u00edtez came to the fore. While Jamaal Lascelles highlighted his authority at centre-half with a fine, goal-preventing tackle on Connor Wickham, Cheik Tiot\u00e9 made some important interceptions and the impressive Jack Colback began really imposing himself on central midfield. When Townsend\u2019s magnificent free kick arced over the wall, safety felt within reach. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy game,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez. \u201cWhen you see the size of Crystal Palace\u2019s players you realise that, physically, they\u2019re stronger than us so we couldn\u2019t win by just fighting. We had to play football and when we started to move the ball on the floor you could see the difference.\u201d It was all so absorbing that, rather than proving provocatively divisive, Alan Pardew\u2019s presence on his first return to the club since leaving for Palace seemed almost irrelevant. \u201cAlan was braced for a hostile one,\u201d said his assistant, Keith Millen. \u201cBut there was nothing. Newcastle fans realised they had bigger things to worry about.\u201d Man of the match Karl Darlow (Newcastle United)",

    "webTitle": "Slaven Bilic backs West Ham\u2019s Mark Noble for England chance", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The England manager may have compared him to Grant Holt but for Slaven Bilic the merits of Mark Noble are all too obvious. \u201cThere are no midfielders who are having a better season than he is \u2013 constantly from the first game at Arsenal. He\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d purred the West Ham United manager after his captain\u2019s emphatic volley 11 minutes from time sealed a professional victory over West Bromwich Albion. \u201cI was an international coach for six years and the national team is not about the 23 best players in one country. It\u2019s also a team, especially in the big tournaments where they are together for six weeks. It needs atmosphere and everything \u2013 stars and lesser stars and all that. Is he a top-quality player? Of course. Not only today because he scored a couple of goals. It\u2019s every day, every game, every training session. He is top class. Mark is a great person also. He\u2019s playing great. He could help England.\u201d Bilic could have a point. Roy Hodgson\u2019s reluctance to pick a midfielder who has now scored four goals in his last two games as West Ham have revived their push for a place in Europe next season is probably more down to loyalty to others than anything else. Yet as his club ensured they remain in touch with both Manchester clubs after a clinical away victory sparked by Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9\u2019s header, Noble showed signs he could make the transition with ease. \u201cI\u2019m just enjoying my football,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cIt\u2019s really gone well this season and I am playing a bit further forward. We\u2019ve got some really big clubs around challenging for the same thing so we\u2019ve got to keep winning games. We have Swansea at home and then United which is going to be an emotional occasion, followed by Stoke away to end it.\u201d Noble added: \u201cWe are setting standards every day and working hard for each other. We have a good bunch of players and good staff who keep us all on our toes.

      "bodyText": "The mood in the Sunderland camp was a mixture of jubilation, relief and defiance in the immediate moments after the final whistle of the 1-1 draw. Tributes were paid to the prolific Jermain Defoe after he broke Stoke City\u2019s resistance with his equaliser in the fourth minute of stoppage time and Sam Allardyce could be seen delivering a theatrical performance for the fans who were making a racket in the away end, banging his chest with his fist as he marched towards the tunnel. Yet there was also a lingering sense of what might have been. While Sunderland had gripes about Marko Arnautovic\u2019s goal for Stoke, justifiably arguing it should have been disallowed for an apparent push by Peter Crouch on Youn\u00e8s Kaboul, and felt they should have had a penalty in the first half after a handball by Geoff Cameron, their complaints about the officials could not obscure the timidity that infected Allardyce\u2019s players for much of the match. The game was there to be won. Stoke had conceded 12 goals in their previous three matches and have not won since 19 March. Yet while Sunderland have a game in hand on Norwich City and Newcastle United, meaning they will stay up if they win their final three matches against Chelsea, Everton and Watford, they were weighed down by nerves against Stoke and slipped into the bottom three because of Crystal Palace\u2019s defeat at St James\u2019 Park. Having picked up eight points from their past four matches, momentum is swinging in Newcastle\u2019s direction. Sunderland host Chelsea on Saturday and Everton on 11 May, before finishing the season at Vicarage Road, and Allardyce was asked how he will ensure the pressure does not affect them again. \u201cWe talk about the last few games rather than this one,\u201d the manager said. \u201cGet back to that performance against Arsenal. Look at that performance, particularly in the second half, and try to emulate it on Saturday against Chelsea. We\u2019ll need to be at our very best against Chelsea to try to get the all-important win to take advantage of the game in hand we have over Newcastle. \u201cIn terms of the city, it\u2019s very close-knit and the fans are very close. They want to have contact with the players as much as they can. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with that. We\u2019re paid to take the pressure, so let\u2019s take it and play our best. Let\u2019s accept where we are and let the pressure bring the best out of us, so we can make everyone happy at the end of the season.\u201d Just as relevant as Sunderland\u2019s mentality were Allardyce\u2019s tactics. He has gradually made them harder to score against since replacing Dick Advocaat in October but they have drawn five of their past seven matches and failed to play with enough ambition or guile. They have been too reliant on Defoe, who needs more support. He won and scored the penalty that saved a point after he was fouled by Cameron. Allardyce was told that it was the 11th away game in which the striker has scored since joining in January 2015. \u201cIs it really?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a great stat, ain\u2019t it, that? I wish we were playing away next week then! Maybe that\u2019s because he finds a little bit more space because the opposition have to attack you more, maybe that\u2019s the case. We counter-attack and he gets that bit more space and takes full advantage of it. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to thank him for the 14 goals because without them, I think we would already be relegated. We\u2019ve tightened up the defensive side of our game to give opportunities to the players who score.\u201d Yet Newcastle have also improved under Rafael Ben\u00edtez and they will expect to beat Aston Villa on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised because they\u2019ve spent a huge amount of money and have got a lot of quality players \u2013 and they\u2019ve had a bit of fortune today, whereas we didn\u2019t have any good fortune today with the refereeing decisions,\u201d Allardyce said. \u201cThey had good fortune in that Crystal Palace missed a penalty. We could have been in a lot better position had Palace scored. We can\u2019t control that. What we can control is our own destiny, which has first got to be beat Chelsea, then take advantage of the extra game.\u201d Man of the match Jermain Defoe (Sunderland)",

    "webTitle": "Ars\u00e8ne Wenger admits he feared worse from Arsenal fans\u2019 protests", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ars\u00e8ne Wenger felt it was time for change. After 56 minutes of tedium, during which Arsenal had failed to muster a shot on target, the manager broke from his habit and made what had to be considered as an early, unenforced substitution. The Emirates Stadium crowd responded positively to the sight of Danny Welbeck being stripped and ready but the cheers turned to boos when it was revealed it would be Alex Iwobi to make way. In other words, Olivier Giroud was staying on. Up to that point, Giroud had been intensely frustrating, with one moment rather summing things up. The centre-forward took a heavy touch when attempting to control a ball in the area on 48 minutes, then a heavier one and then he went down under no challenge. Goal-kick. The home crowd sighed. Minutes earlier, he had got a lay-off header all wrong inside the box and there had been chuntering in first-half stoppage time when he crumpled to the ground after an aerial challenge with the Norwich City centre-half S\u00e9bastien Bassong. Giroud writhed about for a bit before he jumped back up and was extremely angry. And yet, straight after Welbeck\u2019s introduction, it was Giroud who got his lay-off header just right inside the box to set up the winning goal. Welbeck banged it home for his fifth in 14 appearances since his return from nine and a half months out with knee trouble and Wenger could enjoy a flash of vindication. This was a substitution that could hardly have worked out better and the thought occurred that, perhaps, the old dog still had a trick or two. It was a weird afternoon for Wenger, even if the heavily trailed fan protest against him was relatively tame. He admitted he thought it would be much worse. \u201cFrom what I was told, the whole stadium would be white,\u201d Wenger said after the 1-0 win. Instead, a few hundred dissenters stood up in the 12th minute with their A3-sized \u201cTime for Change\u201d sheets and it was significant there was then a rousing chorus of \u201cOne Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u201d from those who continue to support him. In the 78th minute, there were fewer people to stand up and show the slogan and at full time, there were a handful of banners calling for Wenger to stand aside. The time slots had been chosen to highlight Arsenal\u2019s 12-year wait to regain the Premier League title. \u201cI heard a lot about the protest and I thought that \u2013 I would not say real Arsenal fans \u2013 but the majority of the fans out-sung the so-called protesters,\u201d Alex Neil, the Norwich manager, said. \u201cFor me, that showed the backing that Ars\u00e8ne has got.\u201d Bassong said: \u201cI didn\u2019t even feel it inside the stadium. For me, they were behind the team. When you\u2019re an Arsenal fan, you expect a lot. I didn\u2019t even know when they were protesting or not, so I didn\u2019t pay attention.\u201d Wenger went through his usual stoic routine, saying he was in a public job and had to live with opinions and judgments, and there was an amusing moment when he was asked how he felt about being treated in this way. \u201cI will come to your newspaper and do it as well, and ask you after how you feel,\u201d he replied. What ought to have concerned Wenger was the thousands of empty seats at the Emirates and the flatness of the occasion and the performance. There was no tempo or excitement about his team. And then there was Giroud. After his assist, he laid on an 83rd-minute shooting opportunity for Mohamed Elneny but what stuck in the memory was how Mesut \u00d6zil and Aaron Ramsey would each lose their cool with him after he failed to get into proper positions for a pass from them. Welbeck\u2019s spark and energy shone an uncomfortable light on Giroud and it feels as though the domestic season cannot end quickly enough for him. Norwich also experienced bitter frustration. This was a spirited performance from them and they did have chances, mainly through Nathan Redmond in the first half. They will take some positives into the final three games of their relegation battle and the message from Neil and his players was that they still believed.

But at some point, especially when you are fighting against relegation, you have to score. It\u2019s fundamental.\u201d Man of the match Danny Welbeck (Arsenal)",

After 56 minutes of tedium, during which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/30/arsenal-norwich-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Arsenal had failed to muster a shot on target</a>, the manager broke from his habit and made what had to be considered as an early, unenforced substitution.</p> <p>The Emirates Stadium crowd responded positively to the sight of Danny Welbeck being stripped and ready but the cheers turned to boos when it was revealed it would be Alex Iwobi to make way. In other words, Olivier Giroud was staying on.</p> <p>Up to that point, Giroud had been intensely frustrating, with one moment rather summing things up. The centre-forward took a heavy touch when attempting to control a ball in the area on 48 minutes, then a heavier one and then he went down under no challenge. Goal-kick. The home crowd sighed.</p> <p>Minutes earlier, he had got a lay-off header all wrong inside the box and there had been chuntering in first-half stoppage time when he crumpled to the ground after an aerial challenge with the Norwich City centre-half S\u00e9bastien Bassong. Giroud writhed about for a bit before he jumped back up and was extremely angry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/30/arsenal-norwich-city-premier-league-match-report\">Arsenal climb to third place as Danny Welbeck goal beats Norwich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet, straight after Welbeck\u2019s introduction, it was Giroud who got his lay-off header just right inside the box to set up the winning goal. Welbeck banged it home for his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/14/arsenal-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">fifth in 14 appearances</a> since his return from nine and a half months out with knee trouble and Wenger could enjoy a flash of vindication. This was a substitution that could hardly have worked out better and the thought occurred that, perhaps, the old dog still had a trick or two.</p> <p>It was a weird afternoon for Wenger, even if the heavily trailed fan protest against him was relatively tame. He admitted he thought it would be much worse. \u201cFrom what I was told, the whole stadium would be white,\u201d Wenger said after the 1-0 win. Instead, a few hundred dissenters stood up in the 12th minute with their A3-sized \u201cTime for Change\u201d sheets and it was significant there was then a rousing chorus of \u201cOne Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u201d from those who continue to support him.</p> <p>In the 78th minute, there were fewer people to stand up and show the slogan and at full time, there were a handful of banners calling for Wenger to stand aside. The time slots had been chosen to highlight Arsenal\u2019s 12-year wait to regain the Premier League title.</p> <p>\u201cI heard a lot about the protest and I thought that \u2013 I would not say real Arsenal fans \u2013 but the majority of the fans out-sung the so-called protesters,\u201d Alex Neil, the Norwich manager, said. \u201cFor me, that showed the backing that Ars\u00e8ne has got.\u201d</p> <p>Bassong said: \u201cI didn\u2019t even feel it inside the stadium. For me, they were behind the team. When you\u2019re an Arsenal fan, you expect a lot. I didn\u2019t even know when they were protesting or not, so I didn\u2019t pay attention.\u201d</p> <p>Wenger went through his usual stoic routine, saying he was in a public job and had to live with opinions and judgments, and there was an amusing moment when he was asked how he felt about being treated in this way. \u201cI will come to your newspaper and do it as well, and ask you after how you feel,\u201d he replied.

      "bodyText": "Leicester booked their customary place at the Premiership play-off table but, if they are to reach the final for the first time since 2013, they will probably have to win at a ground where they have tended in recent years to put in some of their lamest performances. As the table stands before this weekend\u2019s final round of matches Leicester will be off to Allianz Park to face the champions, Saracens, having on their last three visits there failed to prove the real thing on the artificial surface. The average score in those games is 32-7 to Sarries and not even training on the same type of surface before January\u2019s game there made a difference. \u201cThere have been no excuses for our performances there,\u201d said the Leicester full-back Mathew Tait, who appeared in the centre against Worcester in the bonus-point victory that ensured the Tigers would finish in the top four for the 12th consecutive season. \u201cSaracens are a good team, firing in Europe with a well-drilled squad that has class players throughout the team. They are the most consistent side in the Premiership and we would not go there under any illusions about the challenge we face. But we know we are capable of beating any side. \u201cIt was a tough week before the Worcester game after losing in the semi-final of the European Cup and, while it was not a perfect result, we got what we want which was a place in the top four. We know we have to improve in the next few weeks.\u201d Leicester were without six of those who started against Racing 92 in the European Champions Cup semi-final. Freddie Burns and Manu Tuilagi were injured but Dan Cole and Ben Youngs were on the bench to provide needed impetus during the second half when Worcester were threatening to take control. The Warriors merited a bonus point for the way they forced Leicester to compete for every scrap of possession. The Tigers were fortunate to be 21-17 ahead at the interval and the telling difference between the sides was the quality the home side had behind the scrum, but the Warriors showed why they were for once not locked in a relegation scrap in the final weeks of the campaign, three times ahead in the opening half. \u201cI was pleased with the performance,\u201d said Dean Ryan, the Worcestershire director of rugby. \u201cIt is important that we end the season on a good note and we were competitive throughout. The game was there to win but we missed a few opportunities and had two tries ruled out, wrongly in my view, for forward passes. We just have to become a bit more clinical.\u201d Leicester Veainu; Thompstone, Betham, Tait (Smith, 70), Goneva; Williams, Harrison (B Youngs, 43); Ayerza (Genge, 52), Ghiraldini (Bateman, 52), Balmain (Cole, 52), Barrow, Kitchener, Slater (capt; Croft, 64), McCaffrey, Fonua (Evans, h-t).

      "bodyText": "Synthetic cannabis is having a \u201cdevastating impact\u201d in British prisons and making it difficult for normal life to continue in some facilities, the chief inspector of prisons has said. Sold as \u201cspice\u201d and \u201cblack mamba\u201d, synthetic cannabis has been blamed for deaths, serious illness and episodes of self-harm among inmates, and some prison officers have reported falling ill from exposure to the fumes. High demand for the compounds has fuelled more severe problems in the prison system than officers have faced from any other drug, with prisoners racking up greater debts, and suffering worse bullying and violence, Peter Clarke told the Guardian. \u201cPrison staff have told me that the effect on individuals and prisons as a whole is unlike anything they have seen before,\u201d said Clarke, who took up the post in February. Synthetic cannabis is an umbrella term for hundreds of chemical compounds that mimic the effects of THC, the active ingredient of cannabis, in the brain. The synthetic forms are often extremely potent, making them a greater threat to users and those around them. A report from the prisons and probation ombudsman last year linked 19 prison deaths between 2012 and 2014 with synthetic cannabis, by far the most common of the new psychoactive substances (NPS). Unlike traditional resin and weed, synthetic cannabis is manufactured in labs and is usually odourless, making it hard for prison staff to tell when inmates are smoking the drugs. While NPS are banned in prisons, large quantities continue to find their way inside. \u201cNPS is having a devastating impact in some of our prisons, more severe than we have seen with other drugs,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cTheir presence in prisons has given rise to debt, bullying and violence. They are destabilising some prisons, making it difficult for normal prison life to continue. \u201cBoth at local and national level there needs to be clear strategies to deal with the supply of these drugs into prisons, and to care for those who suffer from their effects,\u201d he added. \u201cAt the moment the situation appears to be getting worse, not better.\u201d The 2015 ombudsman\u2019s report urged the prisons service to ensure staff had more information about synthetic cannabis and the signs that prisoners were taking them. It called on governors to put in place strategies to reduce the supply of NPS and the violence associated with the drugs. But Steve Gillan at the Prison Officers\u2019 Association (POA) said the prison service was failing in its duty of care for prisoners and prison staff by not adequately dealing with synthetic cannabis. \u201cWe don\u2019t think they, or the government, are taking it seriously enough. Our prisons are awash with synthetic cannabis and prisoners are so out of their heads they don\u2019t know what they are doing sometimes. They are a danger to themselves, they\u2019re attacking staff, and they are attacking other prisoners.\u201d Gillan said the problem was exacerbated by a shortfall in staff needed to perform perimeter checks and thorough searches of prison cells and exercise yards. \u201cWe want prisons properly searched because these drugs are getting dropped in by drones, catapulted over fences, and there are not enough staff to deal with it,\u201d he added. More sniffer dogs are due to be brought into service, but Gillan said it was \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d. Last year\u2019s report from the prisons ombudsman highlighted a number of cases of prisoners dying after using synthetic cannabis. What role the drugs played is unclear, however. One man died apparently after smoking spiked cigarettes he had been given by inmates who wanted to test a new batch of synthetic cannabis. Another man, whose behaviour had previously been \u201cexemplary\u201d, shouted at a prison doctor, and was found to have hanged himself in his cell the next morning. He had recently developed a heavy synthetic cannabis habit and had been forced to sell possessions to pay off his debts. A woman described as \u201cfun-loving\u201d appeared to have a psychotic episode after taking synthetic cannabis, and possibly other drugs, and died after she severed an artery in an unprecedented act of self-harm. The POA is so concerned about the growing problem that it has begun to compile a dossier on incidents where synthetic cannabis is involved. \u201cWe are looking at various different avenues to make our employer actually wake up and smell the coffee,\u201d said Gillan. \u201cIt\u2019s at a problematic level and worsening.\u201d A prison service spokesperson said governors use sniffer dogs, cell searches and mandatory drugs tests to find drugs in prison and punish those responsible. The service has legislated to make smuggling NPS into prisons illegal. \u201cThose caught trying to throw packages over prison walls can now face up to two years in jail,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cHowever we must do more, which is why we are investing \u00a31.3bn to transform the prison estate, to better support rehabilitation and tackle bullying, violence and drugs.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bernie Sanders acknowledged \u201can uphill climb\u201d ahead of him in the Democratic nomination race on Sunday, but vowed to continue battling against Hillary Clinton despite his diminishing chances of catching her. In a press conference to mark the one-year anniversary of an insurgent campaign that few ever imagined, he also revealed plans for a new series of mega-rallies in California and renewed calls on the party\u2019s handpicked superdelegates to change their allegiances before this summer\u2019s national convention. The Vermont senator conceded that in order for such appeals to make a difference, he would also have to win a majority of the remaining \u201cpledged delegates\u201d, whose votes are fixed according to election results. He would require him to win 65% of those 1,083 in remaining states to have a chance. \u201cThat is admittedly, and I do not deny it for a second, a tough road to climb, but it is not an impossible road to climb and we intend to fight for every vote in front of us and every delegate remaining,\u201d Sanders told reporters. \u201cIt is virtually impossible for Hillary Clinton to reach a majority of convention delegates by June 14, which is the last day a primary will be held, with pledged delegates alone,\u201d he added. \u201cShe will need superdelegates to take her over the top at the convention in Philadelphia. \u201cIn other words the convention will be a contested contest.\u201d Superdelegates are party officials who are not bound to vote according to the results of their state or district. The defiant mood of the remarks at the National Press Club in Washington follow a strong weekend for Sanders. He received a series of backhanded compliments from Barack Obama at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association annual dinner on Saturday and is polling close to Clinton ahead of the Indiana primary on Tuesday. Clinton, in contrast, appears increasingly relaxed about her path to the nomination after a series of strong election wins in Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware on Tuesday, and a blowout win in New York, which all but guarantee she will go to Philadelphia with a majority of delegates. But she was on the receiving end of a number of surprisingly barbed jokes from Obama at Saturday\u2019s dinner and some supporters may be dismayed to see that Sanders is not ready to rally around her yet either. Earlier Sunday, she told CNN: \u201cI certainly look forward to working with Senator Sanders,\u201d and promised \u201ca progressive platform\u201d. \u201cI really welcome his ideas and his supporters\u2019 passion and commitment, because the most important thing for us is for us to win in November,\u201d she added. Sanders vowed to \u201cvigorously compete\u201d in the 10 states remaining before the convention. \u201cWe believe we are in a very strong position to win these remaining contests and we have an excellent chance to win in California, the state with far and away the most number of delegates,\u201d he claimed. And the senator rejected the argument put forward by some in the Clinton campaign that his attacks have weakened her chances of defeating Donald Trump. He claimed instead that he remains the stronger candidate to defeat Republicans. Nonetheless, Sanders\u2019 fundraising has dipped in recent weeks, and he may be counting on the tough talk to galvanize supporters through the campaign\u2019s final few weeks. \u201cThe ideas we are fighting for are the future of the Democratic party and indeed the future of this country,\u201d he said on Sunday, repeating his ambition to go to Philadelphia with a mandate that requires policy shifts from the party \u2013 and Clinton. \u201cI would hope very much that the superdelegates from those states where we have won with big margins respect the wishes of the people of those states,\u201d he urged. \u201cTherefore, it is incumbent on every superdelegate to take a hard and objective look at which candidates stands the better chance of defeating Donald Trump and other Republicans.\u201d",

He would require him to win 65% of those 1,083 in remaining states to have a chance.</p> <p>\u201cThat is admittedly, and I do not deny it for a second, a tough road to climb, but it is not an impossible road to climb and we intend to fight for every vote in front of us and every delegate remaining,\u201d Sanders told reporters.</p> <p>\u201cIt is virtually impossible for Hillary Clinton to reach a majority of convention delegates by June 14, which is the last day a primary will be held, with pledged delegates alone,\u201d he added. \u201cShe will need superdelegates to take her over the top at the convention in Philadelphia.</p> <p>\u201cIn other words the convention will be a contested contest.\u201d</p> <p>Superdelegates are party officials who are not bound to vote according to the results of their state or district.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/24/bernie-sanders-poor-people-dont-vote-primary-losses\">Bernie Sanders explains his primary losses: 'Poor people don't vote'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The defiant mood of the remarks at the National Press Club in Washington follow a strong weekend for Sanders. He received <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/01/obama-takes-aim-at-trump-and-republicans-at-final-correspondents-dinner\">a series of backhanded compliments from Barack Obama</a> at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association annual dinner on Saturday and is polling close to Clinton ahead of the Indiana primary on Tuesday.</p> <p>Clinton, in contrast, appears increasingly relaxed about her path to the nomination after a series of strong election wins in Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware on Tuesday, and a blowout win in New York, which all but guarantee she will go to Philadelphia with a majority of delegates.</p> <p>But she was on the receiving end of a number of surprisingly barbed jokes from Obama at Saturday\u2019s dinner and some supporters may be dismayed to see that Sanders is not ready to rally around her yet either. Earlier Sunday, she told CNN: \u201cI certainly look forward to working with Senator Sanders,\u201d and promised \u201ca progressive platform\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI really welcome his ideas and his supporters\u2019 passion and commitment, because the most important thing for us is for us to win in November,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Sanders vowed to \u201cvigorously compete\u201d in the 10 states remaining before the convention. \u201cWe believe we are in a very strong position to win these remaining contests and we have an excellent chance to win in California, the state with far and away the most number of delegates,\u201d he claimed.</p> <p>And the senator rejected the argument put forward by some in the Clinton campaign that his attacks have weakened her chances of defeating Donald Trump. He claimed instead that he remains the stronger candidate to defeat Republicans.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Sanders\u2019 fundraising has dipped in recent weeks, and he may be counting on the tough talk to galvanize supporters through the campaign\u2019s final few weeks. \u201cThe ideas we are fighting for are the future of the Democratic party and indeed the future of this country,\u201d he said on Sunday, repeating his ambition to go to Philadelphia with a mandate that requires policy shifts from the party \u2013 and Clinton.</p> <p>\u201cI would hope very much that the superdelegates from those states where we have won with big margins respect the wishes of the people of those states,\u201d he urged.</p> <p>\u201cTherefore, it is incumbent on every superdelegate to take a hard and objective look at which candidates stands the better chance of defeating Donald Trump and other Republicans.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Three people in a motorised canoe on the mighty River Santiago in Peru\u2019s northern Amazon some weeks ago saw something deeply alarming. It was one dredge and between 15 and 20 men mining for gold up one left-bank tributary. Two of the people in the canoe were consultants for Lima-based NGO DAR, which has dubbed the River Santiago Peru\u2019s \u201clast frontier\u201d for illegal mining. \u201cIn the Amazon gold extraction is only known about in the Madre de Dios and Puno regions in the south of the country,\u201d Esteban Valle Riestra, one of DAR\u2019s consultants, told the Guardian. \u201cThe shift to the north, where in the Santiago basin it started within the last three years, is something new.\u201d Valle Riestra and a DAR colleague were guided by indigenous Awaj\u00fan man Edgar Montenegro D\u00e1vila, whose brother, Edwin, is president of the regional indigenous organization, ORPIAN-P. Edwin told the Guardian that the miners have been knocking down trees, destroying river-banks and putting mercury into the water - effectively putting an end to what was until recently a healthy river or stream he calls the Pastazio or Pastacillo. Montenegro says that ultimately 70,000 indigenous Awaj\u00fans and Wamp\u00eds are at risk from such mining operations because of the impacts on the forests, biodiversity and rivers, which they depend on for their lives and livelihoods. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we want mining in this region?\u201d Montenegro asks. \u201cOne, because the indigenous population don\u2019t have running water. Our way of washing is using the river, the streams, and we drink from them too. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we can\u2019t allow mining. [The miners] extract gold from the river, they put in the mercury, that\u2019s what the fish drink, and then that\u2019s what we could eat. That\u2019s why there\u2019s so much concern about it. In addition, they\u2019re taking out trees, they\u2019re chopping them down. The biological diversity, flora and fauna. . . All disappearing.\u201d Attitudes in the nearest village, Yutupis, are mixed, according to both Montenegro and DAR\u2019s other consultant on the trip, Claudia Ramirez Farro. The latter says some people are concerned about the contamination and the direct impacts it will have on their environment and lives, noting the mercury \u201ccontaminates their rivers, it contaminates the fish and therefore it contaminates them and their children, not just because they consume the fish, but because it\u2019s a common practice for the children to bathe in the rivers.\u201d But others, Ramirez Farro told the Guardian, are \u201cindifferent.\u201d While understanding that the mining contaminates the environment, she says they want to benefit in some way from the mineral deposits in their territories, either by working directly for the miners or in some other gold supply chain capacity. \u201cIn order to understand this complex situation it must be taken into account that these are areas of extreme poverty,\u201d Ramirez Farro says. \u201cMoney is scarce and so illegal activities like logging or mining sometimes happen in indigenous territories with the \u201cpermission\u201d of a particular group that hopes to benefit in some way.\u201d Montenegro agrees that some members of Yutupis are working for the miners, which he says come from Madre de Dios and other areas, and told the Guardian ORPIAN-P is developing long-term alternative livelihood options: fish farms, cacao cultivation and indigenous handicrafts. \u201cI understand the need to work, but we can\u2019t destroy the environment,\u201d he says. According to Montenegro, the miners are operating in a formal mining concession, but without the owner\u2019s permission. He told the Guardian that ORPIAN-P made an official complaint last year which led to Peru\u2019s navy and army entering the zone and destroying 14 dredges, yet operations continue. This, he says, has forced ORPIAN-P to take legal action through the public prosecutor and to make another request, to Peru\u2019s Presidencia del Consejo de Ministros (PCM), to send in more troops and drive out the miners by force. Gold-mining is a major cause of deforestation in Peru\u2019s Amazon. To date, by far the hardest-hit region is Madre de Dios, where whole areas have been transformed into veritable deserts and wastelands. According to a 2015 report by the Ministry of Environment, citing research by the Carnegie Institution for Science in the US, the amount of forest destroyed by gold-mining in Madre de Dios increased by 400% between 1999 and 2012 - from 10,000 hectares to more than 50,000 hectares. Peru is Latin America\u2019s biggest gold producer and one of the top producers worldwide, with the biggest importers being Switzerland, Canada, the US, India and the UK. But are those buying, selling, hoarding, working and wearing it aware of the horrors, in the Amazon alone, involved in extracting it? They should be. Numerous reports by NGOs, academics and media over the last few years have highlighted the appalling impacts and conditions. These include the destruction of forests and river-banks, contamination of rivers by mercury and cyanide, contamination of people, fish and other foods by mercury, indications of forced labour, 10,000s of child workers, prostitution, sexual exploitation of minors, people trafficking, appalling health and safety, numerous fatalities, money laundering, the razing of indigenous peoples\u2019 land, violence and alcoholism. According to a 2015 report by Lima-based NGO Cooperaccion, between US$15 billion worth of gold was produced illegally and/or informally in Peru between 2003 and 2014, meaning an estimated loss of between US$1.4 billion and US$4.9 billion to the Treasury. One report published last month, by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GIATOC), argues that illegal gold-mining in Latin America is increasingly controlled by drugs traffickers and \u201corganized crime\u201d groups. In Peru specifically, the report states that 28% of all gold is illegal, citing research that an estimated 35 tons of contraband gold worth over a US$1 billion made its way to the US and Switzerland in just nine months in 2014, and other research finding that more than 30 tons of mercury are being dumped into Peru\u2019s rivers and lakes every year. The report\u2019s author, Livia Wagner, told the Guardian the links between \u201corganized crime\u201d and illegal gold-mining are far weaker in Peru than Colombia, but that, in Peru, \u201cvery often the miners themselves are being exploited.\u201d One of the report\u2019s case studies is Madre de Dios, where it claims that 1,000s of girls, some as young as 12, are being sexually exploited by the miners. It reads: [Recruiters] make false promises of high wages and of legitimate work in restaurants, but once the victims are transferred to the mining area, their IDs are confiscated and they are told that they have to pay immediately for the clothing, transportation, and lodging that they thought was provided free of charge. If unable to pay, they may have to accept \u201cel pase\u201d (selling their virginity) under threats that their families could be harmed. Expert interviews indicated that new arrivals at the camps, especially virgins, are auctioned off to the highest bidder the first Friday or Saturday after they arrived at the camps. Auctioning off virgin girls. That\u2019s right. Wagner says the prices vary depending on the gold market and other factors. \u201cIt depends on how old they are, from where they are,\u201d Wagner told the Guardian. \u201cThe miners prefer to have white girls. That means from the coast area or from the north. They don\u2019t pay so much for the girls from the Andean region - indigenous communities, darker skin. We didn\u2019t put this in the report because this is something that changes so, so often.\u201d Is this the kind of horror that the River Santiago has coming to it, or will Peru\u2019s government heed ORPIAN-P\u2019s request and remove the miners up the Pastazio or anywhere else they\u2019re not welcome? The Ministry of Energy and Mines told the Guardian it isn\u2019t responsible for illegal mining - only \u201cinformal mining\u201d - and therefore wouldn\u2019t comment on the Pastazio. The PCM and Ministry of Environment did not respond to questions.",

      "bodyText": "An entertainment not for the gluten intolerant, Richard Bean\u2019s Toast is a flour-crusted portrait of a group of men working the weekend shift at a bread factory in the north of England in 1975. This 1999 play, now revived at 59E59\u2019s Brits Off Broadway Festival, was Bean\u2019s first produced play and though it resembles a social realist drama (with a few less successful gestures toward the preternatural), the play also displays the mordant and sometimes cruel humor that defines later work like England People Very Nice and One Man, Two Guvnors. It\u2019s Sunday afternoon and the shift has hardly begun before things start to go wrong. The factory is a man short, and the supervisor, Blakey (Steve Nicolson), is assigned a trainee. The boss has just issued a last-minute order for 3,000 extra loaves and the plant is in danger of imminent closure, with management looking for any excuse to shut it down. In the course of the play, an excuse will, of course, present itself. The situation is somewhat formulaic and so is the plotting, but Bean manages something distinctive, too, giving each of the men a distinctive voice. There\u2019s Nellie (Matthew Kelly), an old-timer who would be lost without the work; Colin (Will Barton), a shop steward with designs on Blakey\u2019s position; Lance (John Wark), the trainee, who seems a few slices short of a loaf; and several others. By showing their rivalry and camaraderie (which includes a puzzling amount of testicle grabbing), Bean humanizes these men without lending their characters or their work any particular dignity. The work itself seems fairly abysmal, which Bean would know, having once toiled in a similar factory. But it may be the best that many of these men \u2013 some older, some with a criminal record, some none too bright \u2013 can get. As Blakey describes the 70-hour work week, Lance asks: \u201cIs that legal?\u201d Blakey replies: \u201cYou get paid.\u201d Eleanor Rhode\u2019s production, which began at the Park Theater before touring, is finely detailed, perhaps too finely. The scurf of flour that coats the break room had a way of creeping up the theater\u2019s center aisle and the factory thrum of Max Pappenheim\u2019s sound design confused at least one patron, who asked an usher to silence the noise. The performances are playful and mostly un-showy and the 70s dress and hairstyles, courtesy costume designer Holly Rose Henshaw, are a slightly repulsive treat. What Bean suggests, without condescension or aggrandizement, is that however unglamorous these tasks may seem, they make up the substance of these men\u2019s lives.

      "body": "<blockquote> <p><br /></p> </blockquote> <p><br /></p> <p>An entertainment not for the gluten intolerant, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/31/toast-review-bread-factory-bean\">Richard Bean\u2019s Toast</a> is a flour-crusted portrait of a group of men working the weekend shift at a bread factory in the north of England in 1975. This 1999 play, now revived at 59E59\u2019s Brits Off Broadway Festival, was Bean\u2019s first produced play and though it resembles a social realist drama (with a few less successful gestures toward the preternatural), the play also displays the mordant and sometimes cruel humor that defines later work like England People Very Nice and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/mar/02/adelaide-festival-2013-one-man-two-guvnors\">One Man, Two Guvnors</a>.</p> <p> It\u2019s Sunday afternoon and the shift has hardly begun before things start to go wrong. The factory is a man short, and the supervisor, Blakey (Steve Nicolson), is assigned a trainee. The boss has just issued a last-minute order for 3,000 extra loaves and the plant is in danger of imminent closure, with management looking for any excuse to shut it down. In the course of the play, an excuse will, of course, present itself.</p> <p> The situation is somewhat formulaic and so is the plotting, but Bean manages something distinctive, too, giving each of the men a distinctive voice. There\u2019s Nellie (Matthew Kelly), an old-timer who would be lost without the work; Colin (Will Barton), a shop steward with designs on Blakey\u2019s position; Lance (John Wark), the trainee, who seems a few slices short of a loaf; and several others. By showing their rivalry and camaraderie (which includes a puzzling amount of testicle grabbing), Bean humanizes these men without lending their characters or their work any particular dignity. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jul/04/british-actors-broadway-rivalry\">Broadway's British invasion: history of a centuries-old transatlantic rivalry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The work itself seems fairly abysmal, which Bean would know, having once toiled in a similar factory. But it may be the best that many of these men \u2013 some older, some with a criminal record, some none too bright \u2013 can get. As Blakey describes the 70-hour work week, Lance asks: \u201cIs that legal?\u201d Blakey replies: \u201cYou get paid.\u201d</p> <p>Eleanor Rhode\u2019s production, which began at the Park Theater before touring, is finely detailed, perhaps too finely. The scurf of flour that coats the break room had a way of creeping up the theater\u2019s center aisle and the factory thrum of Max Pappenheim\u2019s sound design confused at least one patron, who asked an usher to silence the noise. The performances are playful and mostly un-showy and the 70s dress and hairstyles, courtesy costume designer Holly Rose Henshaw, are a slightly repulsive treat. </p> <p>What Bean suggests, without condescension or aggrandizement, is that however unglamorous these tasks may seem, they make up the substance of these men\u2019s lives. At one point, a character calculates that in his 45 years at the plant, Nellie has mixed some 220m loaves, no mean accomplishment. \u201cThat,\u201d he says, \u201cis an awful lot of toast.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this recap assumes you\u2019ve seen the fifth episode of Undercover. Don\u2019t read on if you haven\u2019t. Maya Cobbina, the pinnacle of probity and the most prestigious lawyer in the land, just flashed her boobs at a raving unhinged racist for intel. We know you\u2019re desperate to crack the Michael Antwi case, Maya, but some decorum, please. Aside from Boobgate, we did actually gain a fair whack of essential info in this week\u2019s penultimate episode \u2013 although 94% of us probably gave up caring about Antwi and Rudy Jones and Nasty Nick weeks ago. We learned that the raving racist Peter Mackie (in a brilliantly deviant turn by Ian Peck) was ordered by \u201cthe CIA\u201d to kill Antwi; that Antwi actually died from positional asphyxiation after being held down by the police, who took his struggle as resistance rather than a lack of oxygen \u2013 a scene with sinister echoes of Eric Garner. We learned that Trimble was the police officer who put Antwi in the cell with Mackie \u2013 though the man Maya should be going after is of course our mystery Scotsman, who has masterminded the 20-year cover-up. We learned that undercover cop Nick and Maya\u2019s life together seems as good as over, after she threw down the gauntlet (in one of a string of strong bedroom-bound two-handers) and called him a rapist who stole a dead child\u2019s identity and her entire life \u2013 fair assessments all. Nick\u2019s also being tailed by Julia\u2019s hardy journo sidekick Alex Brady, the only person who seems capable of blowing this whole thing open. And in case we hadn\u2019t gathered already, Maya twigs that the cases in London and Louisiana are (stop the press) connected. So we\u2019re finally getting somewhere, and we know the mystery Scotsman and the minister of justice are into something huge and transatlantic \u2013 but is an hour enough time to reveal all, while still giving us a passably tense series end? Aren\u2019t we being drip-fed too slowly to expect a satisfying conclusion? Indeed, is there anything at this point that could give us one? My main worry is that it\u2019ll be so inconclusive the BBC will have to commit to a second series. Over in Louisiana, where Maya is trying to get Rudy a stay of execution, the wildly unconvincing legal scenes deliver a Bible\u2019s worth of fire and brimstone talk about heaven (\u201cmore beautiful than any one of us can imagine\u201d) and hell (\u201cwhich of us is going to burn?\u201d). Talk, I imagine, we all wish we\u2019d been spared. What happened to the Peter Moffat of Silk? While attempting to get a pardon for Rudy\u2019s life, Maya insisted to the judge that her relationship with him had a language \u201cnever diminished by cliche\u201d \u2013 then talked in a torrent of them (\u201clife is short\u201d, \u201che taught me how to find beauty in an eight-foot cell\u201d) to lay out her case. It was only after we heard the prison guard lie creepily about Rudy being aroused by Maya\u2019s daughter Clem that we realised Rudy\u2019s saviour was sitting right outside. After Clem rushed from the courtroom, she was soothed by Vernon Early \u2013 Rudy\u2019s alibi for the murder of a white politician, who\u2019s come forward at last, after years of police threats, as if by magic. Maya may have lost her appeal \u2013 but, armed with this new ammo, she can go even bigger and take his case before the Supreme Court. Maybe she\u2019ll overturn the whole US constitution in the series finale! Back in London, poor Dan is trying to do seven solid minutes of press-ups. When he fails \u2013 only reaching a downright heroic six and a half minutes \u2026 close, so close! \u2013 he realises his dad\u2019s a liar, follows him to the park, spots him with his handler, feeds the handler intel that gets Vernon Early killed, then meets a girl named Lola who simply must be another copper. His chat-up line (\u201cYou\u2019re white, really white\u201d) was especially sweet. Please don\u2019t break his heart, you undercover bint. \u2018Go big\u2019 speech of the week Maya brings out the big guns to Nick: \u201cYou\u2019re still doing it aren\u2019t you? You tell them everything and you tell me nothing. You have chosen. What kind of monster are you?\u201d Cue Nick trying to prove his true love for her by rushing downstairs, grabbing his dad\u2019s ashes from the kitchen cupboard and shaking them in her face while weeping. Notes and observations \u2022 Why did the minister of justice pick his pen up off the floor in such a bizarre way? And why are these the things my mind dwells on when it should be fixated on the storylines? \u2022 Why did Maya not go home from the airport with Clem to drop her bags off before she schlepped round Highgate Cemetery to find Nicholas Johnson\u2019s gravestone? And Nick \u2013 if you\u2019re going to steal someone\u2019s identity, don\u2019t pick a grave so close to the path. Go a few rows deep at least. \u2022 Bless Trimble for having a VHS player at the ready to show Maya the only remaining tape of the day Antwi died. Why didn\u2019t she visit him, or Rose, or Mackie, years ago? What\u2019s been the hold-up? \u2022 At last, someone calls Maya out on her driving! And yet \u2026 she does it anyway. \u2022 So Lola is the \u201cinsurance policy\u201d that our mystery Scotsman has taken out on the whole Johnson family. What could this mean? Is she a ninja assassin who\u2019s going to have sex with Dan then butcher the bunch of them? \u2022 Nick\u2019s even less convincing as a writer than we all thought if his prewritten and rehearsed lines to keep his wife are: \u201cNobody can know the truth\u201d and \u201cI have looked into the smiling faces of our kids and been terrified that they would find out.\u201d \u2022 If Maya\u2019s old boyfriend Big Ray turns out to be the crux of this whole thing, I\u2019m writing a letter of complaint. \u2022 Ditto if Clem falls in love with the anti death-penalty man Mark and moves to America. \u2022 I couldn\u2019t believe Nick swore on both Rocco the dog and his own son\u2019s life that he\u2019d never lied about anything else. This was never going to end well for Dan. \u2022 A great pay-off line from Maya about the shock death of Vernon Early: \u201cYou did this. Who\u2019s next, Nick?\u201d Who\u2019s your money on for the finale? If Dan doesn\u2019t make it out alive, it will make me miffed above all else.",

Don\u2019t wait, Alice! Have a row about rickshaws and get out of there! And of course the inevitable happens and Evil Charlie wins again. My heart was in my mouth. And who was looking after Percy? Did he run into the street? I don\u2019t know if I can wait a whole week to find out what happens next \u2013 and I do not usually feel this way. Damn you, Channel 4, for pulling it out of the bag for Indian Summers so late! As Alice put it in the opening scenes: \u201cThis whole adventure will come crashing down before long ...\u201d we\u2019re on a countdown now. Two more episodes to go and then we\u2019re done. And not just done, but properly done: Channel 4 has not renewed the contract, despite the fact that this was due to go to five series. It\u2019s probably the right decision because, despite all indications to the contrary in tonight\u2019s heart-stopper, this series has lost momentum. But it is a shame, especially when the high points of Indian Summers really are sublime. Before all the health-threatening action, though, a veritable festival of suspense was unleashed here, all trembling clutch bags, secret notes and meaningful glances ahead of Aafrin and Alice\u2019s elopement. We moved swiftly away from the slapstick feel of last week\u2019s multi-Sooni-proposal and into far more dangerous territory. Even Mr Ian was morphing into a bit of an Evil Charlie by the end. There was a more laidback feel early on as Mr Ian laid on a feast for Sooni and did his hair and everything. But it soon soured and all went black. Can Mr Ian pull in front of Mr Khan? Of course he can\u2019t. How fond I have grown of Sooni, though, and her beautifully kohl\u2019d eyes. \u201cYe cannae wish it into life if it\u2019s no there.\u201d The best was yet to come. Mr Khan: \u201cDon\u2019t despair, Mr Ian. You will love again.\u201d This was my favourite scene ever. \u201cPlease. God ... No ... With him? You? Right from under my nose. You sneaky, ink-stained lothario.\u201d Poor Mr Ian. And, of course, now Sooni says yes to Mr Khan! Hurrah! But will he survive her pebble-encrusted cooking? Unsurprisingly, however, her parents are set on Eyebrow Man (because they don\u2019t know that their problems are about to get a million times worse as Evil Charlie locks Aafrin in the Secret Love Room of Doom). \u201cMr Khan? From The Simla Times?\u201d \u201cBut he\u2019s a Muslim!\u201d I loved that Sooni\u2019s mother was most concerned about the fasting and the stupid food. And they don\u2019t even know what Aafrin is planning ... \u201cYou would kill your poor mother for sure.\u201d Well, don\u2019t worry about that because Evil Charlie will kill everyone in the whole of India first. Political shenanigans Ralphie\u2019s plan to take his place in history as the man who made progress in India lies in tatters. \u201cWe had a deal. We made an agreement.\u201d The pet maharajah has buggered off to Baden-Baden and now there is no one left to vote for the bill. And now Ralphie blames Madeleine for the maharajah sex not being good enough. Madeleine, however, has turned out to be a lot cooler than I thought, supporting Alice and shrugging off the theft of the maharajah\u2019s mother\u2019s statement necklace. Madeleine is unflappable, unreadable and a born diplomat. She was the one who was prepared to put out for a man in a dodgy earring to save the Empire. That is true sacrifice. It would be better if Madeleine were the Viceroy. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything but maybe that will be the final twist at the end of this series? There were various pointless bits of exposition justifying Sarah still being in the country. (Not that I mind. I like Sarah \u2013 more than she likes herself.) \u201cNobody knows who put that thing there. But we\u2019re going to find them. And when we do, we\u2019ll show them we\u2019re not afraid.\u201d Well, it\u2019s all too late for that because the bomb was laid by Bonkers Naresh and he has gone to meet The Adulterous Schoolteacher in the sky. No one misses them. Evil Britisher of the week It\u2019s hard to find words for Charlie\u2019s evilness this week, but let\u2019s just say that he\u2019s back on form. And his fingers are capable of destroying more than a tune on a banjo. First, though, he was at pains to humiliate Ralphie with a reminder of who works at the bank. \u201cWilson Hutchinson has asked that you settle your account ... It\u2019s four hundred thousand.\u201d Woah! \u201cWhat a pickle.\u201d And the face before the handshake! Blake Ritson, you are the best. I became very concerned that he would murder Alice before she had a chance to run away. And then he would murder Cynthia too for helping. But he has another two episodes in which to effect all that. I think he will do it slowly and with a twirl of his moustache. The Julie Walters Fan Club \u201cSome local hero has hoisted the Indian flag in the middle of Cynthia\u2019s lawn.\u201d Soon replaced with the Union Jack and a rousing rendition of Jerusalem. Bravo, Cynthia! And here she was back on top. \u201cEverybody knows me and I know everybody.\u201d How on earth did Cynthia find out about Alice\u2019s tickets? She really is the Derren Brown of Simla. I am hoping Cynthia will be the secret weapon in the fight against Evil Charlie which is surely going to be the set piece for the end of this series. Who cares about the fate of India now that Evil Charlie will have everyone in his sights? He\u2019s a psychopath when he\u2019s in a good mood. I dread to think what he\u2019ll do now that he\u2019s got good reason. If I were Cynthia, I\u2019d burn down the club before Charlie gets there ...",

      "bodyText": "Bristol Rovers went beyond the call of duty at York. Darrell Clarke, their manager, warned them against underestimating City, whose relegation from League Two was confirmed the previous week. The fear was of dead men walking free from anxiety. By the end York were staggering. Rovers showed neither complacency nor compassion in a 4-1 victory Clarke called \u201coutstanding\u201d. Little good it did them immediately except to keep up the pressure on Accrington and Oxford in the second and third automatic promotion places, who both also won away. But it carries the tension and hope of avoiding the play-offs into the last game on Saturday. They have to win but, if they do, so must the others to stop them displacing one or other. Theirs is at home to Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, the other relegated side. Two years ago Clarke, newly in post, failed to get the draw on the last day that would have kept Rovers in the league. A year ago, having finished second in the Conference, they came up again. No one will want them in the play-offs, if it comes to that rather than the short cut. \u201cWe\u2019re the chasing team. The others will be nervous,\u201d Clarke said of Saturday. \u201cIt will be a real special day.\u201d Their fans so easily filled the 2,000 allocation of tickets for Bootham Crescent that a live beam-back to the Memorial Stadium was allowed, with tickets for that sold out in 24 hours. Clarke, though, was entitled to sound a warning about York, unbeaten in five games at home and whose one win in 14 games was over Portsmouth, and he was delighted with his side\u2019s confident display, with Tom Lockyer commanding in defence and Chris Lines rampaging in midfield. \u201cWe played on the front foot,\u201d he said. They have been on it for a couple of months. This was their 10th win in 13 games, with only one defeat. Billy Bodin, wide on the right, beat Scott Flinders at the near post inside 20 minutes before Matty Taylor, the division\u2019s leading scorer with 27, surprisingly shot wide when Dave Winfield, whose player-of-the-season trophy may have gone to his head, let him through one on one. Bodin reminded him how to do it from a similar mishap after 70 minutes. When Taylor, having stretched for a cross and redemption, was taken off holding his leg, his replacement, Jermaine Easter, scored in a minute after neat play by another substitute, Jake Gosling. Rovers have strength in depth. Kenny McEvoy\u2019s instant response to that was less consolation than a wave from the grave and Lee Mansell capped it with Rovers\u2019 fourth. Understandably the ground has no scoreboard. York, honest but hapless, looked beaten long before the end, if not before the start. None of them got a cheer as the team were read out. As home supporters shuffled away to the National League, as it now is, one muttered: \u201cWe saved the worst to last. Abysmal.\u201d That is how the fifth tier is seen: the abyss. Some blamed the owner, some the manager, some the players. \u201cWell, it gives us something to argue about,\u201d said his companion. Everyone from chairman to chaplain had a say in the programme which, with only one home cup game, had to complete its alphabet with X, Y and Z in one issue. Its final item was Y for St\u00e9phane Zubar. It somehow foreshadowed their play. Jason McGill, the chairman, took \u201cfull responsibility for making the key decisions\u201d but felt let down by \u201cmany of the players\u2019 lack of character when the going became tough\u201d and recently those whose \u201cbehaviour became public on social media\u201d, confirming that social media is an irresistible temptation for idiots to expose their idiocy. The manager, Jackie McNamara, who came in November, said recruitment was already under way for \u201cplayers with the right attitude mixed in with ability and a mindset that will fight to the end\u201d. He, like Clarke, looks set to stay for an instant return. The Rev Paul Deo (by God) urged fans to back the club\u2019s committed staff with \u201cKeep the faith\u201d and there are grounds for it in Rovers\u2019 example, as in Cheltenham\u2019s with Gary Johnson. Besides, they have been here before, spending eight years down before returning for four and reaching the League Two play-offs in 2014. Meanwhile Rovers\u2019 final opponents have scored six goals in winning their last two games and climbing above York. Clarke\u2019s Pirates face dead men flying.",

      "bodyText": "For a game that can turn on such tiny moments it is remarkable how often football delivers the fitting result. It\u2019s no slight on Western Sydney Wanderers\u2019 impressive season to state that in this year\u2019s A-League grand final the better team won; and so for the seventh time in 11 years the team that finished premiers has added the descriptor \u201cchampions\u201d as well. The post-game cardboard standee and party popper celebrations may have been underwhelming, but there was nothing lacklustre about Adelaide United\u2019s on-field performance. It may not have been the tense, testy affair that so often characterises finals, but all four goals spoke volumes as to the calibre of this Adelaide team. Marcelo Carrusca and Bruce Kamau\u2019s combination for the opener was inspired; Isaias\u2019s free-kick was inch-perfect; and Pablo Sanchez\u2019s cool finish was ruthless in exposing a rare Wanderers defensive lapse. Even Scott Neville\u2019s belter seemed to highlight the quality it would require to breach Eugene Galekovic\u2019s goal. If the Wanderers appeared to fall short of the captivating semi-final showing against Brisbane, then the obverse side to this was the impressive strength of Adelaide defensively. Whereas United dissected Western Sydney with the clinical precision of a scalpel, the Wanderers\u2019 response was that of a tooth-worn hacksaw. Romeo Castelen, for all his mercurial talent, is often guilty of inconsistency, but he was in good company as Mark Bridge delivered a quiet performance and Mitch Nichols suffered the ignominy of being withdrawn before even an hour had passed. These are quality players \u2013 as Brisbane can attest \u2013 and they don\u2019t lose their ability overnight. If Western Sydney\u2019s attack was blunt, then it was the grit of Adelaide\u2019s collective defensive structure that caused this. How many times did Castelen find himself with two markers? How often did we see him receive the ball in dangerous central positions? Much has been made of Guillermo Amor\u2019s links to the fabled Barcelona school of attacking football, but it has been defensively that Adelaide has most improved. No coach in Reds\u2019 history can boast a record of almost one goal conceded per game; and if you consider Adelaide shipped 17 in their first eight games, the turnaround thereafter is even more remarkable. Seven clean sheets away from home, and 13 in all \u2013 just one shy of the all-time A-League record \u2013 mean that in almost half Adelaide\u2019s games this season oppositions have gone home empty-handed. To do so with world-class players is the sign of a decent manager; to do so with no better than decent players is the hallmark of a world-class coach. Adelaide\u2019s season has not been defined by a Diego Castro or a Bruno Fornaroli. It\u2019s been defined by a striker maligned for his limited goal return, now in career best form; by a defensive-midfielder released by his old club, now reimagined as a reliable central defender; by two full-backs whose youthful promise threatened to dissipate into mediocrity, who are now commanding the attention once again of overseas clubs. In addition to revitalising some of their more mature players, the Adelaide coaching staff has also led the league in developing young talent. Isaias may have won the Joe Marston Medal for best on ground, but it was the 20-year-old Stefan Mauk alongside him in Adelaide\u2019s engine room who is emerging as one of the A-League\u2019s best young talents. When James Jeggo\u2019s mid-season departure left a gaping hole in Adelaide\u2019s midfield, Amor didn\u2019t panic \u2013 he didn\u2019t rush out and sign a veteran on a short-term contract, but instead showed faith in teenager George Mells, before Mauk made the role his own. To back and to develop young players takes faith from a coach; but it also takes faith from a board. Gone are the days when behind-the-scenes disarray prompted then coach Aurelio Vidmar to predict the club would \u201cnever win anything\u201d; now in his captain\u2019s acceptance speech, the very first people thanked by Galekovic were the members of the board. There\u2019s a sense of coherence surrounding Adelaide these days, in its footballing philosophy and in its identity as a club, that speaks to the patient long-term planning so often lacking in increasingly results-driven football. Amor\u2019s philosophies may have altered subtly from Josep Gombau\u2019s but there\u2019s an underlying continuity to the Adelaide project that enables the playing personnel to continue to adapt and to develop. In Gombau and Amor are two coaches who place a premium on encouraging their players to think for themselves on the field. For A-League fans who have witnessed a production line of cookie-cutter replica full-backs; young wingers or strikers, coached within an inch of their lives in tactical formations, patterns of movement or passing, the Adelaide model is a much-needed breath of fresh air. It was fitting that Kamau scored Adelaide\u2019s opener \u2013 a goal that showcased not just his emerging talent, but also his increasing intelligence as a footballer. Watching live, Wanderers fans may have questioned the defending from Scott Jamieson, allowing his winger to sneak inside him so easily. But seen in replay, it\u2019s not a case of ball-watching \u2013 the left-back, selected in the PFA team of the year, is constantly scanning for the youngster\u2019s run; but Kamau patiently waits and times his run for when the defender is wrong-footed, enabling him to gain a metre and attack the space in front of Jamieson. It\u2019s a minor detail, but just one of the many that combined to deliver an inaugural championship for Adelaide. It\u2019s not quite Das Reboot, but for any A-League club struggling to define its identity, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to take notes from Adelaide\u2019s patient revolution",

    "webTitle": "Ted Cruz rails against Trump-Clinton 'cartel' in final push ahead of Indiana", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ted Cruz made a last-ditch series of attacks on Donald Trump on Sunday, going so far as to call him corrupt, dismiss fellow Republicans, and invoke Trump\u2019s endorsement by \u201ca convicted rapist\u201d as he argued that his chances are not in fact dwindling in the Republican presidential primary. Cruz blitzed television airwaves on Sunday morning, making appearances on five talkshows and doing everything in his power to undermine Trump. He admitted Indiana was \u201cimportant\u201d to his campaign\u2019s hopes, but doggedly refused to consider the possibility that Trump could secure the nomination. \u201cNo one is going to clinch it on the first ballot. I\u2019m not and Donald Trump is not either,\u201d he told the ABC show This Week. \u201cIt\u2019s why Donald Trump is so desperate to say it\u2019s over now,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a contested convention.\u201d But a new opinion poll published on Sunday suggested Cruz is the candidate in dire need of a boost. The NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll showed him behind Trump in Indiana by 15 points, 49% to 34%, with 13% for Ohio governor John Kasich, the third candidate in the race. Poll averages show Trump ahead of Cruz by seven points in the state, which is one of the few yet to vote that could keep Trump from clinching the nomination. The stakes are high for Cruz. The senator is already mathematically unable to secure 1,237 delegates needed on the first ballot of the Republican convention, and all his hopes rest on preventing Trump from doing the same. Trump needs 282 pledged delegates, and Indiana and California are the two major states where Cruz has any hope of a major victory. The math did not deter Cruz from trying every rhetorical tool at hand to counter Trump. He insisted that the businessman is a liberal, and \u201cflip-sides of the same coin\u201d with the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton. Trump\u2019s tariff proposals would \u201cdrive jobs overseas\u201d, Cruz argued to NBC, adding that Trump\u2019s foreign policy would leave the world without leadership. Not content to criticize the substance of Trump\u2019s ideas, he accused Trump and Clinton of being agents of a corrupt system. \u201cThey\u2019ve both gotten rich exploiting Washington, exploiting government power,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. On two other shows, he called the pair \u201cenmeshed in corruption\u201d, \u201cultimate Washington insiders\u201d and members of a political \u201ccartel\u201d. He also abandoned the appeals to unity that he had tried to make in hopes of bringing moderate conservatives to his cause. He pointedly dismissed criticisms from other Republicans, namely from John Boehner, a longtime Republican leader and former speaker of the House, who earlier this week said Cruz was \u201cLucifer in the flesh\u201d. \u201cI kind of wondered if Boehner was auditioning to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice-president,\u201d Cruz told CBS. \u201cYou know, a Trump-Boehner ticket would really say the Washington cartel in all its force.\u201d He was bolstered by at least one peer, however: South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who readily admitted that \u201ccivil war\u201d had broken out in the Republican party. \u201cLucifer may be the only person Donald Trump could beat in a general election,\u201d he joked to CBS. \u201cBut when it comes women and Hispanics, Trump polls like Lucifer.\u201d But Graham grew serious when asked about Trump\u2019s foreign policy, which he described as dangerous isolationism: \u201cIt will lead to another 9/11.\u201d Finally, Cruz rebuked the businessman for the company he keeps. He noted that former boxer Mike Tyson had endorsed Trump this week, and alluded to Tyson\u2019s 1992 rape conviction in Indiana. \u201cYou know, all the tough guys endorse me,\u201d Trump said earlier this week. \u201cI like that.\u201d Cruz rejected the endorsement: \u201cI don\u2019t think rapists are tough guys. I think they are weak. They\u2019re bullies and cowards. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a bully,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t need someone who yells and screams and insults.\u201d Campaigning in Indiana, Trump waved off the criticisms as annoyances, and mocked the men and Kasich at length. \u201cI refuse to call them the leftovers. It\u2019s not respectful,\u201d he said, before miming the look of a man clinging to the edge of a cliff. \u201cThe two guys that are hanging by their fingernails. \u2018Don\u2019t let me fall! Don\u2019t let me fall!\u2019\u201d At a rally in Terre Haute, he said that he was already looking forward to the general election. \u201cIf we win in Indiana, it\u2019s all over,\u201d he promised. \u201cAnd then we can focus on \u2018Crooked Hillary\u2019, please.\u201d Earlier in the day, Trump did just that, telling Fox News Sunday that Clinton was playing \u201cthe woman card\u201d and that \u201ceven women don\u2019t like her\u201d. He has for months accused Clinton of being a novelty candidate, although polling consistently shows that he is strongly disliked by most American women. And although Cruz recited a litany of attacks on Trump, he refused to say he would not support the businessman should Trump win the nomination. NBC host Chuck Todd asked Cruz nine times whether he could conceivably support Trump. The senator spoke at length in reply, but did not give a simple yes or no.",

He admitted Indiana was \u201cimportant\u201d to his campaign\u2019s hopes, but doggedly refused to consider the possibility that Trump could secure the nomination.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/30/trump-cruz-indiana-republican-primary-delegates-needed\">Indiana is the only place that can save the GOP from a Trump takeover</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNo one is going to clinch it on the first ballot. I\u2019m not and Donald Trump is not either,\u201d he told the ABC show This Week. \u201cIt\u2019s why Donald Trump is so desperate to say it\u2019s over now,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a contested convention.\u201d</p> <p>But a new opinion poll published on Sunday suggested Cruz is the candidate in dire need of a boost. The <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/donald-trump-leads-cruz-15-points-crucial-indiana-race-n565356\">NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist</a> poll showed him behind Trump in Indiana by 15 points, 49% to 34%, with 13% for Ohio governor John Kasich, the third candidate in the race. Poll <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-indiana-presidential-republican-primary\">averages</a> show Trump ahead of Cruz by seven points in the state, which is one of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/30/trump-cruz-indiana-republican-primary-delegates-needed\">few yet to vote</a> that could keep Trump from clinching the nomination.</p> <p>The stakes are high for Cruz. The senator is already <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/gop-primaries/276975-ap-declares-cruz-mathematically-eliminated-from-first-ballot\">mathematically unable</a> to secure 1,237 delegates needed on the first ballot of the Republican convention, and all his hopes rest on preventing Trump from doing the same. Trump needs 282 pledged delegates, and Indiana and California are the two major states where Cruz has any hope of a major victory.</p> <p>The math did not deter Cruz from trying every rhetorical tool at hand to counter Trump. He insisted that the businessman is a liberal, and \u201cflip-sides of the same coin\u201d with the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton. Trump\u2019s tariff proposals would \u201cdrive jobs overseas\u201d, Cruz argued to NBC, adding that Trump\u2019s foreign policy would leave the world without leadership.</p> <p>Not content to criticize the substance of Trump\u2019s ideas, he accused Trump and Clinton of being agents of a corrupt system. \u201cThey\u2019ve both gotten rich exploiting Washington, exploiting government power,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.</p> <p>On two other shows, he called the pair \u201cenmeshed in corruption\u201d, \u201cultimate Washington insiders\u201d and members of a political \u201ccartel\u201d. </p> <p>He also abandoned the appeals to unity that he had tried to make in hopes of bringing moderate conservatives to his cause. He pointedly dismissed criticisms from other Republicans, namely from John Boehner, a longtime Republican leader and former speaker of the House, who earlier this week said Cruz was \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/apr/28/boehner-lucifer-cruz-kasich-alliance-trump-women-caitlyn-jenner-election-2016\">Lucifer in the flesh</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI kind of wondered if Boehner was auditioning to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice-president,\u201d Cruz told CBS. \u201cYou know, a Trump-Boehner ticket would really say the Washington cartel in all its force.\u201d<br /></p> <p>He was bolstered by at least one peer, however: South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who readily admitted that \u201ccivil war\u201d had broken out in the Republican party.</p> <p>\u201cLucifer may be the only person Donald Trump could beat in a general election,\u201d he joked to CBS. \u201cBut when it comes women and Hispanics, Trump polls like Lucifer.\u201d</p> <p>But Graham grew serious when asked about Trump\u2019s foreign policy, which he described as dangerous isolationism: \u201cIt will lead to another 9/11.\u201d </p> <p>Finally, Cruz rebuked the businessman for the company he keeps. He noted that former boxer Mike Tyson had endorsed Trump this week, and alluded to Tyson\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/27/sports/tyson-gets-6-year-prison-term-for-rape-conviction-in-indiana.html?pagewanted=all\">1992 rape conviction in Indiana</a>. </p> <p> \u201cYou know, all the tough guys endorse me,\u201d Trump said earlier this week. \u201cI like that.\u201d</p> <p>Cruz rejected the endorsement: \u201cI don\u2019t think rapists are tough guys. I think they are weak. They\u2019re bullies and cowards. </p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need a bully,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t need someone who yells and screams and insults.\u201d </p> <p>Campaigning in Indiana, Trump waved off the criticisms as annoyances, and mocked the men and Kasich at length. </p> <p>\u201cI refuse to call them the leftovers. It\u2019s not respectful,\u201d he said, before miming the look of a man clinging to the edge of a cliff. \u201cThe two guys that are hanging by their fingernails. \u2018Don\u2019t let me fall! Don\u2019t let me fall!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>At a rally in Terre Haute, he said that he was already looking forward to the general election. \u201cIf we win in Indiana, it\u2019s all over,\u201d he promised. \u201cAnd then we can focus on \u2018Crooked Hillary\u2019, please.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Trump did just that, telling Fox News Sunday that Clinton was playing \u201cthe woman card\u201d and that \u201ceven women don\u2019t like her\u201d. He has for months accused Clinton of being a novelty candidate, although polling consistently shows that he is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/190403/seven-women-unfavorable-opinion-trump.aspx\">strongly disliked</a> by most American women.</p> <p>And although Cruz recited a litany of attacks on Trump, he refused to say he would not support the businessman should Trump win the nomination. NBC host Chuck Todd asked Cruz nine times whether he could conceivably support Trump. The senator spoke at length in reply, but did not give a simple yes or no.</p> <p><br /></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Corporate wrongdoing has become endemic in Australia, with hundreds of cases being pursued by the country\u2019s regulators each year, and with few signs of their workloads lightening, a new report has found. But there are also fewer regulators \u201cpatrolling the corporate beat\u201d in Australia than there were three years ago, with government agencies that monitor corporate malfeasance having their staffing cut by 3,926 people in total \u2013 or 14.9% \u2013 since the 2013-14 budget. The left-leaning think-tank the Australia Institute has released a new report, called Corporate Malfeasance in Australia, that shows the extent of wrongdoing in the country\u2019s corporate sector. It calls on the Turnbull government to restore staffing budgets and resources for key agencies such as the Australian Tax Office (ATO) and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic), among others, to combat the problem. It comes two weeks after the government promised to restore funding to Asic by forcing Australia\u2019s banks to pay for a multimillion-dollar upgrade to Asic\u2019s surveillance systems \u2013 a move designed to help the regulator improve its ability to thwart corporate wrongdoing, much diminished by a $120m funding cut in the Abbott government\u2019s 2014 budget. There is no database in Australia that gives a complete view of the corporate sector\u2019s wrongdoing, and the AI report is an attempt to address that information gap, it says. The report surveys data published by Asic, the ATO, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), Fair Work Ombudsman, Fair Work Commission, and Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), in some cases stretching back a decade. \u201cThe extent of wrongdoing among Australian companies and businesses is surprisingly high,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe publications of official agencies demonstrates that malfeasance by the private sector is widespread.\u201d The report shows Asic has concluded 3,115 cases against corporations over the last four-and-a-half years, of which 2,095 were criminal matters. It took action against building and construction firms in 10,667 cases, over the last five years. The report says: \u201cThis is unlikely to represent the full extent of non-compliance by corporations with relevant legal requirements because Asic, like most regulators, has limited resources and a reluctance to take formal proceedings unless there is a very high prospect of success\u201d. The report shows the ATO has been prosecuting an average of 450 companies a year since 2011-12, but that number fell to 300 in 2014-15, \u201cpossibly due to the staffing and other resource constraints.\u201d It shows the ATO still recovered $3.5bn in tax in 2014-15 from companies attempting to hide their profits. \u201c[But] companies also try to underpay the GST and other indirect taxes as well as PAYG on behalf of their employees; those amounted to $6.3bn in [2014-15],\u201d it says. The report also shows the ACCC, over the past 10 years, has taken action against companies on 669 instances; the Fair Work Ombudsman, over the nine years for which we have data, recovered $250m for over 174,000 employees and finalised 217,000 separate complaints; in the six years to 2014-15 the Fair Work Commission saw a total of 71,106 claims lodged for unfair dismissal and roughly 80% of those were settled at conciliation. The report\u2019s authors say staffing levels at Australia\u2019s key regulatory agencies have been significantly hit in the past three years. It shows the government has cut Asic\u2019s staff numbers by 14.4% since 2013-14 \u2013 from 1,834 to 1,569. The ATO has had staff numbers cut by 16.1% since 2013-14, from 22,022 to 18,482. The head of Asic, Greg Medcraft, has admitted budget cuts enacted by the Coalition have compromised the corporate watchdog\u2019s ability to engage in proactive investigations. \u201cIt is difficult to understand the rationale for these cuts, given the official publications of the relevant agencies show that corporate wrongdoing is widespread in Australia,\u201d the AI report says. \u201cThe publications of official agencies demonstrates that malfeasance by the private sector is widespread in Australia. The staff and resources needed to reduce this wrongdoing and to enforce corporate and workplace laws must be restored to the relevant regulators and government agencies.\u201d Labor leader Bill Shorten has been calling for a royal commission into the banking and financial services industries to confront the amount of corporate malfeasance in Australia. Shorten says the sector had been rocked by a string of scandals that are \u201cnot isolated and one-off examples\u201d but rather point to systemic problems in the industries.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn will face his first nationwide electoral test this week since sweeping to the leadership of his party on a tide of anger at austerity and disillusionment with identikit politicians. Scotland will choose a new government, all seats in the Welsh assembly will be contested, cities including London and Bristol will elect mayors and 2,743 seats in 124 local councils are up for grabs. Even before the polling stations have opened, Corbyn\u2019s allies are keen to play down the significance of the vote as a barometer of the party\u2019s appeal, and the leader\u2019s ability to project his message to different constituencies up and down the country. Corbyn himself told the Guardian last week: \u201cWe are placing no arbitrary figures on anything and I don\u2019t think anyone else should. They are local elections, there are inevitably local factors, let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d But once the votes are counted, every Labour supporter will have to consider what would constitute success. Steve Fisher, of Oxford University, one of Britain\u2019s foremost election experts, has looked at the claims and counter-claims for the Guardian \u2013 focusing on the local elections \u2013 and says there are three ways of asking that question: 1. What does Labour\u2019s past performance suggest? Opposition parties almost always make gains in local government elections. And 2012, when these seats were last contested, under Ed Miliband, was a good year, when Labour did better than its poll rating at the time would have predicted, gaining seats. Corbyn\u2019s allies are keen to make this point, talking about the \u201chigh-water mark\u201d of 2012. Jon Trickett, Labour\u2019s election co-ordinator, wrote recently: \u201cThe English council seats we are contesting this year were last fought in 2012. The results then were Labour\u2019s best in the local elections since those that took place in 2001 on the same day as Blair\u2019s second landslide election.\u201d Fisher says: \u201cThere\u2019s not much evidence from previous local elections that they should make big gains.\u201d Based on their past performance in opposition, he suggests Labour could end up with roughly the same number of seats as before the poll. Ask the question in this way, and a handful of gains would be an improvement on the average \u2013 but on average, Labour didn\u2019t go on to win the next general election. \u201cSmall losses would not, in the context of 2012, constitute a particularly poor performance, but it certainly wouldn\u2019t be a sign of future general election success.\u201d 2. Is Labour on course to win the next general election? Looking at the number of council seats won or lost alone it will be impossible to say. Having analysed the data on seats won or lost at local elections, and general election performance since the 1970s, Fisher said: \u201cThere is absolutely no discernible, sensible correlation there.\u201d Tony Blair scored the record number of Labour gains, with 1,807 in 1995, but his 1996 tally of 468 gains \u2013 just a year before he stormed into Downing Street \u2013 was easily eclipsed by Michael Foot\u2019s 988 gains in 1981, Neil Kinnock\u2019s 584 in 1991 and the 800-plus gains for Miliband in both 2011 and 2012. \u201cBig gains in local elections are no guarantee of future success,\u201d says Fisher. However, there is a much stronger link between the national equivalent vote (NEV), calculated by the academics Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, and future general election performance. The NEV is an estimate of what percentage of the vote each party would be likely to have won across Britain, had all the seats nationally been up for grabs. Another elections expert, Chris Prosser, of the University of Manchester, has tracked the NEV for local elections against subsequent general election results. He finds that on average, Labour needs something like an 11 percentage point lead on this measure to deliver a poll lead and at least 15 points for a majority. Fisher reckons the current opinion polls \u2013 which are the worst for a Labour opposition going into local elections since 1982 \u2013 suggest this time we may end up with something like a one point lead for the Conservatives. That would put Labour well behind what would be necessary to point the way back to power. It had a six-point lead in 2012. Corbyn\u2019s election strategists argue that the muddying of the two-party system in recent years, with Ukip picking up 4m votes at the last general election, makes speculation along these lines difficult, but after the collapse of the Lib Dem vote Rallings and Thrasher say there are actually more two-way, Labour-Conservative competitions than for most of the past two decades \u2013 and Fisher points out that it is Labour\u2019s lead over the Conservatives, rather than either\u2019s absolute share of the vote, that is the best predictor of which party is most likely to form the next government. 3. Is Labour making progress? Here, the answer is more straightforward. Although Corbyn\u2019s lieutenants stress that 2012 was a vintage year, Fisher says: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say that they\u2019re making progress over the Miliband years if you\u2019re losing seats that he won. It\u2019s easier to agree that if you\u2019re making gains on 2012, then you\u2019re doing pretty well.\u201d Similarly, if Labour makes significant losses in Wales, or slips into third place behind the Tories in Scotland \u2013 where the elections are fought on different voting systems \u2013 it might not tell us much about the road to 2020, but it would be difficult to read as evidence that Corbyn is taking his party in the right direction. That\u2019s where sceptics of the leadership, such as backbench MP Alison McGovern, who said recently that a loss of even a single council would be a \u201cbetrayal\u201d, may feel they have a point.",

    "webTitle": "Bill Shorten memoir sets out Labor leader's manifesto in book similar to Battlelines", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bill Shorten has released his own part-memoir part-manifesto, a book casting his life, career and policies for government as part of Labor\u2019s centrist reforming tradition and in the mould of Bob Hawke\u2019s consensus-driven leadership style. Published Monday as an ebook and next week as a paperback, For The Common Good: Reflections on Australia\u2019s Future, is similar in intent to Tony Abbott\u2019s Battlelines, combining childhood memories and personal reflections with a broad brush description of Shorten\u2019s positioning across the policy spectrum and views about the task of leadership itself. The book, published by Melbourne University Press, seeks to define Shorten\u2019s image ahead of the full force of the election campaign, and recast the thing he is best known for, being a unionist and ALP factional leader, asserting that he has now left factional sparring behind him. The Liberal party has already run ads asserting that Shorten is \u201cnot a leader\u201d because he has \u201ctoo much baggage\u201d from his involvement in the two leadership coups of the Rudd/Gillard years and is \u201ctoo weak to stand up to the unions and the factions\u201d. In his book, Shorten addresses those claims. \u201cFor all of my 31 years in the ALP, I\u2019ve been a moderate,\u201d he insists, in a chapter where he addresses his role in both the plot to overthrow Kevin Rudd for Julia Gillard in 2010 and then to overthrow Julia Gillard for Kevin Rudd in 2013. Of 2010 he says he \u201cformed a strong view only in the last few days before the challenge\u201d and repeats that the change was not adequately explained to the electorate. Of 2013, he says the change was necessary to avoid electoral annihilation and was \u201cvery hard personally\u201d because he was \u201ccloser to Julia than to Kevin\u201d. He then turns to the role of factions in his party more generally, conceding excessive involvement in his \u201cyouth\u201d. \u201cFactions within the Labor party have long attracted bad press, sometimes justifiably so,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it is simplistic, however, to reduce the organisation of a party into factions. Political factions have always been a feature of parliamentary politics. Their basic role is to bring individuals together around a common political purpose ... \u201cExcessive factionalism is damaging to political parties and you will often see it at work in youth wings. I probably indulged in a bit of it in my youth: you tend to imitate the conflict of your elders without quite understanding the basis for it. Labor\u2019s factions work best when they\u2019re a fulcrum for ideas and debates. They operate at their worst when they act as a patronage machine to promote mediocre people. As federal leader I don\u2019t think factionally and I don\u2019t attend faction meetings.\u201d Shorten says he was politicised by Hawke\u2019s ascent to the prime ministership, describing Hawke\u2019s national economic summit from his perspective as a high school student. \u201cWatching it all unfold in the newspapers and then discussing it in class was a thrilling experience for a political nerd like me. Most of all, I was impressed by the consensual way in which Hawke led, his way of bringing people together; of uniting the nation rather than playing groups off against each other; repudiating extreme solutions; and the coming together of employers and workers,\u201d he says. Within pages, he is describing his own leadership style in similar terms, an approach learned, like Hawke, from the working in the trade union movement. \u201cSome people think strong leadership means telling people what they must do or being the smartest person in the room. That\u2019s wasn\u2019t my view as a unionist, and nor is it my view now as Labor leader. Real leadership shows that consensus and negotiation is a sign of strength, not weakness. Real leadership means understanding the minimum and the maximum that people will accept. You go for the maximum, yet always understand the minimum. In every negotiation I have been involved in, I refer to the 90:10 rule\u2014let\u2019s work on the 90% we agree on, not the 10% where we differ. This is the belief I have carried into politics. \u201cAs Labor leader, I still think like an organiser. Whether it\u2019s dealing with the rising influence of vested interests or solving a community-level problem, empowering people is the key. Relationships are crucial: get people to come together, define their position and work from there. Don\u2019t begin with a pure ideological solution. Take account of all viewpoints.\u201d The centrist approach extends to He says he\u2019s \u201cmindful of the drift in recent years of some Labor supporters to the Greens party\u201d but says \u201cLabor will not win those people back by out-Greening the Greens.\u201d Instead he insists the electorate will back \u201cbold ideas\u201d, citing as an example the National Disability Insurance Scheme which he successfully advocated as a junior minister. \u201cThe lesson I take from my involvement in the creation of the NDIS is that substantial policy trumps spin every time and great policy tops personality. In this era of media fragmentation and the 24/7 news cycle, advocating big and complex ideas is more difficult \u2013 and yet more rewarding \u2013 than ever before. Voters will reward a political party that takes them into its trust by arguing the case for practical, achievable, worthwhile change. The NDIS was a relatively expensive, complicated policy. Its realisation shows that people are willing to back bold new ideas if the case is made properly. Much of the book is an exposition of Labor\u2019s policies and beliefs but it contains snippets of information including: \u2022 A fairly blunt assessment of his father, Bill snr, who died of a heart attack in 2000: \u201cMum always said Dad was an intelligent man ... He was street smart and possessed good people skills, but ended up taking refuge in the drink like many men of his generation. Looking back, Dad was probably depressed, but they didn\u2019t have counselling then. When I was 10, the same age he was when his father died, Dad suffered a heart attack. It hurt seeing that. No child should ever have to see their father so vulnerable at that age. Yet it changed him. He stopped drinking as much, which was welcome, although he developed a shorter fuse. Why? I suppose it shocked him \u2013 he was only 47 \u2013 but maybe he was experiencing pain, too. He\u2019d smoked a lot and drunk a lot, to the point that his health was less than wonderful. If you watch old cop shows from the 1970s and see the blokes with big fat ties and the cigarette ash spilling down their jackets, that\u2019s the world my Dad inhabited. This time left an indelible mark upon me. Dad would take my brother and me to the football to see the Swans on Saturdays. He\u2019d be dressed in his big woollen overcoat, park us in the grandstand, and go off to meet his mates and drink beer. I guess for him it was an escape of sorts. It was this lifestyle that contributed to his premature death ... Dad was an old-fashioned father \u2013 he grew up during the Depression after all. I can\u2019t pretend there wasn\u2019t conflict at home. Dad was never physically violent towards Mum, but there were plenty of arguments and, looking back, I can see that a permanent undercurrent of tension persisted in our home life. I don\u2019t want other children to experience that in their formative years. \u2022 That Shorten once considered becoming a social worker: \u201cIt had taken me a while as a kid to work out what I wanted to do. The Jesuits placed an emphasis on community involvement and so I did volunteer work when I was at school. Visiting the kids at St Paul\u2019s School for the Blind and yarning with pensioners on a Friday afternoon was rewarding, so much so that I considered a career as a social worker. I\u2019d also thought about following Dad and going to sea. I toyed with the idea of joining the armed forces and so enlisted with the Army Reserve. I clearly saw appeal in joining an institution that gave meaning and purpose to so many people. In the end, I settled on the law.\u201d \u2022 That he likes German works councils - bodies where employees participate in, or are informed of management decisions: \u201cDuring my time at the AWU I grew to admire works councils, the committees that can be formed to represent all employees at an enterprise. In Germany, the works council model is mandated by law and is especially popular. It has been an important factor in making that nation\u2019s economy dynamic, strong and efficient. It is supported by both sides of politics, along with codetermination, whereby employees are allowed to play a role in the management of the companies they work for, especially large organisations.\u201d \u2022 That if elected, his first overseas visit will be to the Asia\u2013Pacific. \u201cPapua New Guinea and East Timor will be my earliest ports of call.\u201d \u2022 That defence policy would also have a regional focus: \u201cThe priorities of our defence policy should be an enhanced ADF regional presence, increased multinational military exercises, high-profile humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts to assist neighbours in distress, and the Pacific Maritime Security Program, which would build on the success of Kim Beazley\u2019s Pacific Patrol Boats Program.\u201d \u2022 That a Labor government would successfully introduce an ETS this time because it was now seen as a \u201cblue-collar\u201d issue: \u201cI\u2019m convinced that Labor will be able to introduce, implement and bed down an emissions trading scheme when it takes office. That\u2019s because Labor sees climate change action as part of a comprehensive set of policies aimed at renewing and modernising the Australian economy and its workforce. Concern over dealing with climate change is not confined to an inner city, white-collar elite: it is a blue-collar issue too. Australians should not be tricked by threats of \u2018they will take away your job\u2019. Australians are not daunted by the future.\u201d \u2022 That he is prepared to reject the \u201cdole bludger\u2019 meme: \u201cNo one condones the small minority who cheat or bend the rules. Yet it is dishonest and lazy to attack the straw man of a bloated welfare system. Indeed, the word \u2018welfare\u2019 itself is used pejoratively in many parts of our media, and by the Coalition government, as a code word for sloth and waste and undeserved income. This is disappointing not because of the cheap, chest-beating rhetoric masquerading as government policy, or the bullying of people who are often doing it tough\u2014 it\u2019s that the facts tell a very different tale. Australia already has one of the best-targeted systems of social investment in the world. While there is always room for improvement in the way assistance is targeted, it is important to note that Australia spends less on welfare than almost every other advanced country and our system works reasonably well. When those who earn more in a week than people with disabilities or the unemployed or carers will earn in an entire year rail against welfare, it\u2019s hard to take them seriously.\u201d",

Political factions have always been a feature of parliamentary politics. Their basic role is to bring individuals together around a common political purpose ... </p> <p>\u201cExcessive factionalism is damaging to political parties and you will often see it at work in youth wings. I probably indulged in a bit of it in my youth: you tend to imitate the conflict of your elders without quite understanding the basis for it.

      "bodyText": "Last week\u2019s inflation figures showed that prices actually fell on average in the first three months of this year. The figures set off strong speculation that Tuesday will see an interest rate cut from the Reserve Bank. But while low inflation is a sign of a lack of demand in the economy, the latest figures suggest that the treasurer, Scott Morrison, is the one who needs to act, rather than the RBA governor, Glenn Stevens. We currently live in a world of very low inflation \u2013 historically so. We have become so used to low inflation that three months ago annual inflation growth of 1.7% was seen as too high to allow an interest rate cut. In previous years such a level would have been seen as scarily low. Prepare to get scared. The Australian Bureau of Statistics found that in the first three months of this year prices fell by 0.2% (the first such fall since December 2008) and annual inflation came in at a carpet-burning low of 1.3%: Underlying inflation, which is generally seen as the guide for interest rate decisions, also recorded very weak results. In the March quarter the two measures of underlying inflation \u2013 the trimmed mean and the weighted median rose \u2013 by just 0.2% and 0.1% respectively: This saw the weighted median recording a record low annual growth of 1.4% and the trimmed mean tying its record low of 1.7%: However you want to cut it, inflation growth is near enough to \u201cbugger all\u201d to call it thus without risking serious error. The market reacted swiftly. On Monday the futures market was pricing in a 16% chance of a rate cut tomorrow; by the end of trading on Tuesday it was rated a 53% chance, by Friday it was 58%: The market now fully expects a rate cut by August and a 50% chance of another cut to 1.5% by February next year. A big reason for the deflation in the March quarter was petrol. Falling oil prices in January and February saw automotive fuel prices drop 10% in the March quarter \u2013 the sixth-largest fall in a quarter since the ABS started recording fuel prices in 1972: Since February, however, oil prices have been rising slowly, so it is likely that the June quarter will see fuel prices rising on average. But fuel wasn\u2019t the biggest fall in the quarter \u2013 that title went to fruit, which fell 11.1%. Although the fall was less when seasonally adjusted, even on that measure it was the second biggest fall. Fruit, like automotive fuel, is classed as a \u201ctradeable\u201d item \u2013 one that has its price determined significantly outside our borders \u2013 and it was such items that really drove the fall in inflation. Tradable items fell 1.4% in the March quarter \u2013 the biggest fall since December 2008: But over the past year it is non-tradable items that are showing record weak growth. In the past 12 months the price of non-tradables items (such as takeway food, rents, utilities charges, house prices, health and education expenses) increased by just 1.7% - the lowest this century: This low price growth of such goods and services really reflects the lack of demand in the economy and why many expect the RBA to cut rates. But should the RBA do it? Over the past few years one key aspect of the government\u2019s budget strategy is the decided lack of interest in stimulating demand in the economy. Essentially Joe Hockey hoped the private sector with the assistance of low interest rates would do the job. But thus far there is little sign of that strategy working. The latest producer price figures released on Friday showed domestic final demand (excluding exports) fell by 0.2% in the March quarter and the annual growth of just 0.8% is a level usually associated with recessions. The December mid-year fiscal and economic outlook revised up the level of growth of public demand for this year to 2.0% from the 1.5% expected in last year\u2019s budget. But it made no change for 2016-17: A key measure to look for in Tuesday\u2019s budget is whether or not the government is to increase public demand \u2013 in effect trying to stimulate the economy through fiscal spending. Clearly the signs are there won\u2019t be any major spending of a traditional sort but there is strong talk that the government will use \u201coff-budget\u201d measures to pay for infrastructure. Such spending may not increase the deficit but it should increase public demand growth. The RBA would be glad to see it. Stevens has for a long time been warning that lowering rates doesn\u2019t have the power to boost the economy that it once did. Just two weeks ago he told an audience in New York that \u201cwhile people find global growth outcomes still a bit disappointing, we are reaching the limits of monetary policy in boosting it\u201d. He argued that \u201ccentral banks must of course do what they can\u201d but \u201csurely diminishing returns are setting in\u201d and he suspected \u201cthat more and more people realise this\u201d. But the question is whether or not the treasury realises this or whether he still wants to leave it up to lower interest rates to do the heavy lifting.",

      "bodyText": "Mercedes took another one-two in Russia \u2013 not something that the team, who claimed their last two constructor titles here in Sochi, will be in anyway disappointed with \u2013 but this was not quite the well-oiled machine that delivered those titles. Nico Rosberg\u2019s win was, as with his other three this season, delivered with aplomb but not under any pressure, while his team-mate Lewis Hamilton\u2019s second place, after a weekend again bedevilled by mechanical problems, put his team on the defensive against the conspiracy theorists. Rosberg\u2019s win from pole to flag was untroubled by close competition, largely because Hamilton had to start from 10th place after he suffered a failure of the MGU-H turbo hybrid unit in qualifying \u2013 the same component that had overheated in China in the previous race, forcing him to start from the back of the grid in Shanghai. He put in a gutsy recovery drive and got into second place but, having clawed the gap back to 7.5 seconds to Rosberg, he had to back off with a water pressure problem and settle for second. This poor luck, with Hamilton\u2019s struggles this season delivering second, third and seventh places before Sochi compared with Rosberg\u2019s flawless and problem-free runs to four wins, has brought the grassy knoll brigade scurrying from their caves, proudly sporting newly folded tinfoil hats. Indeed, the suggestion that Mercedes are somehow trying to steer the championship into Rosberg\u2019s hands has now been mentioned often enough that the team addressed it after the race. \u201cI\u2019m not going to respond to every lunatic that sends a message,\u201d said the team\u2019s executive director, Toto Wolff. \u201cSome of them are abusing the team and abusing members of the team and I would never allow that. The last thing we would do is sabotage Lewis Hamilton. He\u2019s a great friend to us. We feel awful because he\u2019s not been able to perform the best and we are letting him down.\u201d Adding grist to the mill for the Mercedes-also-faked-the-moon-landings gang was the switch for this season of a number of crew across from Hamilton\u2019s to Rosberg\u2019s garage and vice versa, including in each case the No1 mechanics. At the time the team claimed it was just to keep things fresh but with it has come the problems to a car that was almost bulletproof in testing. Hamilton was having none of it, however. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of my guys, the guys on my side of the garage are having a hard time at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cSince I joined this team I had a group of guys and for no particular reason it was swapped and those guys have come over and now we have had some bad experiences and I imagine they are feeling the pressure but it\u2019s nothing to do with them.\u201d Hamilton is nothing if not happy to repeat his assertion that his team win and lose together and has never pointed the finger at his crew, something that would not begin here. \u201cThey are doing a fantastic job,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is no reason we can\u2019t win its just that we have these bugs coming along.\u201dWolff said after the race that Rosberg had experienced a technical problem as well, which he described as \u201ca strange signal from the power unit\u201d. It did not stop the German putting in the fastest lap towards the end, though, and was another nebulous enough reason for itchy fingers to start typing on Twitter. This was becoming all too much for Wolff. \u201cI think it is difficult to take people out there seriously when they are lying in their beds with their laptops on their chests sending those abusive messages out,\u201d he said \u201cYou wonder what goes through their minds. Lewis has won two championships with this team. The reason why I am being vocal about it is because those guys are being hit by comments that are unfair and outright abusive without reason. We have made a few mistakes and let Lewis down but some of those guys could take it hard.\u201d That Mercedes, a team that have positively revelled in Hamilton\u2019s victories over the past two years and spend a fortune competing in Formula One, might actively sabotage one of their drivers is a nonsense barely worth a response. Yet that they have felt it necessary to react is perhaps indicative of the pressure they are feeling. Now trailing Rosberg by 43 points, the Briton and the championship badly need a clean, problem-free win to put the focus back on the reality of racing.",

Now trailing Rosberg by 43 points, the Briton and the championship badly need a clean, problem-free win to put the focus back on the reality of racing.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Romanian sex workers challenge UK immigration policy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A policy aimed at deporting \u201chigh-harm\u201d EU-national criminals and those not entitled to remain in Britain is to be challenged by Romanian sex workers who maintain they are self-employed. Although freedom of movement is guaranteed within the European Union, the right to stay \u2013 after the first three months \u2013 is dependent on new arrivals \u201cexercising their treaty rights\u201d, for example, by working or studying. Operation Nexus, a combined police and immigration initiative involving sharing intelligence, has been targeting foreign offenders and those suspected of breaking the law since 2012. Among those detained and served with deportation papers are an increasing number of women from eastern Europe who have been working on the streets and in premises across London and Manchester. Many do not have convictions. Prostitution is legal in the UK, although activities associated with it such as kerb-crawling, pimping and owning a brothel are crimes. Some of the women have been arrested by officers during raids intended to break up trafficking rings. The women, mainly Romanian, have received letters from Operation Nexus officers giving them about a month\u2019s notice that they are liable to be detained and put on a flight back to Bucharest. EU nationals\u2019 administrative removal on the grounds of not observing their treaty rights can be challenged by arguing that they are studying, working, seeking employment, self-employed or economically self-sufficient in the UK. If removed, EU nationals are banned from re-entering the UK for 12 months. Several women fighting deportation are now being supported by the English Collective of Prostitutes (ECP). \u201cThere was a raid which was supposed to be saving victims from trafficking,\u201d explained one young woman who wished to remain anonymous. \u201cThe police took paperwork and money. I asked for a receipt. They said I was being cheeky. They wanted to know if had been trafficked and asked the client if I was taking drugs. He said no. \u201cThey didn\u2019t arrest me but said I should be deported and asked me to go to the police station. I went along with a lawyer and showed a letter from a course proving that I was studying English.\u201d The threat to remove her was eventually dropped. Maria, not her real name, was stopped on the street and taken to a police station. \u201cI was held for 24 hours,\u201d the 25-year-old said. \u201cA week later I received a letter [saying I would be removed].\u201d Victoria, again a pseudonym, was arrested at her flat and questioned about running a brothel. \u201cI was never charged,\u201d the 21-year-old said, \u201cbut I was sent a letter. They have taken my passport and said that if my appeal is not successful I will be deported. \u201cHere you can earn money more easily than in Romania; you can have a better future. I can\u2019t find a normal job.\u201d Some of the women who were sent removal letters are now planning to challenge them on the grounds that they are exercising their treaty rights through being self-employed in the sex industry. Previous EU law cases have established that prostitution constitutes self-employment. Niki Adams, a spokeswoman for the ECP, said: \u201cThis deliberate policy of deportation and destitution targets immigrant women, who because of the criminalisation and stigma associated with sex work, will find it harder to defend themselves. \u201cAll the women are mothers who went into sex work because wages in other jobs were too low to feed and clothe their children or because they faced racism from employers.\u201d Emma Lough, a solicitor from the London-based Aire Centre, which specialises in European legal rights, said: \u201cOften people receive removal proceedings from the Home Office following information being built up by Operation Nexus police officers, which has been shown to have a disproportionate impact on certain groups and sex workers are one of them. \u201cEU law recognises sex work for the purposes of being a \u2018worker\u2019 but it\u2019s hard to provide evidence for it and therefore to show that you have exercisable rights. It\u2019s difficult to show employment records. \u201cThe procedure of administrative removal means removing those deemed not to be exercising treaty rights. We see a lot of 19/20-year-old girls who have lived in the UK most of their lives, got caught up in drugs and petty crime and are now facing deportation to a country where they may not speak the language. \u201cThe Home Office have to demonstrate that someone poses some risk to society in order to justify a deportation decision. However, we see deportation decisions based on very low levels of risk without adequate consideration of the likely harm.\u201d The Aire Centre is also preparing a separate challenge to the legality of Operation Nexus based on other cases, not related to sex work. Operation Nexus operates through embedding immigration officers in police stations. It targets both foreign offenders and those breaching immigration regulations. Thousands of people \u2013 including many with criminal records \u2013 have been removed from the UK under Operation Nexus since 2012 although the Home Office declines to confirm precise numbers. The operational and intelligence co-operation between immigration and police has been spread out to forces beyond London.",

      "bodyText": "In the end the Leicester City supporters decided to have a party anyway. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win the league\u201d seemed to be on a loop in the far corner of the stadium, where just over 3,000 travelling fans were bouncing up and down long after the players had left the pitch. The engraver has not yet been commissioned to start work on the Premier League trophy, but it looks like a matter of when and not if Leicester will be crowned champions and that moment may well arrive just before 10pm tomorrow. Trailing by eight points with three games remaining, Tottenham Hotspur now know they have no margin for error at Stamford Bridge and it is easy to imagine Chelsea, their bitter rivals, relishing the chance to twist the knife. Leicester can sit back and relax, knowing even if Spurs win at Chelsea the stage is set for a memorable evening at the King Power Stadium on Saturday, where a win over Everton would complete the fairytale. What a night that promises to be. The Manchester United supporters, showing a touch of class after the final whistle, clearly felt they had just watched the champions. As the Leicester players made their way along the front of the Sir Bobby Charlton stand and towards the tunnel, those United fans who had remained behind \u2013 and there were plenty of them \u2013 rose to applaud them in a gesture that was clearly appreciated, as Wes Morgan and his team-mates clapped in response. Moments later Jamie Vardy emerged from the tunnel, walked on to the pitch, shared a brief word with Fabio Capello \u2013 the now 29-year-old was playing for Stockbridge Park Steels when the Italian took England to the 2010 World Cup \u2013 and soaked up the atmosphere as he looked towards the sea of blue at the other end of the stadium. By now Leicester fans were going through their full repertoire of songs, including \u201cJamie Vardy\u2019s having a party\u201d. Vardy is back for the Everton match, after serving a two-match suspension following his sending-off against West Ham, and it says much for Leicester\u2019s spirit and resolve that they have collected four points without the services of the Premier League\u2019s second-highest goalscorer. In a game of musical chairs, Danny Drinkwater will now have to take Vardy\u2019s seat in the stand after his late dismissal here, which will almost certainly open the door to Andy King, perhaps fittingly given the Welshman is the longest-serving player at the club. In many ways a 1-1 draw at United was a strange scoreline for Leicester to try to digest and there was a moment at the end when Ranieri turned on his heel in the technical area and looked like a man who was not quite sure where to go and what to do. He had stood with his shoes within six inches of the pitch for the entire match, occasionally showing flashes of emotion, in particular in the frantic final minutes, when United were pressing for a winner. \u201cBe strong, come on!\u201d bellowed Ranieri, clenching his fists. Time and again this season his players have showed their resilience and never-say-die attitude, and this was another one of those occasions, especially after Leicester found themselves in the unfamiliar position of conceding first. United, for once, had started like a house on fire and, when Anthony Martial gave them the lead after only eight minutes, it was interesting to see how Leicester, with the eyes of the world watching them, would respond. Morgan, once of Dunkirk FC in the Midland Football Alliance and a former business student at South Notts college, provided the answer with a close-range header that exploited the weak link in United\u2019s defence. Marcos Rojo never looked equipped to deal with Morgan, who is built like a nightclub bouncer, and it showed every time the two came up against one another. As Morgan wheeled away to celebrate, Rojo had his face down in the turf and Leicester, in one perfectly executed set piece, had pulled the plug on United\u2019s electric opening. Alongside Robert Huth, Morgan has been outstanding this season and if there was a moment against United that summed up the value of that partnership to Leicester it was in the 71st minute. Stretching every sinew, Morgan managed to just about cut out a pass that threatened to release Marcus Rashford on goal. The United striker still pounced on the loose ball and thumped a right-footed shot that Huth, reading the danger, managed to get in position to block. At that point the Leicester fans were biting their nails in between breaking into chants of \u201cwe shall not be moved\u201d \u2013 a song that could easily be applied to Leicester\u2019s position at the top of the table.",

From your letters pages over past months, we know what the teachers\u2019 unions think, what retired inspectors think, what established poets and writers like Michael Rosen think, what education academics in universities think about these tests. There is a consensus that they are too difficult for such young children, do not help them to write well and are demoralising, demotivating and a waste&nbsp;of curriculum time. So, where is all this nonsense coming from? Who is devising and writing these tests? What is their background, their education history? And more importantly, do they have any experience in teaching or educational research? I would like to see some investigative journalism undertaken by the Guardian using freedom of information legislation to expose exactly who, which civil servants, are advising the hapless Nicky Morgan and writing these execrable \u201ctests\u201d. I suspect these advisers from the ivory towers of the Department for Education will prove to have little experience of state sector education as a teacher, as a parent or as a pupil. Who exactly is the DfE \u201cspokesperson\u201d defending the indefensible? I think we should be told. Ruth Lewis Middlesbrough \u2022 I never thought I would find myself defending a Conservative educational initiative, but the comments of Amanda Hulme offer a sad insight into primary education in England. Millions of children across Europe learn the basic elements of grammar and how to parse sentences (including the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs) in primary school, and no one sees this as beyond their ability, just as it is taken for granted that they will master their multiplication tables. Among other things, this knowledge makes it easier to learn foreign languages and write in one\u2019s own. Having lived in the UK for 10 years and seen our children go through the school system, my strong impression is that many schools have too little faith in what children can learn and do not challenge them enough, leading to rather understandable complaints of boredom. As to \u201cget[ting] by for 23 years without knowing what a transitive verb is\u201d, I imagine that lots of people have \u201cgotten by\u201d without knowing the basics of music theory, but this hardly means their lives wouldn\u2019t have been richer if they had. And one would expect a music teacher to provide these basics. Dr David Lines Kenilworth, Warwickshire \u2022 Your report on primary grammar tests and the letter from Philip Pullman and 83 others (Sats have troubled too many children, 30 April) should herald a commission into primary education. In the 1970s and 1980s many of our primary schools were the admiration of the world in combining effective learning of the 3Rs with many-faceted creativity and a careful nurture of personal and social development. (Yes, others did not reach these heights of achievement). But instead of helping all primary schools to achieve this high standard of all-round development, politicians of left and right since 1988 (Kenneth Baker\u2019s Education Reform Act) have regimented the 3Rs and largely neglected everything else. It has now reached an absurd level such as \u201cfronted adverbials\u201d in year 4 and \u201cmodal verbs\u201d in year 5. A commission should examine: (1) the demands of the national curriculum and testing regime: (2) the reported unhappiness of many children and teachers; (3) the workload of teachers and their remuneration; (4) the future of local authorities in education and provision of school places; (5) the government\u2019s intention to academise all schools; (6) Ofsted system of school inspection; and (7) proposals for a National Education Service led not by ministers but by a National Education Council of teachers, parents, academics, business and professional people, and politicians. This commission would raise public consciousness of how the education of our children is directed less by the professionalism of trained teachers and more by the obsessions of ministers. Emeritus Professor Michael Bassey&nbsp; Newark, Nottinghamshire \u2022 It is not only our most famous authors who would struggle with the latest assessments dreamt up by the government. As a lecturer with many years\u2019 experience of teaching linguistics, I have seen at first hand how difficult these concepts are, even for undergraduate and postgraduate students. To expect 10-year-olds to understand different kinds of determiners, modal and intransitive verbs and relative clauses is simply neither appropriate nor a good use of precious learning time. It is setting most of them up to fail, is incredibly stressful for teachers and children, and will stifle creativity. If this Gradgrind model of education had been imposed on Jane Austen she would probably never have written her wonderful novels at all. Jean Glasberg Cambridge \u2022 Amid all the consternation and furore surrounding the testing regime in schools, I find it astonishing that all we have heard from the children\u2019s commissioner\u2019s office is a deafening silence.

      "bodyText": "I have been disappointed by the Green party refusing to be drawn on the use of the second-preference vote in the London mayoral election and by its recent election broadcast suggesting that there is little distinction between the Tories and Labour. I was even more disappointed this weekend to receive in my inbox an email from Lib Dem HQ telling activists to spend the last few days of the campaign \u201ccapitalising\u201d on Labour party \u201ctroubles\u201d. Let\u2019s be clear: Caroline Pidgeon and I have spent the last four years on the London assembly working closely with both Labour and Green colleagues. Together we have mounted robust opposition to Boris\u2019s abysmal record of inaction on housing, the environment and transport. We have worked together because we have found there to be a great deal more that unites us than divides us. To suggest otherwise is ridiculous and unhelpful. The Tory party is divided and isolated \u2013 out of touch and with luck soon to be out of office. Its campaign has been a disgrace. Its only remaining hope is that Zac Goldsmith will be able to spread the delusion that he is somehow an environmentalist. In fact his Tory colleagues on the assembly have spent the last four years arguing that London should become the UK centre for fracking; and he is advocating that Britain leave the EU, whose laws have driven all the major improvements we have seen in recent decades on air pollution, waste management, and carbon emissions. My friend and colleague Caroline Pidgeon will get my first-preference vote for mayor on Thursday. She has a well-thought-out set of policies for London and her eight years of experience at City Hall has shone through during her confident hustings performances. But of course my second-preference vote will go to Sadiq Khan. It\u2019s a no-brainer. Stephen Knight AM Liberal Democrat London assembly member \u2022 We are all current or former legal practitioners. Sadiq Khan has, for over two decades, been a champion of civil liberties. As a human rights lawyer, Sadiq took on cases that tackled injustice and discrimination. Doing that type of legal work means sometimes acting for clients who sometimes had unsavoury and unpopular views. Sadiq has never chosen to hide this fact. He is standing to be mayor of London and we recognise that with that comes greater public scrutiny. But we are disappointed at attacks levelled against him simply because of his legal career and championing human rights before becoming a politician.

      "body": "<p>I have been disappointed by the Green party refusing to be drawn on the use of the second-preference vote in the London mayoral election and by its recent election broadcast suggesting that there is little distinction between the Tories and Labour. I was even more disappointed this weekend to receive in my inbox an email from Lib Dem HQ telling activists to spend the last few days of the campaign \u201ccapitalising\u201d on Labour party \u201ctroubles\u201d. Let\u2019s be clear: Caroline Pidgeon and I have spent the last four years on the London assembly working closely with both Labour and Green colleagues. Together we have mounted robust opposition to Boris\u2019s abysmal record of inaction on housing, the environment and transport. We have worked together because we have found there to be a great deal more that unites us than divides us. To suggest otherwise is ridiculous and unhelpful.</p> <p>The Tory party is divided and isolated \u2013 out of touch and with luck soon to be out of office. Its campaign has been a disgrace. Its only remaining hope is that Zac Goldsmith will be able to spread the delusion that he is somehow an environmentalist. In fact his Tory colleagues on the assembly have spent the last four years arguing that London should become the UK centre for fracking; and he is advocating that Britain leave the EU, whose laws have driven all the major improvements we have seen in recent decades on air pollution, waste management, and carbon emissions. My friend and colleague Caroline Pidgeon will get my first-preference vote for mayor on Thursday. She has a well-thought-out set of policies for London and her eight years of experience at City Hall has shone through during her confident hustings performances. But of course my second-preference vote will go to Sadiq Khan. It\u2019s a no-brainer.<br /><strong>Stephen Knight AM</strong><br /><em>Lib</em>eral<em> Dem</em>ocrat<em> London assembly member</em></p> <p>\u2022 We are all current or former legal practitioners. Sadiq Khan has, for over two decades, been a champion of civil liberties. As a human rights lawyer, Sadiq took on cases that tackled injustice and discrimination. Doing that type of legal work means sometimes acting for clients who sometimes had unsavoury and unpopular views. Sadiq has never chosen to hide this fact. He is standing to be mayor of London and we recognise that with that comes greater public scrutiny. But we are disappointed at attacks levelled against him simply because of his legal career and championing human rights before becoming a politician.</p> <p>Those suggesting that Sadiq somehow shares the views of such clients are simply misguided and demonstrate an ignorance of the way our legal system works. Lawyers act on instruction by their clients, not by adopting their views.

The theory holds that evolution is at work, as good business thrives by innovation and competition, while the weak fall away. Meanwhile, democratic governments provide social guarantees so that this natural selection does not inflict cruelty on the citizens who depend on the economy for their livelihoods. That is why the ruin of BHS is a story of political failure as well as a product of commercial mismanagement. The collapse of the famous high street chain, leaving 11,000 jobs in jeopardy and a staff pension fund with a \u00a3571m deficit, has been widely reported as a case study of corporate greed. There have been calls for Sir Philip Green, who owned the company for 15 years, to be stripped of his knighthood. Sir Philip, his wife and Dominic Chappell, who heads Retail Acquisitions \u2013 the consortium that later bought BHS \u2013 look set to be summoned by parliament\u2019s business and work and pensions committees, as part of twin inquiries into the affairs of what is now a hollowed-out shell of a company in administrators\u2019 hands. If these probes go ahead, they might shed some light on the mechanisms by which the value that there once was in BHS was apparently turned to cash and siphoned off. That is if Sir Philip and others deign to attend the committees. They might, like Mike Ashley \u2013 the founder of Sports Direct, who now offers himself as an unlikely saviour of the BHS workforce \u2013 defy a summons to appear. MPs want to speak to Mr Ashley about low pay and alleged worker exploitation. He dismisses them as \u201ca joke\u201d. That episode testifies to the weakness of political institutions as a check on business. Market fundamentalists used to argue that this is as it ought to be, that politicians should not be allowed to meddle in commerce other than to uphold the law \u2013 and that there should be as few laws as possible. \u201cNot just a light touch but a limited touch\u201d was the mantra at one time. But that doctrine\u2019s decline really began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and all the bailouts, government guarantees and taxpayer buy-ups which became necessary in its wake. It was clear then, when the protagonists were bankers not retailers, that the role of the state in the private sector goes well beyond deciding how much or little to regulate. A systemic, perhaps inescapable, transfer of risk to the public realm was laid bare, and the Pension Protection Fund\u2019s prospective rescue&nbsp;of the BHS fund illustrates this once again. Meanwhile, the rewards for failure head offshore. What is acceptable and what is within the letter of the law are not the same thing. That is not to say that the capitalist ethos is inherently corrupt. There will always be a section of the revolutionary left that sees private enterprise as a quasi-criminal requisitioning of public goods. Most moderate left opinion just wants business to be run with more than a patina of social conscience. Ed Miliband made \u201cresponsible capitalism\u201d the theme for his leadership of the Labour party. It didn\u2019t translate into an election-winning slogan, and maybe it was never going to. Yet his agenda has been vindicated. It is no longer radical to observe that the short-term sweating of assets for quick profits, over-gearing and underinvestment, avoidance of taxes, poverty wages and job insecurity are symptoms of a disease that limits the shrinks the nation\u2019s economic potential. It is, for example, increasingly common for shareholders to complain, as happened recently at BP, about remuneration packages for senior executives unconnected to commercial reason \u2013 or reality. Pay is just one example of a market that is not working as the theory says it should, neither maximising efficiency nor promoting best practice. British capitalism is riddled with failures of that kind. The social consequences, public anger among them, are impossible to ignore. That is not a reason to hate business. Market forces are something to be harnessed or resisted depending on what circumstance requires, not an evil to be despised or abolished. The challenge for politicians is striking a balance between what is permitted, what is encouraged, what is denounced and what is outlawed in markets. The case of BHS is just the latest to prove that the balance has not properly been struck. To leave it without redress will lead to more economic failures which, in time, will bring politics itself further into disrepute \u2013 a most dangerous trajectory.",

      "bodyText": "Last December\u2019s general election was supposed to give Spain \u2013 weary of austerity, fed up with scandals and tired of incumbents who seemed to have been around too long \u2013 a political new start. But the paradoxical result of the rise of two parties promising fresh approaches to the country\u2019s problems has been paralysis, not forward movement. After months of squabbling and manoeuvring, King Felipe last week gave up his efforts to persuade the politicians to agree on a coalition which could rule the country, and there will now be new elections in late June. The awkward arithmetic of the December vote meant that a coalition would only be possible if principles were sacrificed to practicality by one or more of the players. The trouble is that the compromises explored in the attempts to form a viable coalition diluted the very message which excited voters in December \u2013 that deals and fixes would become things of the past \u2013 yet the failure to agree confirmed the contrasting view that politicians were putting their own interests before those of the country. If there were an easy way out in the shape of the new elections then that could be a solution, but the polls suggest that although there will be some shifts in the share of votes, the next vote may well lead to another deadlock. It is obvious that neither the voters nor the parties, old and new, wanted this outcome. Voters for the two mainstream parties wanted&nbsp;the familiar political balance and alternation that has characterised Spain since&nbsp;the 1980s. Voters for the two upstart parties, Podemos and Ciudadanos, wanted different things. Podemos emphasised an end&nbsp;to austerity, popular participation, and&nbsp;an assault on neoliberalism. Just as Podemos represented an attempt to renew the left, Ciudadanos constituted an attempt at renewal on the right, with a particular stress on clean government. In 2006, the party launched a campaign in which its leader Albert Rivera appeared naked to emphasise the idea of a new, clean party being born. In the 2015 election both the new left and the new right did well, but the old left and the old right proved resilient, in each case gaining more votes than their rivals \u2013 many more, in the case of the ruling People\u2019s party. To quote a Podemos favourite, Antonio Gramsci, \u201cthe old is dying and the new cannot be born\u201d. The two left parties did not have enough seats to govern together; nor did the two parties of the right. The two old parties, the People\u2019s party and the Socialists, would have had the seats to govern, but refused to form a grand coalition. The Socialists could have joined with both the two new parties, but this threesome repeatedly failed to find enough common ground. The favourite Spanish word for the resulting muddle is circo, or circus. It is not as if Spain can afford to fiddle around for much longer in this way. The country urgently needs an agreement on Catalonia, where a separatist government has been pressing for an independence referendum. Only Podemos has been ready to consider the Catalan demand. Then there is austerity, opposition to which was the original trigger for Spain\u2019s new politics. It has not gone away, as recent Brussels warnings over Spain\u2019s growing deficit show. Somebody needs to be in charge if these and other pressing issues are to be tackled effectively, yet the prospects of that happening soon are not good.",

      "bodyText": "There are an estimated 26,000 child refugees in Europe as a result of recent international crises. Many are living in conditions of absolute desperation \u2013 hungry, cold, scared and, according to Europol, increasingly exposed to trafficking and sexual exploitation. We were therefore extremely disappointed that a proposal to accept 3,000 refugee children was defeated in the Commons. The proposal has been on the table since the middle of last year. During that time, it is estimated that at least 10,000 displaced children have gone missing after entering Europe. Our government\u2019s response to the plight of children, isolated and afraid in makeshift camps from Lesbos to Calais, should be focused entirely on their best interest. Increasing aid to the regions in conflict is well and good. But ignoring children already in Europe \u2013 or cheese-paring our support through lengthy bureaucratic processes \u2013 is simply unacceptable. Allowing child refugees to be left in inhuman and dangerous conditions is not only against the spirit and letter of universal and European human rights conventions, the convention on the rights of the child to which the UK is signatory, and the UK\u2019s Children Act. It risks undermining the UK\u2019s moral authority in the quest to confront radicalisation and build international security. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health urges the government to reconsider its decision, take a leadership role within Europe in addressing the larger crisis of unaccompanied child refugees and, for those refugee children already residing in the UK, facilitate the reunification of all children separated from family. Bhanu Williams (Global officer), Professor Neena Modi (President), Sebastian Taylor (Head of global operations) Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health \u2022 Liz Clegg is a fantastic example of the British people helping in Calais (Report, 29 April). Save the Children has trained 100 brilliant volunteers working in the Calais refugee camp in psychological first aid, sharing our experience of helping traumatised victims of war. Save the Children funds grassroots charities in Calais, including Jungle Books Library and Baloo\u2019s Youth Centre, which works with hundreds of vulnerable children in the camp, and supports Help Refugees Citizens UK in its excellent work. Our focus in Calais is the lone children who are forced to gamble \u2013 and sometimes lose \u2013 their lives, trying to reach their family. Improving conditions in the camp is crucial, but we need more than a plaster on the catastrophic wound in Europe\u2019s refugee response. The camp has become a no man\u2019s land between the fifth and sixth richest nations, and requires a political solution. That\u2019s why we\u2019re asking the government to match its tremendous leadership of aid for the long-running Syria crisis with help for just 3,000 refugee children already in Europe. These children have a choice between the traffickers or the train tracks.

One was a knighted establishment figure who sold a high street chain store after taking out millions of pounds in dividends, leaving a massive pensions hole in a firm that has now collapsed, putting 11,000 jobs at risk. The other is an elected member of parliament. Only one of these Greens has been spied on by the police. Is this what is meant by a democratic deficit? Dr Robert Keats Shorwell, Isle of Wight \u2022 If the junior doctors\u2019 strike is today\u2019s miners\u2019 strike (Report, 26 April) then lessons can be learned from the past. The miners lost thanks to lack of support from the trade unions; this must not be allowed to happen again. The unions must now fully get behind the junior doctors and threaten industrial action on a mass scale. The Tories view the NHS and its staff as commodities to be sold off. If the junior doctors lose, we\u2019ll be&nbsp;one step further to losing our NHS for good. Bev Trounce Hove \u2022 I saw nine tautologies in your article (Has M&amp;S gone too far with its pre-cut avocado?, G2, 27 April). Every time I read \u201cpre-peeled\u201d or \u201cpre-diced\u201d I shuddered, and by the sixth paragraph a nervous tic had developed. A \u201cpre-peeled banana\u201d is a peeled banana. A \u201cpre-sliced avocado\u201d is a sliced avocado. \u201cPrepared sandwich\u201d would be bad enough; it\u2019s obviously been prepared, as it exists. To go one stage further and call it a \u201cpre-prepared sandwich\u201d is just pre-preposterous.

One was a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/28/philip-green-knighthood-integrity-bhs-john-collins-forfeiture-committee\" title=\"\">knighted establishment figure who sold a high street chain store</a> after taking out millions of pounds in dividends, leaving a massive pensions hole in a firm that has now collapsed, putting 11,000 jobs at risk.

      "bodyText": "Sanders is taking questions from the press. \u201cThe ideas we are fighting for are the future of the Democratic party and indeed the future of this country,\u201d Bernie Sanders tells reporters at the National Press Club in Washington DC. He mentions climate change, \u201cgrotesque\u201d wealth inequality, reforming taxes for corporations and the richest Americans, education and healthcare \u2013 the many progressive issues of his campaign. Then he talks about delegate math. A Democratic candidate needs 2,083 \u201cIt is virtually impossible for Secretary Clinton to reach the majority of delegates by June 14, that is the last day a primary will be held,\u201d he says, \u201cwith pledged delegates alone. She will need superdelegates to take her over the top at the convention in Philadelphia.\u201d \u201cIn other words the convention will be a contested contest.\u201d \u201cThere are 10 states remaining where we\u2019re going to be vigorously competing,\u201d he adds, plus several territories. He says he needs 65% of the remaining delegates to win. We intend to fight for every vote in front of us and every vote remaining.\u201d He then talks about superdelegates: \u201cObviously we are taking on virtually the entire Democratic establishment.\u201d Of the 719 superdelegates, he says, many committed themselves to Clinton before the campaign began a year ago. \u201cWhile we have won 45% of the pledged delegates in real campaigns where the people have spoken,\u201d he says, \u201cwe have won only 7% of the superdelegates.\u201d \u201cThose superdelegates where states where either candidate has won a landslide victories, those superdelegates ought to seriously reflect on whether they ought to cast their superdelegate vote in align[ment] with the wishes of the people of those states.\u201d Secondly, he says, he and Clinton disagree on many things: trade, breaking up banks, the rate of minimum wage hikes, a carbon tax, fracking, etc. \u201cBut where Secretary Clinton and I strongly agree, and where every delegate to the Democratic convention strongly agrees, is that it would be a disaster to this country if Donald Trump or some other rightwing Republican were to become president of the United States.\u201d He spins this call to unity into an argument that he \u201cstands the better chance of defeating Donald Trump and other Republican candidates\u201d. Bernie Sanders is due to speak in Washington DC in the next few minutes, a year on from his campaign announcement. My colleague Dan Roberts is reporting from the scene. \u201cIf we win in Indiana, it\u2019s all over,\u201d Trump promises. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get there anyway. And then we can focus on Crooked Hillary, please, let\u2019s focus on Hillary.\u201d He goes on for a bit about the delegate system \u2013 he needs 1,237 delegates to clinch the Republican nomination. He says he\u2019ll have \u201cfive, six million more votes\u201d than Ted Cruz or John Kasich, and \u201clike five or six hundred delegates more\u201d. \u201cBecause there was 17 people you couldn\u2019t get [to 1,237 because] there was all those early states,\u201d Trump says. But none of it matters: \u201cWe don\u2019t play the second ballot game, we\u2019re only playing to win.\u201d Then he ridicules Cruz a little more. \u201cThe first time in the history of politics that a man who cannot win because he has no path,\u201d Trump says, \u201cand he\u2019s choosing a vice president.\u201d \u201cHe has no path to victory!\u201d He also says that he wants to get to general election business. \u201cWe want to raise money for the party,\u201d he says, alluding to those looming Senate and House races that have moderate Republicans terrified of losing their seat. He\u2019d rather do that \u201cinstead of wasting our time\u201d. You don\u2019t have to be a good student,\u201d Trump tells the crowd. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to be smart. It doesn\u2019t help us.\u201d Then he talks about how much he\u2019s won, eg \u201cI won with women! I won big!\u201d Stat guru Harry Enten, of FiveThirtyEight, notes that Trump is not really winning in the polls outside of the Republican primary. But Trump is enjoying talking, not reading Harry\u2019s tweets. He says he\u2019s really glad to have the endorsement of businessman Carl Icahn and Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions. \u201cEven I was surprised!\u201d \u201cI watched Lindsey Graham on television this morning,\u201d Trump continues, before he loses his train of thought. He says he\u2019s knocked 17 rivals out of the race, except for two. \u201cThey\u2019re like hanging by their fingertips.\u201d Then he mocks Ted Cruz for announcing that former HP CEO Carly Fiorina would be his running-mate. \u201cLet me choose Carly, maybe that will turn it around,\u201d Trump says. It\u2019s much more impressive, according to the businessman, to have an endorsement from Bobby Knight, the college basketball coach as legendary for his violent outbursts (and alleged assaults on players) as his winning teams. Then he\u2019s back onto Cruz and the third candidate in the race, John Kasich. \u201cI refuse to call them the leftovers, it\u2019s not respectful,\u201d Trump says, not refusing at all. He flails his arms and turns his ovoice into a whine: \u201cThe two guys that are hanging by their fingernails. \u2018Don\u2019t let me fall! Don\u2019t let me fall!\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd then,\u201d he growls into the mic, \u201cwe go after \u2018Crooked Hillary,\u2019 folks!\u201d Donald Trump is speaking in Terre Haute, Indiana, and the rally is off to its typical rambling start. He talks about how he gets \u201cgreat ratings\u201d for the cable shows, even though he\u2019s only been on one such show in several weeks. He says the press are \u201cextremely dishonest people\u201d. He talks about how he went to California on Friday and spoke for thousands of people. He talks about protests against him, but he doesn\u2019t call them protests: \u201cthese thugs were jumping onto these cars.\u201d \u201cThese guys should be put in jail for five years they\u2019ll never do it again I promise.\u201d He loves the police, by the way, has he mentioned that? Beautiful police. He says business executives and foreign leaders \u201care like grand chessmasters\u201d while in the US \u201cwe\u2019re like checker players\u201d. He segues from our \u201cstupid\u201d leaders\u2019 concern about global warming to talk about a kind of global warming that he does fear, \u201cit\u2019s made of the nuclear variety, that\u2019s the one we have to be careful of.\u201d The audience doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s sure how to react to this, since it\u2019s not clear what nuclear global warming is. He doesn\u2019t mention it now, but Trump has also previously suggested it would be a good idea to let South Korea, Japan and other nations develop their own nuclear weapons, even though he fears \u201cthe nuclear\u201d more than anything else. \u201cI\u2019m worried about one thing: America first, we\u2019re going to put America first.\u201d America First was a non-interventionist movement led, in part, by famous aviator Charles Lindbergh in the years before World War II. Lindberg was such an admirer of Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazi regime in Berlin that before the war broke out he intended to move there. Donald Trump does not appear to know anything about Charles Lindbergh or the historical antecedents of the phrase \u201cAmerica first\u201d. He also spoke a bit about football. Donald Trump\u2019s son Eric vowed that he and his father will get the last laugh, after Barack Obama cracked a string of jokes at the Republican frontrunner\u2019s expense on Saturday night. Per the Hill: \u201cWe\u2019ll take some shots back next year. He who laughs last laughs longest, right?\u201d Trump said to The Hill in the reception area before the annual dinner event. \u201cI\u2019d be shocked if [Obama] didn\u2019t [take shots at Donald],\u201d Eric Trump\u2019s wife, Lara Yunaska, said. Eric Trump, the executive vice president of development and acquisitions at The Trump Organization, seemed excited for his first visit to the soiree. \u201cI build hotels,\u201d said Trump. \u201cWe don\u2019t do politics. This is uncharted territory to me.\u201d The artist of a nude painting of Donald Trump says she was punched by a Trump supporter in Los Angeles and filed a police report. She has previously said that she was threatened with legal action over the painting, which is not anatomically charitable to the Republican frontrunner. The Los Angeles Police Department did not immediately confirm to the Guardian whether a police report was filed, and the artist did not answer a phone number listed to her name. From Illma Gore\u2019s Instagram post. Today I was punched in the face by a man who got out of his car and yelled, \u201cTrump 2016!\u201d in Los Angeles, just days after I returned home from London just down the road from my house. Though I encourage passion, opinion and emotion, especially though art, I think violence is disgusting. To live in a place where Facebook has given my address to an anonymous third party makes me feel like I am homeless again. This type of violence makes creatives feel like we live in a world where our individual creative input isn\u2019t safe. I am sad that this is the state of our America right now. I am sad that Trump, and many of his supporters, don\u2019t find words enough to express their opinions - they need walls, waterboarding and punches.@realdonaldtrump Please stop glamorizing and perpetuating violence. Make America Decent Again!#makeamericadecentagain No, they have not been caught, and the men drove off laughing. A detailed police report has been filed. The Republican frontrunner did not spend his morning facing a carousel of journalists, but he did use campaign time to watch the shows anyway. Far away, from the East Wing of the White House, an update on the first family\u2019s plans for when they\u2019re well away from politics. Senator Lindsey Graham, a former presidential candidate and one of the most vocal anti-Trump Republicans, is next on the CBS program. He minces no words: \u201cLucifer is the only person Trump could beat in a general election.\u201d Graham now supports Ted Cruz, though he once compared the choice between Trump and Cruz to \u201cbeing shot or poisoned\u201d. \u201cTrumpism will get creamed in the ballot box,\u201d Graham says. \u201cThere\u2019s a civil war going on in the Republican party, I hope and pray that Ted Cruz, who\u2019s a reliable conservative, can carry the banner.\u201d Graham defines Trumpism as a \u201ccult of a strongman that absolutely is nowhere near conservatism\u201d. The senator describes Trump\u2019s plan to deport 11 million undocumented people as \u201cunworkable and hateful\u201d and his foreign policy as \u201cthe siren song of isolationism\u201d. Graham sits on the Senate\u2019s committee of foreign relations and says that Trump\u2019s foreign policy ideas ignore past mistakes by the US. He says Japan and South Korea are not \u201cfreeriders\u201d but \u201cvaluable allies\u201d, that \u201cglobalization is here to stay\u201d, and that the US needs Muslim Americans and partners abroad to fight terrorism. \u201cOur failure was not to follow through\u201d in Libya and Iraq, Graham argues, blaming the president for withdrawing forces from the latter. He ends with a desperate plea to his colleagues in Republican politics: reject Trump, be your own person, get as far away as possible or lose your seat in Congress. Bernie Sanders is appearing on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, with host John Dickerson. Dickerson asks whether Sanders has any realistic chance left to win the nomination \u201cIt\u2019s difficult, it\u2019s not impossible,\u201d Sanders insists. He says his campaign needs 65% of the remaining delegates. \u201cCalifornia happens to be perhaps the most progressive state in this country, they have the most delegates.\u201d California votes on 7 June. Sanders repeats a familiar argument that he\u2019s best placed to defeat Donald Trump. If the Democrats want to win in November, he says, hinting toward superdelegats, \u201cif they want the campaign that has the energy, the excitement, the young people,\u201d then they should be turning to team Sanders. He says that superdelegates, aka party officials who are free to vote as they please in the party\u2019s convention, are not inherently unfair. \u201cWhat\u2019s unfair is even before I get into the campaign Hillray Clinton has some four, five hundred superdelegates on her side.\u201d Then he starts talking about bigger ambitions \u2013 an echo of last week, when he said his campaign is \u201cthe future of the Democratic party\u201d, and a departure from his many vows to win the nomination. Sanders maintains that he is the candidate representing working people, but argues that his underdog campaign is doing a net good for Democrats by continuing its fight with Hillary Clinton. \u201cI believe that it is good for American democracy when we have a vigorous debate on the issues, and I believe that it is good for the Democratic party when we have a vigorous debate on the issues,\u201d he says. He assures Dickerson that his supporters will come into the eventual fold: \u201cof course the party needs to be unified and it will be unified after the convention in July.\u201d But he also asserts that \u201clooking at the status quo,\u201d the American people are dissatisfied. \u201cThey\u2019re looking at the nation, and they\u2019re saying as a nation we can do much better, and we can have real change.\u201d Finally Todd gets round to asking Cruz a perennially awkward question: after all this talk bashing Donald Trump, would you support him if he\u2019s the nominee? Cruz makes a familiar dodge: \u201cI believe if the Republican Party nominates Donald Trump we will lose to Hillary, because when we offer Democrat-lite.\u201d Todd: All right. All right. All right. Can you support him? He tries hard to just get a yes or no out of Cruz. He points out it\u2019s about votes and delegates, not \u201cthe media\u201d, and that it doesn\u2019t matter whether Cruz can beat Hillary Clinton if he can\u2019t beat Trump. \u201cRepublican voters are the ones rejecting you,\u201d Todd says. \u201cThis is not a media conspiracy, senator. The senator suggests maybe it is a conspiracy. \u201cWith all due respect, the media has given $2bn of free advertising to Donald. Well, let me ask you a question, for example. How much money did the networks make on every one of the Republican debates?\u201d Todd has no idea, because he doesn\u2019t run the business side of NBC, which didn\u2019t air a Republican debate, much less boss of the other networks that aired debates. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you answer that question \u2013 black \u2013 straightforward, black and white?\u201d Cruz doesn\u2019t give up: \u201cyour network\u2019s executives are partisan Democrats,\u201d he says, without any evidence to support the generalization. \u201cThe simple reality is the media, almost entirely, are liberal, partisan, Democrats. That is the reality of it. The media created this Trump phenomenon, and then \u2013 and then they don\u2019t hold him accountable. Now, I\u2019m sure the media plan to do so if he\u2019s the nominee in the general election. \u201cSuddenly you\u2019re gonna hear every day about Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns. When was the last time you talked about his tax returns? You-- you know, we ought to have a debate. There are real differences. Donald won\u2019t debate and the media won\u2019t hold him accountable. I think the people of Indiana deserve a debate\u2026\u201d The verbal contortions are extraordinary. He jumps from one diversionary talking point \u2013 the media, debates, etc \u2013 to another. \u201cListen, this is my kids\u2019 future, Chuck. It\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not simply a game,\u201d he says. Todd: \u201cNobody\u2019s saying it\u2019s a game.\u201d Cruz says that \u201cif we lose this we lose our country.\u201d Even though Todd points out that Republican voters are rejecting him for Donald Trump and even John Kasich, he refuses to conceive of a United States that does not want Ted Cruz. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to give up on America.\u201d Todd: \u201cSo let the record show, you have not taken a position on whether Trump-- whether you can support Trump if he\u2019s the nominee. Fair enough?\u201d He asked him nine times. Cruz did not answer. Then Todd asks Cruz about comments by the former Republican Speaker of the House, John Boehner, who this week called Cruz \u201cLucifer in the flesh\u201d and the most \u201cmiserable son of a bitch\u201d he ever worked with. Cruz claims he doesn\u2019t know John Boehner, even though Boehner led the Republican party in Congress for years while Cruz served in the Senate, and, as third in line to the presidency, was an extremely important person for anyone in Washington DC to know. \u201cNumber one, I don\u2019t know John Boehner. The two of us haven\u2019t said 50 words to each other in our entire lives.\u201d What? Cruz engineered a government shutdown that Boehner helped lead\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s actually a good illustration,\u201d Cruz claims. He says he asked Senator Mike Lee and Beohner to join him, and \u2013 according to Cruz \u2013 Boehner said, \u201cNo interest. No value. I\u2019m not willing to talk to you.\u201d \u201cSo I don\u2019t know him at all. But what was interesting about Boehner\u2019s comments is he praised Hillary Clinton. He thinks she\u2019s terrific.\u201d Boehner and Clinton and Trump \u201care the Washington cartel. It is the corruption of Washington,\u201d Cruz says. He keeps developing this conspiratorial theory. \u201cDonald and Hillary are the ultimate Washington insiders. They have been enmeshed in the corruption. If you like John Boehner, if you want a presidential candidate like John Boehner, then Donald Trump is your candidate.\u201d He thinks Boehner \u201cwas auditioning\u201d to be Trump\u2019s vice-president \u2013 an unlikely move for a man who appeared in a comedic skit with Barack Obama last night. Todd presses Cruz on the point, noting that taxes on the wealthiest have gone up, and so have jobs. \u201cHow do you explain that?\u201d Cruz says he\u2019s wrong, even though the US has consistently surpassed expectations regarding unemployment in recent years. \u201cJob creation has not gone up, Chuck. We have the lowest percentage of Americans working of any year since 1977. The Obama-Clinton economy is a disaster\u2026\u201d Todd checks him: \u201cwe\u2019re in a six-year expansion right now.\u201d Well, it\u2019s pretty slow, Cruz tries. \u201cMillions of Americans are hurting. Income inequality has increased dramatically. Now, you know who is doing well? The rich. The Obama-Clinton economy has been very good for the Donald Trumps and Hillary Clintons of the world.\u201d Then Cruz, who himself is a millionaire and married to an executive at Goldman Sachs, tries on a populist costume. \u201cThe top 1% today earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.\u201d \u201cIf you go to our rallies, if you see who\u2019s comin\u2019 out, it\u2019s the single mom. It\u2019s the steel worker. It\u2019s the truck driver. It\u2019s the student. It\u2019s Hispanics. It\u2019s the people who are struggling to climb the economic ladder, who Washington ignores. That\u2019s who we need to be fighting for. I recognize that Wall Street and the lobbyists in K Street are doin\u2019 great under big government. But the rest of America is being ignored by Washington.\u201d Todd changes subject. He notes that Cruz\u2019s new running-mate, Carly Fiorina, was not so long ago saying \u201cTed Cruz is like any other politician\u201d who \u201csays whatever he needs to say to get elected, and then he\u2019s gonna do as he pleases.\u201d Cruz says it was all in good spirit back when Fiorina was his adversary in the Republican primary. She\u2019s endorsed him for a full seven weeks \u2013 might as well be years. Then he touts her business experience. She had a controversial and short tenure at the head of Hewlett Packard, but Cruz doesn\u2019t mention that. \u201cWith Carly it\u2019s the complete package. I was looking for someone who could be a partner. You know, I\u2019ve never understood people who just want a ceremonial vice president.\u201d Todd tries something a little more direct. He asks Cruz whether he\u2019s brought on Fiorina as a means of winning over women who object to Trump\u2019s objectifying and derogatory language about women. Cruz takes the bait. He points out that Trump is endorsed by former boxer Mike Tyson, whom Cruz describes as \u201ca convicted rapist who served three years in prison here in Indiana for rape\u201d. \u201cYou know what, Chuck? I don\u2019t think rapists are tough guys. I think they\u2019re weak, I think they\u2019re bullies, I think they\u2019re cowards. And it says something if Donald Trump thinks that a convicted rapist a tough guy. \u201cHe\u2019s proud of Mike Tyson\u2019s support, I\u2019m proud of Carly Fiorina and, and Mike Pence\u2019s support. And that is as clear a contrast for the people of Indiana and the people of this country as you could ask for.\u201d Todd follows up, asking what Cruz make\u2019s of Trump\u2019s comment that Hillary Clinton is playing \u201cthe woman card\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s typical Donald Trump,\u201d Cruz says. \u201cThe only thing he knows how to do in any given circumstance is he yells, he screams, he curses, or he insults. So there he\u2019s insulting Hillary. Listen, Hillary is a very smart, committed liberal. Her policies are profoundly wrong. The he says Trump secretly supports her policies: \u201cDonald and Hillary, they\u2019re flipsides of the same coin. They\u2019ve both gotten rich exploiting Washington, exploiting government power.\u201d Ted Cruz is now on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, where host Chuck Todd asks him about his somewhat dubious ability to unify Republicans. Cruz says that that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s doing, saying that even though Donald Trump won five large states in the north-east last week, he himself won five (much smaller) states in the weeks before, out west. Then he touts his new runningmate, Carly Fiorina, and an endorsement of Indiana\u2019s governor, Mike Pence, \u201ca strong, principled conservative\u201d. \u201cThat is really an illustration of how the party is coming together. And I think the people of Indiana, the entire country is looking to Indiana. And I think the country is really depending on Indiana,\u201d he says. So how important is Indiana, Todd asks. \u201cIndiana is an important state,\u201d Cruz replies. \u201cWe are competing hard. We\u2019re barnstorming the state. We\u2019re on a bus tour, Heidi and I and the girls and Carly.\u201d Todd: So if Indiana rejects you, they\u2019re rejecting that argument, are they not? Cruz says he doesn\u2019t think so. He thinks his support \u201cis surging\u201d. He stumps a little about jobs and wages, and adds: \u201cDonald\u2019s only economic agenda is imposing massive taxes on the American people with a 40% tax hike of a giant tariff. That would send us into a recession. It would drive jobs overseas. It would kill small businesses.\u201d Then he compares himself to Ronald Reagan and JFK both, saying not entirely correctly that they cut taxes and lifted regulations on small business. Wallace asks Trump about Barack Obama\u2019s mockery of him at the White House Correspondents Dinner. The president joked at Trump\u2019s expense at length, including a quip that Trump would be great at shutting down Guant\u00e1namo Bay. \u201cTrump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground.\u201d Trump didn\u2019t mind Obama\u2019s jokes at all. \u201cI think it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s fine.\u201d \u201cI guess I\u2019m good at something because I\u2019ve made more than $10bn and I started with a $1m loan.\u201d Finally Wallace asks Trump about Indiana, the next state to vote. Governor Mike Pence gave a lukewarm endorsement to Ted Cruz this week, and Cruz has tried to use boxer Mike Tyson\u2019s support for Trump against him. Trump doesn\u2019t really care. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Mike in years,\u201d he says. Cruz is \u201cthe greatest liar that ever lived except he gets caught all the time.\u201d Wallace turns to foreign policy \u2013 Trump gave a speech this week billed as a detailed policy plan. It was not entirely coherent. The Fox News host asks Trump about his philosophy of \u201cAmerica first\u201d, a more isolationist stance toward the world that would concentrate on domestic spending and avoid intervention abroad. He asks Trump whether he would prefer to keep autocratic strongmen, like Egypt\u2019s ex-president Hosni Mubarak and Libya\u2019s Muammar Gaddafi, to the troubled revolutions that deposed those men. Trump seems to conflate Mubarak with Gaddafi, and doesn\u2019t mention Egypt, which is specifically what Wallace asked about. \u201cYou have a mess. You have a big fat mess,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you knock out Iraq you\u2019re going to ruin the balance.\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done in the Middle East, we\u2019ve spent $4 trillion and we\u2019re far worse than when the first gunshot was fired.\u201d He gets back to domestic problems. \u201cWe have to rebuild our country. Our country is becoming third world,\u201d he says, comparing China\u2019s trains that travel \u201c300mph\u201d to American railroads. \u201cWe have the Long Island Railroad, and it can hardly \u2013 it can hardly move.\u201d Wallace gets him back to foreign policy, but Trump quickly goes on a tangent: \u201cIsis now has Libyan oil, you know it\u2019s among the finest oil in the world \u2026 And if we would\u2019ve left Gaddafi, we wouldn\u2019t have had that.\u201d Then he boasts about his lack of notable foreign policy advisors. \u201cI don\u2019t want the people that\u2019ve been involved for 15 years because those are the people what they\u2019ve absolutely done to this country, and our country.\u201d Wallace: So is it far to say that Hillary Clinton will be the hawk in this race and you\u2019ll be the dove? \u201cNo I\u2019ll tell you what I will be much tougher than her, I will have much more respect,\u201d Trump insists, ignoring the point about intervention versus reputation. He says he\u2019s glad to hear that foreign leaders are a little alarmed about his success. \u201cLet them be a little concerned.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re like the policemen to the world, what\u2019s going on is crazy.\u201d Donald Trump is ending a long hiatus from the Sunday shows to appear on Fox News Sunday, with host Chris Wallace. It\u2019s been almost a month since Trump appeared on any of the shows, which were long one of his favorite weekend activities. Wallace asks about sometimes violent protests at Trump rallies, including in California on Friday. \u201cIt was like a love fest for an hour and a half,\u201d Trump says of the California protests. \u201cI didn\u2019t even see the riots, you know these are wise guys that stomp on policemen\u2019s cars.\u201d Trump was forced from his motorcade by protesters at one point on Friday. \u201cThese were professional agitators,\u201d he continues, alluding to protesters that night. \u201cThese people have to be dealt with very strongly because you can\u2019t allow that to happen to a police car.\u201d \u201cBut this was an amazing evening,\u201d he insists. \u201cA record-setting crowd, and nobody even saw it.\u201d Wallace points out the general election is \u201ca different deal\u201d \u2013 that Trump is hugely disliked by Hispanic Americans and women voters beyond the Republican primary. \u201cThose numbers are going way up once I start going. I have two more people to get rid of,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce I start on Hillary you\u2019ll see the numbers change.\u201d He says his record of success in the Republican primary is a sign of how he\u2019ll do in the future. \u201cOne by one I won. Watch what happens with Hillary and watch what happens with my numbers.\u201d He says he\u2019s been \u201chit with 55,000 negative ads\u201d and hasn\u2019t been affected. What about Hillary Clinton, Wallace asks \u2013 a Fox News host defending her \u2013 she was a senator, she was secretary of state, \u201cto say if she were a man she would get 5%, isn\u2019t that kind of dismissive?\u201d \u201cThe fact is the only card she has is the woman\u2019s card,\u201d Trump says. \u201cEven women don\u2019t like her.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll play it well at all. And it\u2019s true. If she were not a woman she wouldn\u2019t even be in this race.\u201d Bernie Sanders has announced yet another extraordinary month of fundraising, raising $25.8m in April. The senator has routinely broke fundraising records with small donations, which he often touts on the campaign trail as a sign of his \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d. From the campaign: Since the Sanders campaign was launched one year ago, his supporters have revolutionized campaign fundraising and demonstrated that he can wage a competitive campaign for president without relying on Wall Street and other special interests. More than 7.4 million contributions have poured in from more than 2.4 million donors totaling $210 million. A key to Sanders\u2019 fundraising success has been that his grassroots supporters consistently have contributed more to his campaign than Hillary Clinton\u2019s big-dollar donors. Sanders\u2019 April donations far exceeded Hillary for America\u2019s $21 million in March. \u201cWhat our campaign is doing is bringing millions of Americans into the political process,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager. \u201cSanders is the candidate with the most energy and excitement. He is the candidate with the best chance of winning in November. He is the candidate who is in the best position to bring a new generation of voters into the democratic process and restore the faith of working-class voters that we can have a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.\u201d Sanders\u2019 average contribution was a little less than $26, the campaign said, boasting that teachers, students, engineers and young people make up the largest blocs of donors. It\u2019s an implicit rebuke of Clinton, who has received a large number of contributions from people who work in finance, law or are retired. Republican Ted Cruz is next up on the CNN program. CcHost Jake Tapper immediately notes comments by former Speaker of the House John Boehner \u2013 Republicans\u2019 long-time leader in Congress. Boehner said Cruz was \u201cLucifer in the flesh\u201d. Cruz immediately notes how he\u2019s gotten an endorsement from Indiana\u2019s governor, Mike Pence, and his new running-mate Carly Fiorina. He waxes grateful. Tapper turns it on him: doesn\u2019t picking Fiorina this early, months before the convention and hundreds of delegates away from the nomination, smack of desperation? Cruz says that\u2019s exactly what Trump wants you to think. \u201cHe either yells, screams, curses or insults, so it\u2019s no surprise he went with insult.\u201d \u201cThis is an unusual election but I think it\u2019s important to give the voters a clear contrast, a clear choice, between Carly and me on the one hand and Donald and Hillary\u201d on the other, he says. \u201cThey\u2019re flipsides of the same coin. They agree with each other on issue after issue after issue,\u201d Cruz goes on. \u201cThey\u2019re both Washington insiders.\u201d \u201cTrump has made billions buying politicians like Hillary Clinton,\u201d he says, lumping in Boehner for good measure. \u201cThey\u2019re all part of the same corrupt Washington system. Where the rich get richer.\u201d Cruz\u2019s new populist argument is a tricky one to make: he is a millionaire lawyer married to a Goldman Sachs financier and running for president alongside a millionaire former CEO. Tapper then asks Cruz about his support for a North Carolina law that requires transgender people use the bathroom of the gender they were assigned at birth. \u201cThe law doesn\u2019t specify transgender it\u2019s whatever you feel like at the given moment,\u201d Cruz says, arguing that although transgender people might not threaten children, the anti-discrimination rules that protect them could somehow leave children vulnerable to predators. Hillary Clinton is the first candidate to speak this morning, on CNN\u2019s State of the Union with host Jake Tapper. It\u2019s a pre-taped interview, the only one Clinton has given since her victory in four of five states that voted last Tuesday. Do you consider yourself the presumptive nominee, she\u2019s asked. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, adding that she\u2019s \u201con the path\u201d and doesn\u2019t want to take anything for granted. Tapper then asks her about Bernie Sanders\u2019 turn toward changing the agenda of the democratic party, rather than winning the nomination outright. \u201cThere comes a time where you have to look at the reality,\u201d Clinton replies. \u201cI certainly look forward to working with Senator Sanders,\u201d she says, promising that \u201cit will be a progressive platform.\u201d \u201cI really welcome his ideas and his supporters\u2019 passion and commitment, because the most important thing for us is for us to win in November,\u201d she adds. The \u201cprimary objective\u201d, she says, is \u201cto make sure that Donald Trump is not president. Clinton commiserates with Sanders and his supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d she says. \u201cYou throw yourself into these campaigns body and soul, you work 24/7.\u201d Then she essentially thanks Sanders for his contributions: bringing people into the party, and being \u201ca passionate advocate for the issues he feels passionately about\u201d. \u201cWe have far more in common,\u201d she says, \u201cthan Donald Trump.\u201d Trump\u2019s policy ideas are \u201cdisturbing\u201d, she says, noting his proposals to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the US and to create a religious registry. \u201cI know that the stakes are high, that we face some real challenges and dangers in the world,\u201d she says, but \u201cI don\u2019t think pretending you have some kind of secret plan is a smart way of leading.\u201d Asked about Trump\u2019s more isolationist tendencies, Clinton assures Tapper: \u201cI\u2019m always someone who uses military force as a last resort.\u201d Asked about some of Trump\u2019s remarks \u2013 about a \u201cwoman card\u201d and \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d \u2013 she says she doesn\u2019t respond to attacks. \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of silly,\u201d she adds, noting that she\u2019s been twice elected to the Senate, has two million more votes overall than Trump, and won Ohio and Pennsylvania by higher margins than he won in the Republican primary. \u201cI had a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and the way they speak,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to deal with their temper tantrums or their bullying.\u201d \u201cI could [sic] really care less.\u201d In a hint at some of her anti-Trump tactics to come, she notes that Trump\u2019s proposals are almost always extremely vague. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing secret about what I want to d,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve laid it all out there. And he can\u2019t. Or he won\u2019t. I can\u2019t tell which. \u2026 Or he can continue on his insult fest. That\u2019s a choice he\u2019s making.\u201d Tapper turns to a bit of policy himself. He asks about trade deals that Trump and Sanders have criticized at length for hurting manufacturing jobs. \u201cThey were mixed. They helped a lot of people and they hurt people,\u201d Clinton says. \u201cOne of the problems in our country is we don\u2019t do enough to help people who are hurt.\u201d Finally the host asks her about how she and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, attended the wedding of Donald and Melania Trump. Clinton laughs, and grins when she says that it \u201cnever crossed my mind\u201d that she could ever be running for president against the businessman. Hello and welcome to our rolling coverage of the 2016 primary election, the day after Barack Obama literally dropped the mic on Republicans, Democrats and the press, and only two days out from the crucial Indiana primary, which is likely the last realistic chance to block a former reality TV star from a clear path to his party\u2019s nomination. Donald Trump needs 1,237 delegates to clinch the Republican nomination at the party\u2019s convention in July, and party leaders in New Hampshire and elsewhere are trying to pack their contingents with anti-Trump Republicans. Trump\u2019s main rival, Texas senator Ted Cruz, has meanwhile invested huge efforts into Indiana, a state with politics so conservative that its voters may yet choose the widely loathed senator over the nationally disliked businessman. Trump did not attend the White House correspondents dinner on Saturday night, although he\u2019s been a guest before. \u201cIs this dinner too tacky for the Donald?\u201d Obama asked the crowd. \u201cWhat could he possibly be doing instead? Is he at home eating a Trump steak, tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel? What\u2019s he doing?\u201d Polls suggest the race is close: Cruz\u2019s well-organized team has tended to over-perform in states such as Indiana, and the state\u2019s rules mean whoever wins takes most of the delegates. Cruz himself will appear on nearly every Sunday talk show this morning to press his case that somehow he can be both America\u2019s most conservative leader and a unifying, definitely-not-despised-by-colleagues force in American politics. The Texas senator was not spared Obama\u2019s mockery, especially for his talk of a \u201cbasketball ring\u201d earlier this week. \u201cWhat else is in his lexicon? Baseball sticks? Football hats? But, sure, I\u2019m the foreign one.\u201d Cruz is also hampered by John Kasich, a third Republican candidate who trails by a huge margin in the race and who has lured more moderate conservatives to his comparatively more moderate cause. Without any realistic chance at the nomination, Kasich has largely been ignored by party leaders such as former House Speaker John Boehner and Senator Lindsey Graham. This week Boehner called Cruz \u201cLucifer in the flesh\u201d. On the Democratic side of the race, underdog Bernie Sanders has lost nearly any mathematical chance at the nomination in terms of pledged and unpledged delegates. He has vowed to continue the race through its final stages, however, and already turned toward converting his remarkable success \u2013 he often notes that he started a year ago at 3% in the polls \u2013 into a progressive agenda for the Democratic party at large. Obama joked that the 74-year-old Sanders is \u201cthe bright new face of the Democratic party\u201d. \u201cI am hurt, though, Bernie, that you\u2019ve been distancing yourself a little from me. I mean, that\u2019s just not something that you do to your comrade.\u201d The democratic socialist senator from Vermont began his campaign exactly one year ago today (May Day), and his mission may yet prove a defining factor even should the frontrunner secure the nomination, as seems likely. That frontrunner, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, has already turned her attention away from Sanders and toward Trump and the general election. Clinton has given a rare exclusive interview to CNN this morning, and will likely have to field questions about her thoughts on a potential running mate, even though the party remains months from the convention. Obama didn\u2019t spare his erstwhile cabinet member from a little teasing, and alluded to her hard road ahead uniting Sanders\u2019 passionate base of young people. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to admit it though, Hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative who just signed up for Facebook. \u201cObama out\u201d, the president declared on Saturday night, at ease with his nearing departure from the White House. We\u2019re in it for the long haul, so follow along to see how Trump, Cruz, Sanders and Clinton try to edge each other, redefine politics \u2013 and react to the presidential gibes at their expense.",

More than 7.4 million contributions have poured in from more than 2.4 million donors totaling $210 million.</p> <p>A key to Sanders\u2019 fundraising success has been that his grassroots supporters consistently have contributed more to his campaign than Hillary Clinton\u2019s big-dollar donors. Sanders\u2019 April donations far exceeded Hillary for America\u2019s $21 million in March.</p> <p>\u201cWhat our campaign is doing is bringing millions of Americans into the political process,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager. </p> <p>\u201cSanders is the candidate with the most energy and excitement. He is the candidate with the best chance of winning in November. He is the candidate who is in the best position to bring a new generation of voters into the democratic process and restore the faith of working-class voters that we can have a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Sanders\u2019 average contribution was a little less than $26, the campaign said, boasting that teachers, students, engineers and young people make up the largest blocs of donors.

      "bodyText": "For 13 years, Baghdad\u2019s green zone had been off limits to nearly all Iraqis; a place where wars have been run, power has been bitterly contested and from where the country\u2019s unaccountable leaders have filleted its finances. It had all taken place behind blast walls and barriers that gave the area, on the north bank of the Tigris river, an opaque and remote feel. The authority of the Iraqi state has long been centred in the green zone, even under Saddam Hussein, whose palaces were commandeered first by the US military, and now by Iraq\u2019s leaders. Not anymore. In one afternoon, the fragility of state control was exposed by the power of the street \u2013 and by a cleric who for several months earlier had shadow-boxed with the Iraqi leadership. With cover from their leader, Moqtada al-Sadr, thousands of men simply walked past soldiers who did not want to confront them, then ransacked the parliament and assaulted all the non-Sadrist MPs they could find. Iraq\u2019s legislature had three time refused to agree to reforms that would replace a corrupt cabinet with technocrats who could make vital changes without political, or personal, considerations. And, judging by the chaotic scenes of last week where the prime minister, Haidar al-Abadi, was chased from the floor of the parliament by MPs insisting on the status quo, that was not going to change. The defiance belied the crisis Iraq faces on multiple levels. Plunging oil revenues mean it will probably be unable to pay its bloated public sector payroll next year, a scenario that has sparked an overdue reckoning of systemic corruption and poor governance. Sectarian divisions, which have become ever more evident in the political system, have damaged the country\u2019s capacity to tackle a second existential threat, the rise of Islamic State \u2013 which claimed responsibility for a bomb attack that left at least 31 people dead in the southern Iraqi city of Samawah on Sunday. Without the lead role of non-state actors, such as Shia militias, Iran and US-led airstrikes, the terror group might have overrun Baghdad, just as it did four other cities: Mosul, Tikrit, Ramadi and Fallujah. At every turn, in the past five years in particular, the state has been unable to stand up for itself. The growing spectre of yet another issue, this time a financial crisis, that could have been avoided with the most basic of governance, has forced many to confront issues that could be, and were, buried during better times. At issue now, is the very viability of Iraq, as it was envisaged both by the neoconservative war planners in 2002, who saw a democratic, pluralistic utopia emerging from the US invasion, and by those who founded the modern state nearly 95 years ago, assembling disparate groups under the banner of a nation state. For the first time in the 13 years since the US invasion gave power to the majority Shia sect at the expense of the minority Sunnis, public officials are starting to talk openly about a future state that is not bound by the same borders or political system. Partition had been almost a taboo topic among the country\u2019s political class, even during the worst of the sectarian war from 2006-07 and the early months of the Isis onslaught in 2014. Last year, however, Ali al-Sistani, the highest authority in Iraqi Shia Islam, publicly said such an outcome was possible, if reforms were not made. Sistani, a recluse, who throughout his life has rarely delved into politics, has been increasingly forthright in pushing Abadi to introduce change. Those close to Sistani say the 87-year-old sees the crisis as a last chance for the modern state, and for nationalists who want to keep it together. Throughout the Baghdad establishment there is an increasing fear that restoring meaningful unity may already be out of reach. Iraq, as it is now, is all but ungovernable, with vested interests holding sway over reformists, and with militias having primacy over state institutions. The greater fear is what this might all mean for the region. The consideration now for Iraq, as well as its allies and foes, is whether continuing to pretend it is working is a better option than acknowledging it isn\u2019t.",

    "webTitle": "Protesters in Iraq's green zone begin to withdraw", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Up to 5,000 demonstrators who set up camp in the heart of Baghdad\u2019s fortified green zone began to leave after protest leaders delivered an ultimatum that called for an overhaul of Iraq\u2019s crippled government, and vowed to return if reforms failed. The withdrawal on Sunday was ordered by senior leaders of the Sadrist movement, whose members had walked past soldiers into the most secure part of the Iraqi capital over the weekend, in the most dramatic challenge to state authority in post-Saddam Iraq. As they trickled from the heart of Iraqi power, the Sadrist leaders, who are loyal to the powerful Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, demanded an urgent parliamentary session to form a new cabinet. Failing that, they insisted on the sacking of the prime minister, Haider al-Abadi; the president, Fuad Masum; and the speaker, Salim al-Jabouri, as well as new elections. Observers said implacable divisions within Iraq\u2019s parliament \u2013 which has rejected a reform programme introduced by an embattled Abadi three times \u2013 have made it close to impossible to agree to reforms, meaning the crisis is likely to escalate again. Soldiers who guard the green zone stood aside as senior members of the powerful Shia militia, Saraya al Salam, vetted new arrivals to the protests on Sunday, in another sign of the deference of Iraqi institutions to religious authority. Earlier on Sunday, Abadi ordered authorities to arrest and prosecute the protesters who had attacked security forces and lawmakers and damaged state property after breaking into the green zone. No arrests were reported. Demonstrators gathered near sites that had remained off-limits to most Iraqis for the past 13 years, insisting they would not leave until the political torpor that has crippled the country and widespread corruption that has whittled its finances is somehow resolved. After ransacking parts of the parliament on Saturday and attacking the cars of some fleeing MPs, protests were orderly on Sunday. Security forces cordoned off some areas leading to official palaces, military headquarters, UN bases, and embassies, with protest leaders insisting that earlier vandalism would not be repeated. Abadi\u2019s latest attempt to introduce changes, which centre on replacing his largely corrupt cabinet with technocrats tasked with guiding the country out of myriad crises, ended in chaos last week \u2013 the third time his authority had been defied by the legislature. Iraq is plagued by endemic corruption, the effects of which have come into sharp focus as oil revenues plummet due to structural changes in global oil prices that have slashed budget revenues by up to 70 %. Political decision-making has also been paralysed by incessant power struggles that take precedence over governance and have left many Iraqis convinced official institutions serve only the country\u2019s elite. Demonstrators who gathered near crossed swords that bookended a Saddam-era parade ground chanted against the Iranian military leader, Gen Qassem Suleimani, who wields huge power in Baghdad, and is a rival power base to Abadi. After 24 hours inside an area he was unable to visit even during the rule of the ousted dictator, demonstrator Ahmed Moussawi, 29, said he was now convinced that Iraq\u2019s leaders were pampered and unaccountable. \u201cI tell you, I saw a power station, which gives them 24 hours electricity. I saw more new cars than you could dream about, villas and palaces, open roads. It\u2019s a dream in here,\u201d he said, referring to the green zone. Others spoke of a \u201cstepping through the looking-glass experience\u201d. \u201cCompared to Sadr City, this is a paradise,\u201d said Ali al-Ali, a resident of a sprawling impoverished area in Baghdad\u2019s north. \u201cSo this is where they count all the money? They need those big GMCs [four-wheel drive vehicles] to carry it all away.\u201d Officials who remained in the green zone were in lockdown on Sunday. Many MPs fled to Baghdad airport on Saturday night, where they took flights to the Kurdish north and Basra. Embassies remained fully staffed, but the UK and US governments said they were monitoring developments carefully. A western resident of the green zone said the mood on the streets was non- threatening. \u201cI had to come to the UN compound and saw more people who seemed to have just arrived and [were] headed to the interior. Everyone seemed really calm. Some of the security forces were sitting on the grassy areas and some were resting.\u201d But a senior aide to one of Iraq\u2019s leaders said: \u201cThe situation is very dangerous right now. Sadr is trying to push his own cabinet, which he claims to be independent to take over the majority of the ministries. But we all know that there isn\u2019t anyone who is independent in Iraq. \u201cIraqis have to give loyalty to someone or a group and of course it will be the same group who in turn support them and give them power. \u201cSadr and Maliki [Iraq\u2019s former prime minister Nouri al-Maliki] are both instigating the problem and each one is playing the independent card, but they are both fighting for power. Each wants to prove his loyalty to the public. I can say that there will be a need to form an emergency government.\u201d Baghdad-based political analyst Ihsan Al-Shimari said: \u201cThis actually shows that Baghdad has fallen again. The protesters lost their rights when they invaded the parliament and attacked the MPs. Many MPs were attacked, except those loyal to Sadr. \u201cMost of the political parties aren\u2019t nationalists and no one is looking for the country\u2019s interest. The Iraqi street is now split between agreeing on the protests and being against it. Some consider Abadi\u2019s position as weak but I think he tried to deal with the situation wisely. If there are any more incidents with the protesters then this will bring the violence to a different level.\u201d Earlier on Sunday, car bombs in the southern Iraqi city of Samawah killed 31 people and wounded dozens, the latest in a series of large attacks claimed by Islamic State as the country grapples with the worsening political crisis.",

      "bodyText": "The fairytale ending to Leicester\u2019s tilt at the Premier League title may have to wait a day, a week, or a fortnight. But there was still an unwavering sense of optimism on the city\u2019s streets on Sunday, even after the anticlimatic 1-1 draw with Manchester United, about everyone\u2019s favourite underdogs getting the job done. The crowds crammed into every available space across Leicester to watch the action from Old Trafford, white and blue bunting adorned street corners and a sea of blue could be seen in the bars and pubs. Their team did not win but this did little to dampen the spirits and the only feeling among the thousands that turned out in support was that they were going to have the celebration of a lifetime \u2013 there had just been a slight delay. As the match drew to a close chants of \u201cwe\u2019re going to win the league\u201d continued to resound through the city as supporters made their way home with smiles on their faces. However, the mood is mixed about just how the victory should be secured. Those of a more nervous temperament, like lifetime Leicester City supporter Dave Ruddy, 55, want it all to be over on Monday night when, if Tottenham draw or lose against Chelsea, the Premier League trophy will be heading to the east Midlands. \u201cIt was such a great day today because I have been following them all my life and they played so well. I\u2019m not disappointed at all about today but now it would be good if it was secured tomorrow night,\u201d he said. But there are those, including the first citizen himself, mayor Peter Soulsby, who want to bask in the glory of a win at Leicester\u2019s home ground next Saturday, against Everton. The win would set into motion days of celebration that are being kept \u201ctop secret\u201d by the city council, according to Soulsby. \u201cI think we knew it was going to be a difficult match \u2013 it was away and against Man United and it was never going to be a walkover,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are so proud of them \u2013 they could have crumbled when United scored that early goal but they didn\u2019t \u2013 they held firm and scored.\u201d Soulsby, who has a ticket to next Saturday\u2019s match, said he, like many other locals, would be watching Monday\u2019s game on a sofa and he wants to celebrate in earnest next Saturday with a win at Leicester\u2019s King Power stadium. \u201cIt did not quite happen today. On one hand I do want to get it settled but then on the other we would like to have a huge celebration next Saturday. Either way I\u2019m confident that they will win but I\u2019m not going to jinx it and we will also reveal the city\u2019s celebration plans once the final whistle blows,\u201d he added. Sunday\u2019s match, and now the extra wait, is particularly agonising for 20-year-old student Karishma Kapoor, who placed a \u00a32 bet at odds of 5,000/1 for Leicester to win the Premier League at the beginning of the season and could win \u00a310,000, but must now wait another 24 hours. Or longer. Kapoor, who placed the bet with Ladbrokes on 8 August last year, was philosophical abount the day\u2019s events and said she was confident that Leicester would bring the title home. The life-long Leicester fan said: \u201cWe looked at the odds online and just had to do it when we saw that they were 5,000/1. Me and my auntie who I placed the bet with will share the winnings.\u201d Kapoor, who refused an offer from Ladbrokes to cash out at \u00a39,000 following the Manchester United result, is confident the team will win. She said: \u201cThe atmosphere has been amazing. Everyone is rooting for Leicester to win. We are very close now.\u201d Her optimism was shared by the Mistry family, who are planning another visit to the same pub, the Local Hero, for the Tottenham game. If the north London side, currently second, are still in the hunt after their trip to Stamford Bridge, Leicester will need two points from their remaining games \u2013 a win or two draws from the Everton match and their own trip to Chelsea the weekend after next \u2013 to make the fairytale reality. Engineer Dennis, 46, who watched Sunday\u2019s match with his fashion designer wife, Alpa, 47 and their two children Venetia and Cian, said it had been the best family day out. He said: \u201cThe place has just been absolutely thumping and the whole city has come together to support our team. It has been such a unbelievable few months and we are so proud to come from Leicester. Now we just need to finish the deal and then we can really celebrate.\u201d",

Saracens are not afraid of that little quirk of history and they confirmed their position as table-toppers with this win over Newcastle, securing their first-seed status for the play-offs in what is surely the longest, most arduous seeding mechanism in sport. Saracens look the likeliest top seeds to buck the trend since, well, the last time they finished top, two years ago, when they yielded the title to Northampton, courtesy of a last-minute-of-extra-time try in the final.

Craig Willis\u2019s little chip to set him up for it was a thing of beauty. It appeared at that point Newcastle were about to secure their Premiership status in style.

I just thought the side was too good for it.\u201d But not yet good enough to prevail against the league leaders. Saracens changed their props at half-time, and the effect was pronounced. The variety of ways they can go about the business of winning marks them out. The sparkling stuff was not available, so they reverted to the slow, painful stuff. Three tries followed. Jackson Wray scored the first two, by which Saracens established a lead before the third quarter was out. For the third he slipped the ball to Maro Itoje, who plunged over with 10 minutes to go. Their grip on that second half was vice-like.

      "bodyText": "The late Christopher Hitchens observed in his 2010 Daniel Pearl Memorial Lecture that antisemitism is often a \u201cleading symptom\u201d of \u201cschizophrenia and paranoia\u201d. It is, if you will, a sign of sickness, personal or institutional. And this is the broader significance of the collective crisis into which Labour has plunged in the past week: the party is sick. Let us first acknowledge that antisemitism is not by any reckoning a moral stain exclusive to the left. In a diary entry for December 1987, Alan Clark describes a dinner of senior Tories at the Savoy in which the rumour that Nigel Lawson may become foreign secretary is discussed: \u201cThis seems a pretty tall order to me \u2026 we couldn\u2019t quite swallow it.\u201d It is no less revealing that Michael Howard \u2013 one of the most talented politicians of his generation and a practising Jew \u2013 had to apply to more than 40 seats before he was accepted as a Tory parliamentary candidate. So antisemitism has long lurked across the political spectrum, as likely to arise and metastasise on the right as on the left. All the same, it is idle to pretend, as Diane Abbott did on The Andrew Marr Show today, that the present row engulfing Labour is all \u201ca smear\u201d. Yesterday Ken Livingstone had made the same laughable argument in an LBC interview \u2013 blaming a conspiracy of \u201cembittered old Blairites\u201d. Were these grizzled Friends of Tony also behind the anti-Zionist tweet posted by Piers Corbyn, the party leader\u2019s brother, or the hugely offensive articles shared by Naz Shah, the Labour MP for Bradford West, calling for the \u201ctransportation\u201d of Israelis to America? Livingstone was suspended from Labour on Thursday after claiming that Hitler had supported Zionism \u201cbefore he went mad and ended up killing 6&nbsp;million Jews\u201d. Which just goes to show that a little learning is indeed a dangerous thing. It will be news to anyone with more than a cosmetic knowledge of Hitler\u2019s biography that he was a sane leader before Reinhard Heydrich launched the \u201cfinal solution\u201d at the Wannsee conference in 1942. In Mein Kampf, 17 years before, Hitler had declared that the first world war might have been won by Germany if 12,000 or 15,000 \u201cof these Hebrew corrupters of the people had been held under poison gas\u201d. History records not a moment when Hitler \u201cwent mad\u201d but a chillingly genocidal continuity. I assume that what Livingstone had grasped in hopelessly garbled form is the notion, depressingly common in the pre-war chanceries of Europe, that the diaspora Jews could, or should be, sent elsewhere. One destination under discussion was Madagascar \u2013 giving rise to the slogan Madagassez les Juifs. In Germany, there was the Haavara \u2013 transfer \u2013 agreement of 1933, that enabled German Jews to go to Palestine. But Hitler was never keen on this system, precisely because it would enable the race he most despised to gain a foothold in a region of great geopolitical importance. He wanted rid of the Jews, by any means necessary. There is a world of difference between that hate-driven ambition and the longing for a homeland that animates true Zionism. The core of Livingstone\u2019s argument is a familiar one: \u201ca real antisemite doesn\u2019t just hate the Jews in Israel, they hate their Jewish neighbour in Golders Green or in Stoke Newington. It\u2019s a physical loathing.\u201d Do we surmise from this that he actually hates Israeli Jews? What is certain is that he deploys the standard defence: anti-Zionism is not coterminous with antisemitism. One can dislike Israel without disliking Jews. Praying in aid an obscure text by the American Marxist Lenni Brenner, Livingstone says he has facts on his side. He may wish to broaden his reading before he is invited to defend himself \u2013 recent work such as (for example) Timothy Snyder\u2019s Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning or the late David Cesarani\u2019s Final Solution: The Fate of the Jews 1933-49. Above all, he should look at Anthony Julius\u2019s masterly history of antisemitism in England, Trials of the Diaspora (2010), which reveals, beyond reasonable doubt, the fibres of language, emotion and doctrine that connect hostility to Israel and hostility to Jews. As Julius puts it: \u201cLong-standing antisemites now embrace \u2018anti-Zionism\u2019 as a cover for their Jew-hatred. This is because, in relation to Israel, the antisemite finds a protected voice \u2026 Anti-Zionism has renewed antisemitism, and given it a future.\u201d The tropes are the same: for \u201cJewish cabal\u201d read \u201cIsrael lobby\u201d. For the old hatred of the stateless Jew, read the campaign to deny Israel any legitimacy. For the old boycotts of Jewish shops and services, read the boycotts of Israeli academia. For superstitious fear of Jews, read the modern, politically illiterate claim that Islamism would wither on the vine if not for the supposedly wicked deeds of Israel, a claim that, as Julius argues, \u201cwildly overstates the significance of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in world affairs \u2013 indeed it puts Jews at the centre of world affairs\u201d. In spite of its initial dither, the Labour leadership now claims to be on top of the problem. Shah and Livingstone are both suspended, and Corbyn has launched an inquiry, under Shami Chakrabarti, to investigate antisemitism and other forms of racism in the party. The problem for the hard left \u2013 presently in the ascendant \u2013 is that its adherents do not regard antisemitism as equivalent to other forms of racism. For some who hail from the same ideological background as Corbyn and Livingstone, racism is a subset and consequence of capitalism and imperialism. In this worldview, most Jewish people are caricatured as friends of capital and all Israelis are agents of imperialism. It is therefore doctrinally difficult \u2013 perhaps impossible \u2013 for this section of the left to see Jews as victims. To which one can only say: let them go to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, and recall what Hitler \u2013 the man Livingstone calls a Zionist \u2013 did to the most persecuted people in history. In the past I compared Corbyn\u2019s leadership to Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s short reign over the Tory party. In 2001 IDS was horrified by the antisemitism of the rightwing Monday Club\u2019s literature and drove this squalid gang out of his party, in spite of pleas for leniency from some traditionalist Tories. Now Corbyn must show symmetrical toughness. He may not, as he insists, be an antisemite. The open question is whether he is really a leader.",

In Mein Kampf, 17 years before, Hitler had declared that the first world war might have been won by Germany if 12,000 or 15,000 \u201c<a href=\"http://ww2history.com/key_moments/Holocaust/Hitler_talks_of_Jewish_annihilation\" title=\"\">of these Hebrew corrupters of the people had been held under poison gas</a>\u201d. History records not a moment when Hitler \u201cwent mad\u201d but a chillingly genocidal continuity.</p> <p>I assume that what Livingstone had grasped in hopelessly garbled form is the notion, depressingly common in the pre-war chanceries of Europe, that the diaspora Jews could, or should be, sent elsewhere. One destination under discussion was Madagascar \u2013 giving rise to the slogan <em>Madagassez les Juifs</em>. In Germany, there was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/30/livingstone-muddies-history-to-support-hitler-and-zionism-claims\" title=\"\"><em>Haavara</em> \u2013 transfer \u2013 agreement of 1933</a>, that enabled German Jews to go to Palestine. But Hitler was never keen on this system, precisely because it would enable the race he most despised to gain a foothold in a region of great geopolitical importance. He wanted rid of the Jews, by any means necessary. There is a world of difference between that hate-driven ambition and the longing for a homeland that animates true Zionism.</p> <p>The core of Livingstone\u2019s argument is a familiar one: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/04/real-antisemite-doesn-t-just-hate-jews-israel-ken-livingstone-s\" title=\"\">a real antisemite doesn\u2019t just hate the Jews in Israel</a>, they hate their Jewish neighbour in Golders Green or in Stoke Newington. It\u2019s a physical loathing.\u201d Do we surmise from this that he actually hates Israeli Jews? What is certain is that he deploys the standard defence: anti-Zionism is not coterminous with antisemitism. One can dislike Israel without disliking Jews.</p> <p>Praying in aid an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/29/ken-livingstone-marxist-book-lenni-brenner-defence-israel-comments\" title=\"\">obscure text by the American Marxist Lenni Brenner</a>, Livingstone says he has facts on his side. He may wish to broaden his reading before he is invited to defend himself \u2013 recent work such as (for example) Timothy Snyder\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/13/black-earth-timothy-snyder-review-the-holocaust-as-history-and-warning-chilling-timely-instructive\" title=\"\">Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning</a> or the late David Cesarani\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/final-solution-6.html\" title=\"\">Final Solution: The Fate of the Jews 1933-49</a>.</p> <p>Above all, he should look at Anthony Julius\u2019s masterly history of antisemitism in England, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/27/trials-of-the-diaspora-julius\" title=\"\">Trials of the Diaspora</a> (2010), which reveals, beyond reasonable doubt, the fibres of language, emotion and doctrine that connect hostility to Israel and hostility to Jews. As Julius puts it: \u201cLong-standing antisemites now embrace \u2018anti-Zionism\u2019 as a cover for their Jew-hatred. This is because, in relation to Israel, the antisemite finds a protected voice \u2026 Anti-Zionism has renewed antisemitism, and given it a future.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The hard left - presently in the ascendant \u2013 does not regard antisemitism as equivalent to other forms of racism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The tropes are the same: for \u201cJewish cabal\u201d read \u201cIsrael lobby\u201d. For the old hatred of the stateless Jew, read the campaign to deny Israel any legitimacy. For the old boycotts of Jewish shops and services, read the boycotts of Israeli academia. For superstitious fear of Jews, read the modern, politically illiterate claim that Islamism would wither on the vine if not for the supposedly wicked deeds of Israel, a claim that, as Julius argues, \u201cwildly overstates the significance of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in world affairs \u2013 indeed it puts Jews at the centre of world affairs\u201d.</p> <p>In spite of its initial dither, the Labour leadership now claims to be on top of the problem. Shah and Livingstone are both suspended, and Corbyn has launched an inquiry, under Shami Chakrabarti, to investigate antisemitism and other forms of racism in the party.</p> <p>The problem for the hard left \u2013 presently in the ascendant \u2013 is that its adherents do not regard antisemitism as equivalent to other forms of racism. For some who hail from the same ideological background as Corbyn and Livingstone, racism is a subset and consequence of capitalism and imperialism. In this worldview, most Jewish people are caricatured as friends of capital and all Israelis are agents of imperialism. It is therefore doctrinally difficult \u2013 perhaps impossible \u2013 for this section of the left to see Jews as victims. To which one can only say: let them go to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2011/jan/27/yad-vashem-archive-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Yad Vashem</a>, the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, and recall what Hitler \u2013 the man Livingstone calls a Zionist \u2013 did to the most persecuted people in history.</p> <p>In the past I compared Corbyn\u2019s leadership to Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s short reign over the Tory party. In 2001 IDS was horrified by the antisemitism of the rightwing Monday Club\u2019s literature and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/oct/19/uk.race\" title=\"\">drove this squalid gang out of his party</a>, in spite of pleas for leniency from some traditionalist Tories. Now Corbyn must show symmetrical toughness. He may not, as he insists, be an antisemite. The open question is whether he is really a leader.</p>",

He was the overseas batsman here two years ago, quietly scoring his fair share of runs between opening the batting for South Africa. The international days have now gone, so perhaps Lancashire have the better deal. Petersen recognised the most benign of pitches, shorn of the grass that is needed to produce pace here, which may be one of the downsides of the new regulations at the toss, and he calmly set about gathering his runs. He had netted 83 of them when, to some surprise, he was leg-before to Craig Overton, armed with the second new ball. Until then Petersen had barely missed anything. Nonetheless he had done enough to steer his side into a strong position. At the close Lancashire were 295 for 4. With a win in their solitary match so far in a spring when victories are as rare as cuckoos, they do not look overawed to be back in the first division, even if they are more competent than cavalier when compiling their runs. A toss was clearly necessary because this was obviously a bat-first pitch, the type that is more usually seen in August on a tired square than in May in the first home match of the season. After an hour the left-arm spinner Jack Leach was introduced from the River End and he proceeded to bowl 19 consecutive overs, not because the ball was turning but because there was nothing happening for the faster bowlers. This was not what those introducing the new toss regulations were aiming for or so one must hope. Leach claimed the first two wickets either side of lunch. Haseeb Hameed, a promising 19-year-old who has come through the national under-19 ranks, had oozed competence until he drove a catch to short extra cover, a reward for Leach\u2019s persistence. His opening partner, Karl Brown, was lbw propping forward in the modern way after the interval. Then Luke Procter played round a straight delivery from Tim Groenewald so that the door was briefly ajar for Somerset. But Petersen and Steven Croft were able to double the score, moving seamlessly from dutiful watchfulness to expanding their repertoire just before the new ball was due. Petersen changed gear against the admirable Leach, who has only just recovered from a stress fracture and is therefore short of bowling (something which will be remedied in this match). A slog-sweep and an on-drive cleared boundaries that are even shorter than usual as the outfield recovers from the laying of a new drainage system. The Overtons bounded in but struggled to extract much life from the surface. As ever Jamie bowled the fastest deliveries while Craig was more frequently on target. By the end of the day Jamie was reduced to banging the ball into the middle of the pitch, which proved a fruitless exercise. Still, the Quantocks, which can be seen to greater advantage from the swish new press box at the top of Somerset\u2019s latest pavilion, remained gloriously visible throughout an overcast day. Moreover, it was so warm in there that the air conditioning had to be switched on. It was a little cooler out in the middle, where only the batsmen hinted at contentment.",

Ranieri will be flying back from Italy instead, having visited his 96-year-old mother, Renata, for lunch and will be, by his own admission, \u201cthe last man to know the result\u201d. While Ranieri is boarding a flight from Rome, Spurs will go to Stamford Bridge knowing that anything other than an away win would mean the championship being decided on the back of Leicester\u2019s 1-1 draw at Manchester United, a game that finished with Marouane Fellaini facing a possible three-match ban and Louis van Gaal accusing Robert Huth of adopting behaviour acceptable \u201conly with sex masochism\u201d. Van Gaal\u2019s argument was that Huth had pulled Fellaini\u2019s hair, provoking the Belgian into elbowing his opponent, and United\u2019s manager made his point by doing the same off-camera to a television reporter. Ranieri was far less abrasive after a result that leaves his team eight points clear of Spurs and with the opportunity, at the very worst, to clinch the title by beating Everton at the King Power Stadium on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019d like to watch the game but I am on a flight back from Italy,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cI want to meet my mother, who is 96 years old, and go for lunch with her. I fly back at the same time as the match. So I won\u2019t know the result. But when we land I will hear.\u201d Anthony Martial had given United an early lead but Wes Morgan equalised nine minutes later, before the midfielder Danny Drinkwater was sent off late on for his second bookable offence. \u201cI am very sad because he will miss the next game at home,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cI hope I will not miss him. Otherwise I am so happy because we drew against a fantastic Manchester United side. \u201cWe suffered a lot because they pressed so high and without [Jamie] Vardy it was difficult to stretch the line. Psychologically it was very important to come back and, after that, we were a little more calm, moving the ball quickly and doing what we spoke about in the week.\u201d Drinkwater\u2019s second booking came from a tug on Memphis Depay when the United substitute had his foot on the perimeter line of the penalty area. The referee, Michael Oliver, awarded only a free-kick but Leicester had their own grievances when an earlier penalty appeal for Marcos Rojo\u2019s challenge on Riyad Mahrez was waved away and Fellaini was fortunate that his elbow on Huth was apparently not seen. \u201cWhen you see what Huth is doing to Fellaini, that\u2019s a penalty,\u201d Van Gaal argued. \u201cShall I grab you by your hair? What is your reaction when I grab your hair? [Grabs reporter\u2019s hair off camera.] Your hair is shorter than Fellaini but when I do that, what are you doing then? It\u2019s a reaction. Every human being who is grabbed by the hair [reacts]. Only with sex masochism it is allowed but not in other situations.\u201d Van Gaal\u2019s argument is unlikely to spare his player retrospective action and the United manager was angry to learn that Fellaini, a player notorious for elbowing offences, might face such action and a possible three-match ban from the Football Association. \u201cThen I expect, firstly, that Huth shall be getting a lot [of suspended games] because I don\u2019t think that is normal what he is doing,\u201d he said. \u201cFellaini is reacting like a human being because if I grab your hair and pull it backwards, you would also do something to me, I believe. They did it several times, I think, and the reaction of Fellaini was of a human being.\u201d Manchester City\u2019s defeat at Southampton means United are four points off the fourth Champions League qualification place. Van Gaal\u2019s team have a game in hand but the Dutchman was frustrated by their inability to build on their early lead. \u201cI have said to my players that I have seen one of the best matches of the season from my lineup but it was not enough. You have to score when you are so attacking and creating so many chances, as we did in the first half, and when you concede a set-play goal, again, that is a pity.\u201d",

What is your reaction when I grab your hair? [Grabs reporter\u2019s hair off camera.] Your hair is shorter than Fellaini but when I do that, what are you doing then? It\u2019s a reaction. Every human being who is grabbed by the hair [reacts]. Only with sex masochism it is allowed but not in other situations.\u201d</p> <p>Van Gaal\u2019s argument is unlikely to spare his player retrospective action and the United manager was angry to learn that Fellaini, a player notorious for elbowing offences, might face such action and a possible three-match ban from the Football Association.</p> <p>\u201cThen I expect, firstly, that Huth shall be getting a lot [of suspended games] because I don\u2019t think that is normal what he is doing,\u201d he said. \u201cFellaini is reacting like a human being because if I grab your hair and pull it backwards, you would also do something to me, I believe. They did it several times, I think, and the reaction of Fellaini was of a human being.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/01/southampton-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Manchester City\u2019s defeat at Southampton</a> means United are four points off the fourth Champions League qualification place. Van Gaal\u2019s team have a game in hand but the Dutchman was frustrated by their inability to build on their early lead. \u201cI have said to my players that I have seen one of the best matches of the season from my lineup but it was not enough. You have to score when you are so attacking and creating so many chances, as we did in the first half, and when you concede a set-play goal, again, that is a pity.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wasps were such a distant second in the battle for second place that they used the final minutes here to run down the clock and prevent Exeter from securing the bonus point their dominance throughout merited. If both sides win their final-round matches at the weekend, they will return here for the play-off semi-final. It is a ground where Wasps have yet to win in the Premiership, mustering a mere two bonus points in six visits. The manner of their latest defeat, subdued in possession by a defence that, led by the immovable flanker Dave Ewers, advanced off the line in relentless waves, clobbering the ball-carrier with devastating hits to prevent offloads, that even their talisman Nathan Hughes found himself going backwards. With Exeter, who gave Wasps the first use of the strong wind and enjoyed the bonus of seeing their opponents only kick for position twice despite making no attacking headway, never relaxing the iron grip they took on the game from the opening minutes, the visitors had almost no mistakes to exploit. Chiefs kicked long or into touch to prevent counterattacks and rarely offloaded, forcing Wasps to attack with their own possession and a back division that has lit up the Premiership this season operated in the dark. Wasps made just two, brief, visits to Exeter\u2019s 22, their only points coming from a wind-assisted Elliot Daly penalty from just inside his own half. From the moment the Exeter hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie hurled himself at Hughes in the opening exchanges and hauled down the No8, the home side gave their opponents no time on the ball. Ewers and Mitch Lees were around one corner with Don Armand and Ben Moon patrolling the other and if Wasps had an excuse that Exeter had taken the previous weekend off while they were engaged in a European Cup semi-final with Saracens, it was not one grasped by their director of rugby, Dai Young, nor did it explain why for the third match in a row they offered little in attack. The better teams have worked them out and they need to respond. Wasps did rectify one weakness. Exeter kicked five penalties to touch to drive mauls, but did not get one into gear, unlike the first meeting between the sides last December when the ploy won them the game. Along with a steady scrum, it gave them something to take from one of their worst performances of the season. Young said he could not fault the effort of his players, but in terms of intent, focus and energy, Exeter were always a step ahead, from their opening try on 27 minutes when the scrum-half Will Chudley surprised Wasps by scooping the ball from a long-range driving maul and passing it to Olly Woodburn who appeared to have nowhere to go with Frank Halai in front of him, but he crumpled on impact and Chiefs were on their way. Their interval lead of 7-3 would probably have been greater had they chosen to kick for goal one of the four penalties they had sent into touch but they had Wasps where they wanted them. \u201cI knew we would win at half-time,\u201d said Chiefs\u2019 head coach, Rob Baxter, who had told his players in the week to embrace their status as one of England\u2019s leading clubs as the season built to its climax, and not be overawed by it. Baxter got the response he wanted. Gareth Steenson\u2019s penalty three minutes into the second half took Exeter into double figures and, as they consistently put phases together, gaps started to appear in Wasps\u2019 defence out wide. The pressure told on 58 minutes when Ian Whitten and Phil Dollman exchanged passes for the latter to break Daly\u2019s tackle on his way to the line. Seven minutes later Woodburn\u2019s replacement James Short thought he had scored a try in a moment that summed up the game. When Steenson kicked deep into Wasps\u2019 22 from halfway, a drop-out seemed the likely outcome, but as Christian Wade dallied and the replacement Rob Miller dithered, Short pounced having covered half the length of the pitch and appeared to the naked eye to have applied downward pressure ahead of Miller as the ball reached the line. The television match official, Graham Hughes, ruled Miller\u2019s and Short\u2019s contact had been simultaneous. Exeter had a scrum instead of a try but they were not kept out for long and another ineffective tackle led to their third touch down, Ruaridh Jackson remonstrating with himself after clutching feebly as the England wing Jack Nowell went past him. There was enough time for one more penalty to be turned into a driving maul and a potential bonus point but Wasps held firm and used the final 90 seconds to pick and go and eat up what time remained. \u201cWe have got to mix things up more in possession and get our game going again,\u201d Young said. \u201cI could not fault the effort of the players because without it we would have had our trousers pulled down.\u201d Exeter Dollman (Hill, 65); Nowell, Slade, Whitten, Woodburn (Short, 59); Steenson (capt), Chudley (Lewis, 65); Moon (Hepburn, 59), Cowan-Dickie (Yeandle, 73), Williams (Rimmer, 73), Lees (Welch, 67), Parling, Ewers (Waldrom, 62), Salvi, Armand.

      "bodyText": "Barack Obama\u2019s daughter Malia will take a year off after high school and attend Harvard University in 2017, the White House announced on Sunday. The 17-year-old is a senior at the elite Sidwell Friends School, in Washington, the same high school where the children and grandchildren of the Clintons, Roosevelts, Bidens and Gores have attended. Malia Obama graduates in June and will celebrate her 18th birthday on the Fourth of July. The president recently said he declined an invitation to speak at the graduation ceremony. \u201cI\u2019m going to be wearing dark glasses, sobbing,\u201d he told talk show host Ellen DeGeneres earlier this year. \u201cI\u2019m going to cry.\u201d Malia visited at least a dozen public and private colleges during her search, including Princeton and Columbia, where her parents earned undergraduate degrees. Harvard encourages new admissions to take a gap year before or during their undergraduate years, so that the students can pursue work experience outside school. For the school\u2019s most famous new freshman, the year off could mean less attention when she does start classes in 2017, and time to build her resume. First lady Michelle Obama has said that Malia hopes to become a film-maker, and that she worked last summer in New York as an intern on the set of the HBO show Girls. She spent the previous summer as a production assistant for CBS, and held previous internships at the National Zoo in Washington. Harvard accepted 5.2% of applicants this year, the lowest acceptance rate in its history. The school has been home to a long list of American leaders and their children: children of Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the Kennedys attended the school, and five of the eight sitting supreme court justices studied at its law school. Obama has said he intends to stay in Washington after he leaves the White House until his youngest daughter, Sasha, graduates from high school in 2019. Even so, the first family has remained quiet about their plans after inauguration day on 20 January 2017, when someone else takes to the Oval Office. \u201cWe haven\u2019t figured that out yet,\u201d he told voters in Wisconsin earlier this year. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to stay a couple of years so Sasha can finish.\u201d Though usually extremely private, the president opened up to DeGeneres about his close relationship with his daughter. \u201cI\u2019m not ready for her to leave,\u201dhe said. \u201cShe\u2019s one of my best friends. It\u2019s going to be hard for me not to have her around all the time, but she\u2019s ready to go. She\u2019s just a really smart, capable person and she\u2019s ready to make her own way.\u201d The Obamas have announced that his presidential library will be built on the south side of Chicago, where he lived and worked before seeking public office.",

For the school\u2019s most famous new freshman, the year off could mean less attention when she does start classes in 2017, and time to build her resume. </p> <p>First lady Michelle Obama has said that Malia hopes to become a film-maker, and that she worked last summer in New York as an intern on the set of the HBO show Girls. She spent the previous summer as a production assistant for CBS, and held previous internships at the National Zoo in Washington.</p> <p>Harvard accepted 5.2% of applicants this year, the lowest acceptance rate in its history. The school has been home to a long list of American leaders and their children: children of Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the Kennedys attended the school, and five of the eight sitting supreme court justices studied at its law school.</p> <p>Obama has said he intends to stay in Washington after he leaves the White House until his youngest daughter, Sasha, graduates from high school in 2019. Even so, the first family has remained quiet about their plans after inauguration day on 20 January 2017, when someone else takes to the Oval Office.</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t figured that out yet,\u201d he told voters in Wisconsin earlier this year. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to stay a couple of years so Sasha can finish.\u201d</p> <p>Though usually extremely private, the president opened up to DeGeneres about his close relationship with his daughter. \u201cI\u2019m not ready for her to leave,\u201dhe said. \u201cShe\u2019s one of my best friends. It\u2019s going to be hard for me not to have her around all the time, but she\u2019s ready to go. She\u2019s just a really smart, capable person and she\u2019s ready to make her own way.\u201d</p> <p>The Obamas have announced that his presidential library will be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/12/barack-obama-presidential-library-chicago-south-side\">built on the south side of Chicago</a>, where he lived and worked before seeking public office. </p>",

      "bodyText": "This may not have been the most surprising result of the weekend or even the most significant but, for St Helens, it was another indicator they are slowly piecing their season back together. Plagued by inconsistency and injuries during the opening three months of the season, this felt like a game Keiron Cunningham\u2019s side could easily have lost several weeks ago, not least when they were trailing by eight points heading into the final quarter. But as Cunningham\u2019s big players return from lengthy injury layoffs, the Saints are starting to find ways to win games. They edged out Leeds in a similarly close contest last week and this was another such victory, which suggests that, even though they are not quite at their best yet, St Helens do have the makings of a top-four side this season. Mark Percival, Atelea Vea and Jonny Lomax have all given Cunningham\u2019s side an undoubted lift, with Lomax\u2019s return after over a year out with a serious knee injury again grabbing a large amount of the headlines with the late try that ultimately sealed victory, with the Saints now two points off the top four following results elsewhere this weekend. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the win but we can play better,\u201d warned Cunningham afterwards. \u201cBut winning can become a habit. It\u2019s two in a row for us now and that\u2019s pleasing. When you start to get your key players back you can forge better combinations, as you could see today.\u201d And those words from Cunningham will offer hope for his opposite number, Daryl Powell, who is still without eight frontline players himself. For an hour here they were on a par with St Helens but the absences seemed to catch up with the hosts in the final quarter, as well as another injury, this time to the prop, Andy Lynch. They remain in eighth, only four points above the bottom four, but despite a worrying run of form,the Castleford coach refused to panic post-match. \u201cIf we continue to work that hard like we did today, things will flip for us,\u201d said Powell. \u201cWe took a massive step forward today and I thought our attitude was great. We just made a couple of errors which they punished and they put their foot on our throat and it did for us.\u201d Tries for Joel Monaghan and Denny Solomona ensured Castleford led 10-6 at half-time and they put themselves in a position to win after tries for Mike McMeeken and Jy Hitchcox cancelled out a Shannon McDonnell try to make it 20-12 in their favour. But as Castleford\u2019s injury-hit side began to tire, the Saints took advantage. Kyle Amor crashed over before Joe Greenwood scored his second of the afternoon and, although the Tigers fought late on, Lomax\u2019s well-executed finish rubber-stamped a win for St Helens that, in a heavily congested Super League table, may well turn out to be vital in the long run.

    "webTitle": "Minding\u2019s 1,000 Guineas superiority prompts talk of gatecrashing Derby", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One day after suffering terrible disappointment in the year\u2019s first Classic Aidan O\u2019Brien was back on history-making form with a 1-2-3 in the 1,000 Guineas. The race was thoroughly dominated by Minding, whose three-and-a-half-lengths success was so impressive as to prompt a certain amount of Derby chatter for the filly. That emanated from the bookmaking fraternity rather than from O\u2019Brien or Minding\u2019s owners at Coolmore. But in some eyes it will increase the credibility of the Derby talk that the first man to offer a quote, 5-2 \u201cwith a run\u201d, was Mike Dillon of Ladbrokes who has longstanding connections with the Coolmore partners. This was a big moment for O\u2019Brien, who was winning his 250th Group One race. Saddling the first three in a British Classic is not unprecedented but it has not been done in the modern era, not since Alec Taylor Jr in the 1918 St Leger, according to the Racing Post\u2019s John Randall, who is authoritative on such matters. As ever, when asked about those achievements, O\u2019Brien deflected the credit to his staff and his employers. For himself, he expressed mainly relief after Saturday\u2019s flop by Air Force Blue, a dismal 12th of 13 in the 2,000 Guineas. Laughing in the winner\u2019s enclosure here, the trainer said: \u201cListen, I suppose I couldn\u2019t destroy them all.\u201d Instinctively he seemed to expect that Minding would be aimed at the Irish 1,000 Guineas in three weeks\u2019 time on her way to the Oaks at Epsom 12 days later. \u201cObviously the lads will talk about that but all those things are open to her. I suppose they\u2019re going to talk about it and see what everyone wants to do.\u201d For anyone who would like to see her in the Derby, it is at least encouraging that O\u2019Brien did not recoil in horror when asked about the idea. Instead he pleaded for time, pointing to the large number of horses he will run in Derby trials over the coming fortnight, most notably US Army Ranger in Thursday\u2019s Chester Vase. \u201cListen, we\u2019ve plenty happening the next couple of weeks, so that\u2019ll sort it, tell us an awful lot.\u201d Running a filly in the Derby is not something O\u2019Brien would do lightly, given that he would much rather win the race with a colt. As one member of his entourage said here: \u201cEven if she can win the Derby, she can\u2019t be a stallion.\u201d But there is a suggestion that he wanted to run Found in last year\u2019s Epsom race, when his colts were not up to his usual standard, and that he now regrets not having done so. Found ended her year by beating the Derby winner at the Breeders\u2019 Cup. Another element to the decision is that O\u2019Brien has another strong Oaks candidate in Ballydoyle, the runner-up here after a bumping match with Midweek two furlongs out. While Minding is 11-10 for the Oaks, Ballydoyle is third in the betting on 8-1. Alice Springs, the third home behind Minding, is now likely to go for the French Guineas in a fortnight\u2019s time. Ryan Moore, who did the steering on Minding, was winning the 1,000 Guineas for the third time in five years. He was emphatic in his praise for the filly, saying: \u201cShe\u2019s out on her own, really. She\u2019s just faster than them and stays better than them. We were going very comfortably and had them all in trouble at halfway.\u201d Reflecting on Air Force Blue, O\u2019Brien said he had been worried that the horse could not stay this mile after showing so much speed in his work at home. It remains possible that he will get another chance at a mile in the Irish Guineas, but a step back in distance to sprint races seems a distinct possibility. O\u2019Brien will now change the colt\u2019s training regime, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve found out what doesn\u2019t work with him. Now we\u2019ve got to find out what works. It\u2019s always a dangerous time, coming from two-years-old to three and straight into a Classic without a run, because really you\u2019re in the dark.\u201d Such thoughts may also be in the mind of Mark Johnston, whose Lumiere was the disappointment of the 1,000 Guineas, dropping out to be last after setting the pace. Her jockey, William Buick, got a three-day suspension for failing to keep straight from the stalls and causing interference as he went straight to the stands\u2019 rail.",

      "body": "<p>One day after suffering terrible disappointment in the year\u2019s first Classic Aidan O\u2019Brien was back on history-making form with a 1-2-3 in the 1,000 Guineas. The race was thoroughly dominated by Minding, whose three-and-a-half-lengths success was so impressive as to prompt a certain amount of Derby chatter for the filly.</p> <p>That emanated from the bookmaking fraternity rather than from O\u2019Brien or Minding\u2019s owners at Coolmore. But in some eyes it will increase the credibility of the Derby talk that the first man to offer a quote, 5-2 \u201cwith a run\u201d, was Mike Dillon of Ladbrokes who has longstanding connections with the Coolmore partners.</p> <p>This was a big moment for O\u2019Brien, who was winning his 250th Group One race. Saddling the first three in a British Classic is not unprecedented but it has not been done in the modern era, not since Alec Taylor Jr in the 1918 St Leger, according to the Racing Post\u2019s John Randall, who is authoritative on such matters.</p> <p>As ever, when asked about those achievements, O\u2019Brien deflected the credit to his staff and his employers. For himself, he expressed mainly relief after Saturday\u2019s flop by Air Force Blue, a dismal 12th of 13 in the 2,000 Guineas. Laughing in the winner\u2019s enclosure here, the trainer said: \u201cListen, I suppose I couldn\u2019t destroy them all.\u201d</p> <p>Instinctively he seemed to expect that Minding would be aimed at the Irish 1,000 Guineas in three weeks\u2019 time on her way to the Oaks at Epsom 12 days later. \u201cObviously the lads will talk about that but all those things are open to her. I suppose they\u2019re going to talk about it and see what everyone wants to do.\u201d</p> <p>For anyone who would like to see her in the Derby, it is at least encouraging that O\u2019Brien did not recoil in horror when asked about the idea.

      "bodyText": "After this hard-fought draw, to stick with Louis van Gaal or twist for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho or AN Other remains the Manchester United hierarchy\u2019s quandary. If Ed Woodward and the executive vice-chairman\u2019s board have decided it is Champions League football or bust for Van Gaal then he now hinges on Arsenal taking only a point from their last two matches or Manchester City four points from theirs. In this context a point against Leicester City was a failure. Van Gaal\u2019s side have 60 points so edge past West Ham into fifth place but are four behind City and a further three from Arsenal. Since the 2-0 defeat at Stoke City on Boxing Day Woodward and his board have been in deliberation mode over whether to cull the Dutchman or allow him to keep on keeping on. Put bluntly, there is no wish to sack Van Gaal but the hierarchy may finally be forced into doing so. The unpalatable truth for the sizeable \u201cVan Gaal Out\u201d constituency is that United\u2019s troubled campaign is ending with signs of tangible life. A favoured mantra of the manager is that he agreed a three-year deal and this is precisely the time required to achieve success. The claim would have been better received if the Van Gaal rebuild in these opening two seasons had been marked by regular Hollywood football and a front-foot-first ethos, rather than the dour stuff fans cannot abide. This may now be occurring, though. And not in the \u201ctwo steps forward, two steps back\u201d manner that has plagued the campaign but as a permanent feature. Entering this game United had lost only once in the league since 6 March, won six of their last seven outings and last weekend reached the FA Cup final in a blaze of glory thanks to Anthony Martial\u2019s closing-moments clincher over Everton. The semi-final had United tearing at Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s side as in the Sir Alex Ferguson days of yore. Against a Leicester gunning to achieve sporting immortality United required only eight minutes to show this style once more, pause the Foxes dream and illustrate why Van Gaal is an enigma of a manager. The opener that stunned the visitors was a microcosm of the brightness and invention with which United started the contest. Antonio Valencia mugged the defence with a slick step-over before flipping over a cross and Martial\u2019s cool finish beat Kasper Schmeichel. This lead lasted only nine minutes before Wes Morgan headed past David de Gea, but in Martial, 19, Marcus Rashford, 18, and Jesse Lingard, 23, Van Gaal has an emerging front three whose pace and skill can burn through teams and who are only going to improve. Lingard and Rashford are home-reared talent and together with Martial made their debuts under Van Gaal. The trio plus the promise of other debutants this season Timothy Fosu-Mensah, 18, Cameron Borthwick-Jackson, 19, Guillermo Varela, 23, Donald Love, 21, Joe Riley, 19, and Regan Poole, 17, will be factored in by the executive when Van Gaal\u2019s future is decided. Not all of the above will make it, of course. But there is no denying here is a new wave of talent given a chance by the manager. If only Rashford was to become a bona fide first-team starter as a No9 then Van Gaal would have saved the club the thick end of \u00a340m. The 64-year-old may have happened upon Rashford, who was quiet on Sunday but showed flashes of class, by luck: he debuted against Midtjylland in February because of a Martial injury during the warm-up. But he took his opportunity and scored twice, and a question Woodward and colleagues will ask is whether a new man in charge would continue to give game time to the clutch of youngsters who Rashford heads. But as Mourinho waits for a call the defining question for Van Gaal remains whether United can finish above that perforated line that separates the elite four of the division from the rest. Before kick-off he said: \u201cWe have to win today, that is a big pressure. Leicester do not lose so much and we have to beat them. We want to qualify for the Champions League, we are strong at home and have proven that this season. All our matches are must-win, our rivals put pressure on us by winning yesterday.\u201d This was in reference to Arsenal\u2019s 1-0 victory over Norwich and West Ham\u2019s 3-0 win at West Bromwich Albion. Now Van Gaal must hope United can beat Norwich, West Ham and Bournemouth and other results ensure a top-four spot and, potentially, save his job.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For 60 years, the Italian brand Missoni has owned zigzags and stripes in fashion. The Missoni Art Colour show at the Fashion and Textile Museum in London does not disappoint on that front. Stripes are visible from the moment visitors walk through the door, on specially created lights that hang over the reception desk. The rest of the exhibition, which originally opened in the Maga museum in Gallarate, Italy, last year, takes a less obvious trip through the brand\u2019s history. As the title suggests, it\u2019s about the connections between the company\u2019s designs and modern and contemporary art. Divided into four galleries, the first contains no clothes at all. Instead, it features the dynamic paintings of the futurist Giacomo Balla and Orphist Sonia Delaunay as a way to show the influence of these colourists on the early designs of Missoni. Some of the paintings come from the family\u2019s art collection. Celia Joicey, the director of the Fashion and Textile Museum, says the family has \u201cart at the heart of everything they do. They have designed for over 60 years and always been honest and open about how they take inspiration from it\u201d. The clothes, of course, form a centrepiece \u2013 42 mannequins stand on a pyramid of stairs in the main room, displaying clothes designed by the brand from 1953 to 2014. The stripes and zigzags run riot: from a two-piece designed in 1966 that appeared on the cover of Grazia magazine to a purple cardigan and dress that won a prize at the US department store Neiman Marcus in 1973 and a pink coat worn by Vogue Italia\u2019s eccentric fashion editor Anna Piaggi in the noughties. Along with the high stripe and zig zag count, Joicey points out that the brand led the way with the body-conscious silhouette in fashion. \u201cThere\u2019s a sensuality from the clothes using the fine knits,\u201d she says. \u201cThat demonstrates how the body changed in fashion from the late 60s onwards.\u201d The early fashion shows amped this up: models wore no bras under diaphanous knitwear, causing a scandal in fashion. Fashion history students will also note the striped red, yellow and green dress. It was this design, part of the spring/summer 1969 collection, that brought Missoni to the attention of Diana Vreeland, the editor-in-chief of American Vogue. In an appointment with Rosita Missoni to introduce the brand, Vreeland reportedly zeroed in on the dress, commenting: \u201cWho said that there are only seven colours in the rainbow? There are tones!\u201d Vreeland\u2019s support meant the brand enjoyed popularity in the US, helping it expand beyond Europe. Missoni was set up by Ottavio Missoni with Rosita, his wife, in 1953. A former Olympic athlete, he started designing by making knitted tracksuits for the Olympic Games in 1948. They were worn by members of the Italian team. The brand launched properly five years later, combining Ottavio\u2019s flair for colour and pattern with Rosita\u2019s knowledge of textiles. Her family had owned a shawl-making factory, and her technical skills helped refine the technique that led to the fine knits the brand became known for. Today Missoni is huge, with interiors, hotels, childrenswear produced by the brand. Ottavio died in 2013, but it remains a family business. The couple\u2019s daughter Angela has designed the catwalk collection since 1997 and her brother Luca oversees the archive. Rosita Missoni, 84, still oversees the interior designs. The exhibition skims over the brand\u2019s history but it does pay tribute to Ottavio by displaying his art. Abstract paintings and huge wall hangings \u2013 arazzo in Italian \u2013 are displayed in the main room and upstairs among a collection of postwar Italian art. Sketches for fabric designs are shown alongside the brightly coloured minimalism by Dadamaino and stringed sculptures made by Bruno Munari. While these connections are a bit tangential, Missoni\u2019s sophisticated use of colour, as recognised by Vreeland, does mean they feel legitimate. Missoni Art Colour is on from 6 May to 4 September 2016.",

The <a href=\"http://www.ftmlondon.org/ftm-exhibitions/missoni-art-colour/\">Missoni Art Colour</a> show at the Fashion and Textile Museum in London does not disappoint on that front. Stripes are visible from the moment visitors walk through the door, on specially created lights that hang over the reception desk. <br /></p> <p>The rest of the exhibition, which originally opened in the Maga museum in Gallarate, Italy, last year, takes a less obvious trip through the brand\u2019s history. As the title suggests, it\u2019s about the connections between the company\u2019s designs and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/shortcuts/2015/oct/27/modern-art-is-rubbish-why-mistaking-artworks-for-trash-proves-their-worth\">modern and contemporary art</a>. Divided into four galleries, the first contains no clothes at all. </p> <p>Instead, it features the dynamic paintings of the futurist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jun/16/futurism-tate-modern\">Giacomo Balla</a> and Orphist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/apr/13/sonia-delaunay-tate-modern-london-review\">Sonia Delaunay</a> as a way to show the influence of these colourists on the early designs of Missoni. Some of the paintings come from the family\u2019s art collection. Celia Joicey, the director of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/nov/26/museums.schools\">the Fashion and Textile Museum</a>, says the family has \u201cart at the heart of everything they do.

      "bodyText": "From an unpromising beginning the Yorkshire bowlers came back strongly to take the honours on the first day here at Trent Bridge. With Andrew Gale having taken the option to field first, the Nottinghamshire openers, Alex Hales and Steve Mullaney, the one tall and rangy, the other compact and chunky, threatened to overwhelm them with a blistering opening stand of 77 in the first 15 overs as the seamers, Jack Brooks in particular, used up a week\u2019s worth of half-volleys in an hour. If they started to claw back some control with three wickets before lunch, it owed more to Nottinghamshire benevolence than their own industry: the session brought them more than they deserved. The afternoon was a different matter. Although this is a pitch on which it is better to err on the full side rather than drop short (Mullaney\u2019s two disdainfully pulled sixes off David Willey and Liam Plunkett were testament to that) it surely would not have been necessary to tell the bowlers to bring their length back a fraction. But Jason Gillespie would nonetheless have read them their fortune in the interval and certainly it was a different attack during the afternoon, particularly in the case of Brooks. Where he had been sliding on to the bat nicely in his first two spells, he began to hit the deck hard and, having conceded 20 in his first two overs, was eventually rewarded with figures of four for 74. This was in addition to taking a well-judged skier at deep square-leg and helping to run out the last man, Stuart Broad, with an accurate throw to the keeper from long-leg. It was an excellent comeback. There were three wickets for Adil Rashid, too, whose googly is becoming his most potent weapon in all forms of the game. Under the circumstances, and particularly given the start, Nottinghamshire will feel aggrieved that they could make no more than 261 and the two batting points it brought. Each of Hales (36), Mullaney (78) and Michael Lumb (49) got themselves established on what essentially seemed a good pitch, offering a little to the diligent seamers but not excessively so. The dismissal of Mullaney with what proved the last ball of the morning was key to the afternoon success, the perfect length ball from Steven Patterson finding the outside edge with a relieved Alex Lees taking the catch at first slip at the second attempt. At all but a run a ball Mullaney had hit 12 fours and those two sixes. Bad light prevented a start to the Yorkshire reply. Much of the early attention was directed at Hales, in his first match since opting to take a break after the World T20. The fullness of time will show the wisdom of that but, with his place in the England team no stronger than a tenuous, it was a risky strategy and he certainly needs a couple of convincing innings now. Instead, though, he played a typical Hales-ish knock in which he brutalised the bad ball but then managed to get himself out rather than be got out. In this instance it was to the first ball of Brooks\u2019s second spell. So much had he overpitched that it called to mind the occasion when Tom Cartwright, being uncharacteristically driven, asked for the pitch to be measured, whereupon it was found to be a yard short. Brooks had no such excuse. But Gale had placed Joe Root at short extra cover on the drive and, although Brooks overpitched again, Hales drove it hard and low straight to Root who took the catch easily. Of Hales it rather told those watching little they did not already know.",

    "webTitle": "Aerial photos of the Somme inspire poet Simon Armitage", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Century-old images of a landscape already layered with millennia of history, which became the setting for the slaughter of more than 20,000 men in one day, have captured the imagination of the poet Simon Armitage. His new poems, matched with images from the battle of the Somme printed from the fragile glass negatives now in the collection of the Imperial War Museum, will be exhibited for the first time as part of the Norfolk and Norwich festival in May. It was the deceptive beauty and apparent tranquility of the historic landscape, captured on reconaissance missions by members of the Royal Flying Corps using a camera strapped to the side of a two-seater plane, which gripped Armitage. He said the photographs offered an unfamiliar visual perspective of the conflict, seen not from the trenches but from the sky: \u201cMap-like images of cratered fields and hieroglyphic trench patters; dreamlike \u2018obliques\u2019 showing landscapes of sepia-toned towns and ghostly villages; panoramas of apparently tranquil meadows and country lanes that disguise more macabre details.\u201d These photographs will form a physical and atmospheric backdrop to poems that explore events and locations significant to the Somme offensive. The result will be a dialogue between military documents of the day and the poetic responses they provoke a hundred years later. An extract from Still, a new poem by Simon Armitage: A time will certainly come in these rich vales When a ploughman slicing open the soil Will crunch through rusting spears, or strike A headless iron helmet with his spade, Or stare, wordless, at the harvest of raw bones He exhumes from the earth\u2019s unmarked grave. Alan Wakefield, a historian specialising in first world war photography at the IWM, said the flyers boasted they could have the images processed, printed, and couriered by motorcycle despatch to a desk at the War Office, within half an hour of the plane landing. \u201cThey prided themselves in the quality of the photographs, but it was in their interest to get it right the first time \u2013 otherwise they would have to go right back and do it again,\u201d he said. Wakefield has 120,000 glass negatives in his care, the largest such collection in the world. By 1916 the photographers could load a cartridge with several glass plates into the camera, but would then have to replace them repeatedly mid-air. The camera man was also responsible for looking out for German fighter pilots or anti-aircraft fire, and controlled the only gun on board. Since the images were obtained by a pilot flying slowly, in a straight line and at a constant level, straight towards or over the German lines, many paid with their lives for the information they were trying to record. The kite balloon observers were in an even more perilous situation, sent up to 915 metres (3,000 ft) in basket under a gas balloon, tethered to a winch truck far below. They were the only troops equipped with parachutes: if their balloon was hit, and and it was going to take too long to winch it down, they were supposed to jump over the side. \u201cThe trouble was they were only sent up in still weather, so they were jumping with a blazing balloon falling straight down on top of them,\u201d said Wakefield. \u201cThis is what flying was really about in the first world war \u2013 people remember the air aces and the dog fights, but they were really only operating in support of the observers.\u201d Armitage came into the IWM photographic store, to pore through the archive with Wakefield and choose the images. The line of the Roman road between Albert and Bapaume became the route of one of the most infamous killing grounds of the war. One pair of photographs shows Pozi\u00e8res on 17 June 1916, a village occupied by the Germans but still a place of old stone houses, barns, little fields, gardens, country lanes, and a small square where people would once have gathered under the trees. A month later, on 16 July, after it has been taken following ferocious British artillery fire, the camera recorded that the village had almost been blasted from the face of the earth. Armitage\u2019s poems will be engraved on glass, to evoke the original negatives. The exhibition Fierce Light \u2013 which will also feature poems from Paul Muldoon, Jo Shapcott and Jackie Kay, along with new short films reflecting on the battle and its legacy \u2013 is part of the 14-18 NOW arts commissions marking the century. Its world premiere will be at the East Gallery of Norwich University of the Arts on 10 May, and the exhibition will run until 4 June. The poets will read from their work at an event at the Norwich Playhouse on 13 May. Still and other Simon Armitage poems are published by Enitharmon press in association with Imperial War Museums.",

      "body": "<p>Century-old images of a landscape already layered with millennia of history, which became the setting for the slaughter of more than 20,000 men in one day, have captured the imagination of the poet Simon Armitage.</p> <p>His new poems, matched with images from the battle of the Somme printed from the fragile glass negatives now in the collection of the Imperial War Museum, will be exhibited for the first time as part of the <a href=\"http://www.nnfestival.org.uk/festival/all-events/fierce-light-exhibition\">Norfolk and Norwich festival</a> in May.</p> <p>It was the deceptive beauty and apparent tranquility of the historic landscape, captured on reconaissance missions by members of the Royal Flying Corps using a camera strapped to the side of a two-seater plane, which gripped Armitage.</p> <p> He said the photographs offered an unfamiliar visual perspective of the conflict, seen not from the trenches but from the sky: \u201cMap-like images of cratered fields and hieroglyphic trench patters; dreamlike \u2018obliques\u2019 showing landscapes of sepia-toned towns and ghostly villages; panoramas of apparently tranquil meadows and country lanes that disguise more macabre details.\u201d </p> <p>These photographs will form a physical and atmospheric backdrop to poems that explore events and locations significant to the Somme offensive. The result will be a dialogue between military documents of the day and the poetic responses they provoke a hundred years later.</p> <h2>An extract from Still, a new poem by Simon Armitage:</h2> <blockquote> <p>A time will certainly come in these rich vales</p> <p>When a ploughman slicing open the soil</p> <p>Will crunch through rusting spears, or strike</p> <p>A headless iron helmet with his spade,</p> <p>Or stare, wordless, at the harvest of raw bones</p> <p>He exhumes from the earth\u2019s unmarked grave.</p> </blockquote> <p>Alan Wakefield, a historian specialising in first world war photography at the <a href=\"http://www.iwm.org.uk/\">IWM</a>, said the flyers boasted they could have the images processed, printed, and couriered by motorcycle despatch to a desk at the War Office, within half an hour of the plane landing.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThey prided themselves in the quality of the photographs, but it was in their interest to get it right the first time \u2013 otherwise they would have to go right back and do it again,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Wakefield has 120,000 glass negatives in his care, the largest such collection in the world. By 1916 the photographers could load a cartridge with several glass plates into the camera, but would then have to replace them repeatedly mid-air. The camera man was also responsible for looking out for German fighter pilots or anti-aircraft fire, and controlled the only gun on board. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f99ac55ead0fe8fc0820f9cedf8c067b7eabf6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f99ac55ead0fe8fc0820f9cedf8c067b7eabf6d/0_116_5379_3229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial photograph of the village of Pozi\u00e8res on 16 July 1916, after destruction by British artillery fire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aerial photograph of the village of Pozi\u00e8res on 16 July 1916, after destruction by British artillery fire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imperial War Museums</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the images were obtained by a pilot flying slowly, in a straight line and at a constant level, straight towards or over the German lines, many paid with their lives for the information they were trying to record. The kite balloon observers were in an even more perilous situation, sent up to 915 metres (3,000 ft) in basket under a gas balloon, tethered to a winch truck far below. They were the only troops equipped with parachutes: if their balloon was hit, and and it was going to take too long to winch it down, they were supposed to jump over the side.</p> <p>\u201cThe trouble was they were only sent up in still weather, so they were jumping with a blazing balloon falling straight down on top of them,\u201d said Wakefield.</p> <p>\u201cThis is what flying was really about in the first world war \u2013 people remember the air aces and the dog fights, but they were really only operating in support of the observers.\u201d</p> <p>Armitage came into the IWM photographic store, to pore through the archive with Wakefield and choose the images.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a509223d032a0dc815c05bdccbee4f50473e305\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a509223d032a0dc815c05bdccbee4f50473e305/0_448_5209_3125/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial photograph of the Albert to Bapaume road, taken 16 October 1916.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aerial photograph of the Albert to Bapaume road, taken 16 October 1916.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imperial War Museums</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The line of the Roman road between Albert and Bapaume became the route of one of the most infamous killing grounds of the war. One pair of photographs shows Pozi\u00e8res on 17 June 1916, a village occupied by the Germans but still a place of old stone houses, barns, little fields, gardens, country lanes, and a small square where people would once have gathered under the trees. A month later, on 16 July, after it has been taken following ferocious British artillery fire, the camera recorded that the village had almost been blasted from the face of the earth. </p> <p>Armitage\u2019s poems will be engraved on glass, to evoke the original negatives.</p> <p>The exhibition <a href=\"http://www.nnfestival.org.uk/festival/early_shows/fierce-light\">Fierce Light</a> \u2013 which will also feature poems from Paul Muldoon, Jo Shapcott and Jackie Kay, along with new short films reflecting on the battle and its legacy \u2013 is part of the 14-18 NOW arts commissions marking the century. Its world premiere will be at the East Gallery of Norwich University of the Arts on 10 May, and the exhibition will run until 4 June.

      "bodyText": "A newborn baby is among 99 people believed to have drowned in two separate shipwrecks off the Libyan coast this weekend, according to survivors who arrived in Italy. Twenty-six survivors were rescued by a commercial vessel after a rubber dinghy in which they were travelling sank in the Mediterranean on Friday, a few hours after departing from Sabratha in Libya. They were transferred to Italian coastguard ships before being brought ashore in Lampedusa, Italy\u2019s southernmost island, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The baby was among 84 people still missing on Saturday.. \u201cThe dinghy was taking on water, in very bad conditions. Many people had already fallen in the sea and drowned,\u201d said Flavio Di Giacomo, IOM spokesman in Italy. \u201cThey are all very shocked,\u201d Di Giacomo said, adding they would receive psychological support in Lampedusa. The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said that after taking on water the boat broke into two pieces and 26 people were saved from the sea. Survivors from a second shipwreck arrived in the Sicilian port of Pozzallo on Sunday, after an accident during a search-and-rescue operation the day before. Two bodies were recovered and brought ashore along with eight of about 105 people saved, who were taken to hospital in serious condition. The shipwrecks are the latest incidents in which hundreds of people have lost their lives in the Mediterranean. Last week, up to 500 people were feared dead after a shipping boat hoping to reach Italy from eastern Libya sank. Forty-one survivors told UNHCR that smugglers had taken them out to sea and tried to move them to a larger, overcrowded boat that then capsized. So far this year, at least 1,360 people have been reported dead or missing after trying to cross the Mediterranean, including the latest two shipwrecks, while more than 182,800 have reached European shores. Whereas previous years have seen Syrians and Eritreans arriving in large numbers from Libya, most of those reaching Italy this year have been from African nations. In Greece, Syrians have made up nearly half of arrivals, followed by Afghans and Iraqis. Although the majority of people have arrived in Greece in recent months, a controversial EU-Turkey deal to stop refugees and migrants crossing the Aegean Sea has prompted speculation that people could arrive in Italy in greater numbers. However, there is yet to be a significant change in numbers crossing from Libya compared with last year \u2013 just over 27,000 people have reached Italy during 2016.",

      "bodyText": "Not the best preparation for Real Madrid, nor the best message to Manchester United. This was as comfortable a match for Southampton as it was a wretched one for Manchester City, depleted and disconnected while Sadio Man\u00e9 tore them to shreds. Man\u00e9\u2019s hat-trick capped a rampant display from Saints and, while Manuel Pellegrini can rightly argue about being hung out to dry by the Premier League schedule, this result will hardly immerse his squad in confidence before a daunting European semi-final in the Spanish capital on Wednesday. \u201cAre you watching, Real Madrid?\u201d chanted the City fans ironically once Man\u00e9 had completed his hat-trick, with Shane Long having given Southampton the lead and Dusan Tadic orchestrating things beautifully in midfield. Kelechi Iheanacho was the only City player to emerge with any pride, scoring one goal before half-time and a stunning late consolation. The result meant City finished the day four points above Manchester United, having played a game more, and with their rivals having three matches left to play after their earlier draw against Leicester. Louis van Gaal had conceded some ground in the battle for a top-four place after his side\u2019s match, but this performance means the race is not quite over yet. For City, only three players who started here also did in the midweek first leg against Real Madrid, which ended goalless. Joe Hart, Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi and Fernandinho remained, and this unrecognisable side were sliced through with ease on numerous occasions. There were too often gaping spaces for Southampton to exploit in wide areas, with Pablo Zabaleta and \u2013 in particular \u2013 Aleksandar Kolarov regularly abandoning their defensive duties. Tadic caused major problems yet it was Man\u00e9 who walked away with the match ball. It was his second Premier League hat-trick \u2013 his first being the quickest in history, last season \u2013 and it propelled Ronald Koeman\u2019s side above Liverpool into seventh. Of Man\u00e9, the Southampton manager said: \u201cHe is still a young player and sometimes they need to be more consistent and that is why we train and work with all the players. A bit unpredictable but he was focused and clinical. That was one of my critics to all the strikers but we are very productive at home with more chances to score more. \u201cYou can talk about the changes of Manchester City but that is not fair. Give all the credit to Southampton because the performance was fantastic. \u201cFrom the start we caused them a lot of problems with the movement of Sadio and Shane [Long]. Dusan and [Steven] Davis were fantastic.\u201d Fraser Forster had palmed away a Raheem Sterling shot after Iheanacho had outmanoeuvred Virgil van Dijk on the touchline but Southampton were into their stride early on and within eight minutes of that chance for Sterling, City were two down and blue shirts in defence wore vacant stares. The Saints right-back, Cuco Martina, lofted a ball through for Tadic in the 25th minute and, with the Serb flying at pace, he deftly lifted it across goal with a single touch of the left foot and Long prodded past Hart. Seconds later City were cut apart again. Once more the opportunity arose from a lack of cohesion down City\u2019s left, Victor Wanyama breaking up play in midfield and feeding Tadic, who advanced and slipped a precise ball between Kolarov and Eliaquim Mangala to Man\u00e9, who emphatically finished past Hart. Iheanacho clawed City back into the match before half-time and the 19-year-old was the only City player injecting a sense of urgency into their play. In the 44th minute he fed Samir Nasri out wide right and headed the resulting ball in past Forster following a ricochet off Martina at the far post. Pellegrini was impressed by Iheanacho but admitted it was unlikely the youngster would force his way into the side for the Real game. \u201cWe start thinking tomorrow about what will be the starting XI for Wednesday,\u201d said the City manager. \u201cKelechi today scored two goals and is doing well in all the games but for the moment I am not thinking about that.\u201d In the 57th minute Southampton had a third. Davis whipped in a corner and, although Van Dijk\u2019s header was tipped excellently on to the bar by Hart, the rebound hit the turf and fell to Man\u00e9 at the far post who swept home. The Senegalese attacker completed his hat-trick in the 68th minute. Van Dijk outmuscled Iheanacho in midfield and Tadic fed Man\u00e9 on the counterattack, with the finish once again assured. There was still time for a pearler from Iheanacho on the edge of the Southampton penalty area, but as the home fans sang: \u201cGareth Bale, he\u2019s coming for you,\u201d Manchester City\u2019s heads dropped and hope faded.

Once more the opportunity arose from a lack of cohesion down City\u2019s left, Victor Wanyama breaking up play in midfield and feeding Tadic, who advanced and slipped a precise ball between Kolarov and Eliaquim Mangala to Man\u00e9, who emphatically finished past Hart.</p> <p>Iheanacho clawed City back into the match before half-time and the 19-year-old was the only City player injecting a sense of urgency into their play. In the 44th minute he fed Samir Nasri out wide right and headed the resulting ball in past Forster following a ricochet off Martina at the far post.</p> <p>Pellegrini was impressed by Iheanacho but admitted it was unlikely the youngster would force his way into the side for the Real game. \u201cWe start thinking tomorrow about what will be the starting XI for Wednesday,\u201d said the City manager. \u201cKelechi today scored two goals and is doing well in all the games but for the moment I am not thinking about that.\u201d</p> <p>In the 57th minute Southampton had a third. Davis whipped in a corner and, although Van Dijk\u2019s header was tipped excellently on to the bar by Hart, the rebound hit the turf and fell to Man\u00e9 at the far post who swept home.</p> <p>The Senegalese attacker completed his hat-trick in the 68th minute. Van Dijk outmuscled Iheanacho in midfield and Tadic fed Man\u00e9 on the counterattack, with the finish once again assured.</p> <p>There was still time for a pearler from Iheanacho on the edge of the Southampton penalty area, but as the home fans sang: \u201cGareth Bale, he\u2019s coming for you,\u201d Manchester City\u2019s heads dropped and hope faded.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Sadio Man\u00e9 (Southampton)</p>",

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s James Riach\u2019s match report from St Mary\u2019s: Another excellent performance from Southampton, who out-fought, out-thought and out-played City. In particular, Sadio Mane took his goals very well, two considered finishes and one instinctive one - if he can find some consistency, he could be a serious player because he\u2019s a handful even on a bad day. City, on the other hand, were weak and slow. If they don\u2019t beat Arsenal next week and Manchester United win all their games - a stretch, granted - they won\u2019t finish in the top four. Otherwise, thanks all for your comments and company - bye. 90+2 min In commentary, Alan Parry and Niall Quinn were discussing the mental effect of this defeat on City - of which I\u2019m dubious. If you can\u2019t get intense for a semi-final second leg in the Bernabeu, then you can\u2019t get intense, and Joe Hart\u2019s sense of self won\u2019t suffer simply because of a bad afternoon that wasn\u2019t his fault. 90 min There will be a minimum of four added minutes. 89 min Southampton continue to probe. Though Mane and their attackers will get most of the accolades, Virgil van Dijk has been superb today. 88 min Tadic, who\u2019s had a superb afternoon, gives way to Rodriguez. 86 min Martina is fractionally late on Sterling, so Nasri shoves him - presumably in protest at the unfairness of the system. The ref tells both that they\u2019re naughty boys, and they escape without a card. 85 min City have located some urgency and conviction, but a Southampton goal still looks as likely as another for them. 83 min Iheanacho finds Sterling to his left and he screeches into the box. The return is on, and Bony is on-hand too, but Sterling goes for the shot, which is well blocked by Fonte. 81 min Southampton could be forgiven for sitting back and seeing it out, but they\u2019re after more - again, Long frees Mane, and his low cross whistles across the face of goal. Iheanacho is the only City player who\u2019s done anything today, and what a finish this is! He takes a cut-back off Nasri on the edge of the box, looks up, and bends a left footer over Forster and high into the net towards the far post. He\u2019s a player. 77 min This game is, I\u2019d say, doner than Ronnie and Samthana. 75 min Jesus Navas\u2019s grandad. 73 min Davis, who\u2019s had a fine afternoon, is replaced by Ward-Prowse. 70 min City are in mither here - if they\u2019re not careful, this is going to become a seriously severe kicking. Mane, Mane, Mane! Virgil slams into a slide tackle, reaching the ball ahead of Iheanacho and finding Long on halfway. He sets Mane away at inside-right, and though he\u2019s forced a little wider than ideal, he keeps the heid and slots home at the near post as Otamendi slides in. Can\u2019t believe it\u2019s taken him 40 whole minutes to complete that hat-trick, the indolent idler. 66 min Southampton win another left-wing corner, headed up by Bony at the near post. Whereupon Van Dijk flips an overhead kick at goal, forcing Hart to palm over with some consternation. And he\u2019s there again when the next cross arrives, only this time the ball\u2019s punched clear. 65 min Guardian sources tell me that Southampton have no song about Sadio Mane to this. What a world. 64 min Fabian Delph, who was playing, apparently, is replaced by Jesus Navas. 62 min Still no Aguero. We can probably deduce what Manuel Pellegrini reckons to this game. 60 min \u201cPhilosophy FC would need to be managed by the cultured deep-thinking Stoke City gaffer, Marcuse,\u201d, tweets Jamie Woods, quite brilliantly. Is Herbert a preferable name to Leslie? 59 min Clasie is replaced by Romeu. He\u2019s played well. That = that. Southampton win a corner on the left, whipped in towards Virgil at the near post. He clunks a header onto Hart\u2019s head and then, courtesy of some fantastic shampoo, the bar. The ferocity of the bounce down takes it away from Kolarov and Fonte, but Mane is there sharplish, hooking a pelvis high ball into the net from close range. 55 min City free Zabaleta, galloping down the right, and Tadic pulls him back. He\u2019s booked, and somehow considers this to be unfair. 54 min Long holds the ball up on halfway, enticing Eliaquim \u201cMrs\u201d Mangala into a foul. That\u2019s just what Southampton needed, and very simple behaviour indeed. 50 min Long spell of possession from City, working the ball across the width of the pitch as Southampton sit in - but they can\u2019t work any space, and eventually do well to stop Mane breaking when they give it away. 50 min Superb from Iheanacho, who plays a one-two with Bony then wriggles by Clasie before shooting instead of hitting a return. This does not find favour with his partner - Forster saves comfortably - but that\u2019s better from City. 48 min On the topic of philosophers, we\u2019ve had a few imaginatively suggest Socrates, as well as Kant(e) and Ashlety Jung. 47 min \u201cShane Long is a lot like Vardy except he\u2019s been less lucky and he\u2019s been a good premiership striker for 6 years not 6 months\u201d, tweets Dan Friedman. Not sure about that - Vardy has done brilliantly, that isn\u2019t luck. And Long has never been as devastating as he has this season. 46 min Off we go again. Naturally, Graeme Souness advocates the starting of arguments in the changing room - \u201cproper pros\u201d like Zabaleta and Joe Hart. While we wait, email from Gary Hickman: \u201cYour question on philosophers and football reminds me of the monty python sketch Germany vs Greece...\u201d \u201cNeither Dante nor Virgil was a philosopher,\u201d tweets Stuart Walton. \u201cThey were poets\u201d. Yes they were, but they wrote about ideas as well as images. Half-time viewing: That was an excellent half from Southampton. While it\u2019s true that City weren\u2019t really at it, that only became the case once they realised quite how hard they\u2019d be forced to work. In particular, Clasie and Davis have been tenacious in midfield, while Mane\u2019s direct running and intelligent movement has been way too much for, er, Otamendi and Mangala. But this is still a game - you\u2019d back City to score at least once more, especially if they risk Aguero. ... 45+2 min \u201cI find myself distracted by the thought of Southampton purchasing Dante just so he can appear alongside Virgil,\u201d ponders Ian Copestake. The only context in which philosophy can be used in connection with a football team. Who else would be in? 45 min There shall be two added minutes. Iheanacho has the knack. First, he holds the ball up well to find Nasri and then, when the low cross pops up off Fonte, he adjusts to force his neck into a header of sufficient power to pull a goal back. 43 min Manuel Pellegrini is in a similar position to the one in which Jurgen Klopp found himself earlier today. Does he accept the loss, or bring on some firepower and ballast at half-time? 41 min \u201cA friend commented that Pellegrini doesn\u2019t look too worried about City missing Champions league football next year,\u201d reckons Ezra Cohen\u2019s friend, and it\u2019d be hard to blame him. I wonder if there are any break clauses in Guardiola\u2019s contract - though chances are City will be fine. 40 min \u201cI\u2019m pleased for Shane Long, he seems to be one of he most underrated players in the Premiership,\u201d emails Mark Judd. \u201cAlways appears to work his socks off too.\u201d Yes, I\u2019d agree with that - his bite is giving City real gyp, especially as Mane and Tadic are having good days too. 38 min Gosh, City are severely lacking in fibre and vertebrae; this time it\u2019s Kolarov, selling Hart short with a backpass - he hares out to slam clear. And then again, Nasri dwells on the ball, is mugged by Davis and Clasie, and Southampton sweep forward to earn another corner; it comes to nowt. 36 min With City\u2019s defenders expecting a cross, Martina slots another ball between left-back and centre-back for Mane. With City\u2019s defenders expecting a cross, he cuts back for Clasie, but just behind him, forcing a chip that drops only just over the bar. 35 min \u201cMan City are making Joe Hart look less and less elite by the minute,\u201d snarks Ian Copestake, but I\u2019m not so sure about that. He\u2019s been left high and dry by his defenders for both goals - though you could argue it\u2019s his job to organise them. 34 min Mangala and Otamendi appear absolutely flummoxed by the movement of Mane and Long. 34 min Southampton are all over City now, Long snapping a square ball just behind the rampaging Davis. 32 min Imagining City mustering the stones to come back into this is not at all easy. Another very nice goal, this. A City attack breaks down on the edge of the Soutampton box and Wanyama sets Tadic away with a long ball out to the right. With the defenders expecting a cross, instead he slides a ball behind Mangala for Mane, forcing Hart to come out; the finish, lifted over him, is expert. 28 min If Otamendi thought as hard about his football as he does about his appearance, he\u2019d be a much better player. 27 min Fernandinho, City\u2019s best player against Madrid, has been absolutely abject so far today. What\u2019s red and white and Long all over? This goal, that\u2019s what. Martina larrups a swinging ball into space for Tadic, pacing down the right. His cross is midriff height, and Otamendi reckons he can just shepherd it back to Hart; as if. Long sneaks up on him, pokes home, and that\u2019s very well done indeed. 23 min Mane robs Fernandinho in centrefield and finds Davis, who sets Tadic away. His cross is low and Otamendi has no idea that Mane is behind him, leaving the ball to Hart who is only just able to collect. 21 min Fernandinho is booked for a foul on Davis. 20 min Fantastic save Forster! Iheanacho draws Van Dijk out to the left touchline and skates past, showing serious composure to hang onto possession until the perfect cut-back to Sterling presents itself. His man\u2019s shot isn\u2019t bad either, though it ought to have been better - from close range, Forster manages to shoulder the ball away. 19 min Long sees the ball in the air in centrefield and sets off into the space behind Mangala. Clasie finds him too, and he slaps a low right-footer first time into the near-post side-netting. 17 min Lovely from Southampton Bertrand allowing a ball across his body out on the touchline to guide a first-timer into the path of Tadic. With men charging towards the box, he whipped a low first-time cross towards long, forcing Otamendi to slide behind. The corner came to nothing, but Southampton are coming. 15 min Almost lovely from Southampton, Mane sweeping a first time ball over the defence for Long. But it was slightly too long, allowing Zabaleta to turn it away from him, only to shilly-shally and be robbed. Only for Long to dilly-dally and be robbed in return. 13 min A little flurry of City resulting in a left-wing corner that Kolarov thunks beyond everyone. But his team are improving. 11 min Mane intercepts a poor pass from Fernandinho and heads towards the box, cutting across the pitch from right to left. By the time he gets to a central position he had a man on either side, slippable in, but instead scuffs a shot that\u2019s easily fielded by Hart. 10 min City have had plenty of possession so far, but not created anything, and then Delph loses it to Mane on halfway. He\u2019s all ready to streak away and thump a long-ranger into the top corner, but instead a heavy touch means he\u2019s unloaded justfour yards from where it all began. 8 min Nasri does well coming inside and feeds Zabaleta, who looks for Iheanacho. He\u2019s hustled over the by-line by Fonte, and displeased when the ref awards a goalkick. 6 min Players from both sides are slipping about. 5 min Today is Joe Hart\u2019s 300th Premier League appearance, and, despite how snickerable his persona can be, he is one of only four elite players currently in England. The others, for my money, are Lloris, De Gea and Aguero. 3 min Big afternoon for Raheem Sterling, this - a good game, and he might well get Silva\u2019s spot for the Bernabeu. And he\u2019s loitering at the back post when Zabaleta crosses from the right, but Fonte gets in between him and it and the ball flies past both. 2 min More pressure from Southampton, Martina cutting back for Mane whose low shot was too close to Hart. 1 min Tadic rinses Zabaleta on the outside and slings over a cross that\u2019s scrambled away. 1 min Southampton get us underway. The players are in the tunnel, City intimidatingly clad in baby blue tracksyoot tops. Ronald Koeman hopes City are distracted by their European commitments; Manuel Pellegrini needs a haircut, severely. Tangentially, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how Samir Nasri plays today. City haven\u2019t been the same without him, and his ability to retain possession and pass perceptively would be invaluable in the Bernabeu - were he in their European squad. Of course, also missing this afternoon is David Silva - he\u2019ll not be involved for a few weeks after hurting himself against Madrid in midweek. When football was football, etc, etcetera, ad nauseum and so on. So, Southampton make three changes from their last game - Martina, Mane and Clasie come in - while City leave Sagna, Clichy, Fernando, Navas and Aguero on the bench, with Kompany and De Bruyne not in the squad. And rightly so, I\u2019d say - though they\u2019d not have known in advance, Manchester United\u2019s draw means that they\u2019ve margin for error in the league. Southampton (4-3-3): Forster; Martina, Van Dijk, Fonte, Bertrand; Clasie, Davis, Wanyama; Mane, Long, Tadic. Subs: Stekelenburg, Yoshida, Rodriguez, Cedrid, Romeu, Ward-Prowse, Austin. Manchester City (4-4-2): Hart; Zabaleta, Otamendi, Mangala, Kolarov; Nasri, Delph, Fernandinho, Sterling; Iheanacho, Bony. Subs: Caballero, Sagna, Clichy, Demichelis, Fernando, Navas, Aguero. Bloke doing his best: Andre Marriner. Sometimes, a fixture just looks attractive, and this one is of that ilk. Southampton are decent side in any case, but also in decent form; City are the same, and under pressure. Their spot in next season\u2019s Champions League is not yet secure, and with a visit from Arsenal still to come, they may well need something at St Mary\u2019s. Not easy at the best of times, and these are not those - well, they are, but they\u2019re also not. On the one hand, after this City travel to Madrid for a Champions League semi-final; on the other hand, after this City travel to Madrid for a European Cup semi-final. So, they can hardly compromise this season\u2019s Champions League prospects to guarantee next season\u2019s, but at the same time, Pep Guardiola will have a stronger squad and isn\u2019t turning up to play Europa League; I wonder where Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s priorities lie.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A freight train derailed close to Washington DC early Sunday and is leaking hazardous material and causing disruption in the area of the capital. More than 10 cars are understood to have left the tracks, a small portion of the long, 175-car southbound train. No injuries have been reported. At least three cars are leaking a hazardous substance, according to Doug Buchanan, a spokesman for the District of Columbia fire department. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a news conference that the leak was contained, but officials were not sure how much had leaked. \u201cThe fumes should not cause you any problems and you should not be able to smell them anywhere else,\u201d said DC Fire and EMS Deputy Chief John Donnelly. It was not immediately clear what caused the derailment. Crews were inspecting the tracks, which are used by CSX, Metro and Amtrak, and were working to restore service. Photos tweeted by DC Fire and Emergency after the derailment showed cars in a zigzag line across the tracks. Chris Nellum said he lives nearby and his window looks directly over the tracks. The train derailed near the Rhode Island Avenue metro station shortly before 7am local time and the nearby avenue was closed to road traffic. A witness told local radio station WTOP that he heard \u201cthis fantastic noise\u201d outside his home on Sunday morning and rushed to the window, from where he could see the railroad tracks. \u201cI thought it was an airplane too close to the building. Then I looked out and I said, \u2018Wow, the train turned over,\u2019\u201d said the local resident. Buchanan said there were no evacuations of residents. \u201cIt looks like our guys have got this pretty well contained. Two, possibly three, of the derailed cars are leaking hazardous material. Exactly what that is and the extent of the leak remains unclear,\u201d he said. At least one of the chemicals leaking from the damaged train is understood to be sodium hydroxide, according to the local NBC TV station, citing multiple sources at the scene. Also known as lye and caustic soda, the odorless chemical may generate substantial heat when dissolved in water, which may be sufficient to ignite combustible materials, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The CDC said it could cause eye and skin irritation and burns when exposed. It is also damaging to the respiratory system if the fumes are inhaled. Pictures posted on the fire department\u2019s Twitter account showed several cars lying on their sides by the tracks on the main train route into the city, including tank cars, bulk material cars and box cars. Authorities have not issued official instructions to local residents, but one near the scene told a local television station that he had been instructed to stay inside by firefighters. Resident Chris Nellum said he lived nearby and his window looked directly over the tracks. \u201cI thought it was like a semi-truck coming toward the building, and when I looked out the window, I saw cars piling up,\u201d said Nellum, who had just moved in the night before. \u201cSo I\u2019m not even used to hearing trains. It was jarring.\u201d Nellum said his girlfriend tried to leave the area and was told to stay put, but she eventually found a way out. \u201cShe\u2019s an environmentalist, so she is very concerned about whatever is leaking,\u201d he said. The CSX train is owned by CSX Transportation, the international freight company based in Jacksonville, Florida. The company put out a statement later on Sunday morning to say that the service was heading towards Hamlet, North Carolina, from Cumberland, Maryland, when the derailment happened. The train was just under half empty, with 94 of the 175 cars loaded with freight. A portion of the Washington DC metro service on the Red line has been suspended in the area with bus shuttles acting as a replacement for passenger train services. An underground gas line was also ruptured during the derailment and gas supplies have been turned off in the area, although it is unclear how many people are affected by the closure, according to the local NBC station.

    "sectionName": "UK news", 
    "webTitle": "Mike Ashley says he is working on bid for BHS", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley, the billionaire founder of Sports Direct, has said he is working on a bid for BHS that would prevent job losses among its 11,000 staff and keep all branches open. Ashley held talks with BHS\u2019s owner, Dominic Chappell, about buying the department store group until shortly before it entered administration a week ago but opted not to bid. But with hopes growing that a deal could be struck to save the 88-year-old store group, Ashley said at the weekend he remained interested in purchasing the entire business. \u201cAny continuing interest that we have in BHS would be on the basis that we would anticipate that there would not be any job losses, including jobs at head office, and that all stores would remain open,\u201d Ashley said in a statement to the Telegraph. It is not clear what plans Ashley has in mind for BHS if he were to buy it but he appears keen to diversify into non-sports retail and is always on the lookout for new outlets for his goods. Ashley\u2019s retail empire stretches beyond his core Sports Direct chain and includes the upmarket clothing chain Flannels, which will be opening a large London store in Oxford Street. Ashley has also added Sports Direct concessions to Debenhams after taking a stake in the department store group, which he considered buying. Pledging no job losses or store closures is an unusual commitment for any businessman considering a bid for a loss-making business such as BHS. Flannels swung from a loss to a profit in the year to April 2015, helped by moving its admin functions to Sports Direct\u2019s head office. BHS was forced into administration on 25 April after Chappell failed to secure last-minute funding to keep the business afloat or to do a deal with Ashley. Stores continue to trade and staff are being paid while the administrator, Duff &amp; Phelps, seeks a buyer. Hopes for a rescue were low at first given BHS\u2019s financial plight, including \u00a31.3bn of debt and a \u00a3571m pension deficit. But the administrators are said to be increasingly optimistic about a deal to save at least a substantial part of the business and its 164 stores. Allan Leighton, chairman of the Co-operative Group, is said to be considering a bid for a large number of BHS stores, nine years after stepping down as BHS chairman. Leighton, a veteran retailer who helped turn round Asda in the 90s, is one of a number of potential bidders interested in elements of BHS. Other interested parties are said to include Christo Wiese, the South African billionaire who is snapping up UK high street chains, and Philip Day, the owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mill. BHS\u2019s failure, the biggest retail administration since the demise of Woolworths in 2008, has provoked recriminations. The retailer was owned by Sir Philip Green for 15 years before the Topshop tycoon sold it to Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions consortium last year. MPs want to question Green about his ownership of BHS and in particular about dividends, rent and interest paid to Green and his wife, Tina, by BHS during their ownership of the business. On Sunday, MPs on two select committees said they wanted Lady Green, who was a trustee of BHS, to join her husband to answer questions in parliament about the collapse of BHS. The work and pensions committee would like to ask the Greens about dividends paid out by BHS and how its pension deficit will affect the UK\u2019s Pension Protection Fund, which is funded by contributions from other pension pots. MPs on the business committee would like to ask the couple about the sale and acquisition of BHS by Chappell, who had no retail background and has also been called as a witness.",

Flannels swung from a loss to a profit in the year to April 2015, helped by moving its admin functions to Sports Direct\u2019s head office.</p> <p>BHS was forced into administration on 25 April after Chappell failed to secure last-minute funding to keep the business afloat or to do a deal with Ashley. Stores continue to trade and staff are being paid while the administrator, Duff &amp; Phelps, seeks a buyer.</p> <p>Hopes for a rescue were low at first given BHS\u2019s financial plight, including \u00a31.3bn of debt and a \u00a3571m pension deficit. But the administrators are said to be increasingly optimistic about a deal to save at least a substantial part of the business and its 164 stores. </p> <p>Allan Leighton, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/19/co-operative-group-confirm-allan-leighton-chairman\">chairman of the Co-operative Group</a>, is said to be considering a bid for a large number of BHS stores, nine years after stepping down as BHS chairman. Leighton, a veteran retailer who helped turn round Asda in the 90s, is one of a number of potential bidders interested in elements of BHS.</p> <p>Other interested parties are said to include Christo Wiese, the South African billionaire <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/15/new-look-deal-south-african-tycoon\">who is snapping up UK high street chains</a>, and Philip Day, the owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mill.<br /></p> <p>BHS\u2019s failure, the biggest retail administration since the demise of Woolworths in 2008, has provoked recriminations.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s that for the day. Stay on the site for close of play reports from Mike Selvey at Trent Bridge and Vic Marks at Taunton. Bye. Oddly enough at tea both sides had good reason to be pleased with themselves \u2013 Lancashire because they had lost only three wickets, Somerset because they had conceded only 171 runs in 66 overs, 25 of which have been bowled by left-arm spinners. This is not quite the brave new world that the ECB is looking forward \u2013 at least I hope it\u2019s not. Here the spinners are bowling primarily because there is nothing in the pitch for the quicker bowlers. Very occasionally the ball has turned and we can understand how the ECB is keen to advance the scope for spin bowlers. But a good pitch has pace and this one is lacking that vital attribute. In the afternoon session Karl Brown was lbw propping forward to Leach and Luke Procter played around a straight ball from Tim Groenewald. In between Alviro Petersen, back on one of his old stamping grounds, has looked composed with plenty of time to choose which shot to play. Steven Croft is keeping calm company. Neither Overton has taken a wicket; both have bowled well and they look the part. And both are sufficiently raw not to get too grumpy at the slowness of the surface. They keep bounding in. Well, the thinktank at the ECB wanted to get the spinners involved. So Jack Leach, Somerset\u2019s left-armer, has bowled nine overs before lunch on the first day (for only eight runs) and has taken the solitary wicket to fall. Lancashire are 76-1 after 34 overs. The ball is not turning but Leach has landed it in the right place and has commanded respect. On a sluggish, brown surface (I\u2019m sticking with the \u201cflat, draw\u201d prediction) he has been hard to hit. He\u2019s returning from a stress fracture, so this was an impressive effort. He will have plenty more bowling in this match. Somerset\u2019s seamers bowled with discipline but their patience may be tested by this pitch. Clearly, Peter Trego has been at his most persuasive recently \u2013 he\u2019s never been reluctant to offer an opinion. Here he was given the new ball and when not bowling he was stationed at first slip. However the Overton brothers and Tim Groenewald looked rather more threatening \u2013 curiously Lewis Gregory has been rotated. For Lancashire, the 19-year-old Haseeb Hameed impressed until he drove a catch to short extra cover. His partner Karl Brown has been businesslike and is unbeaten on 43. It is not looking very cheerful over the Quantocks. It may not be that cheerful in the Somerset dressing room. There is some toil ahead. Yorkshire have emerged from the first session in better spirits than they might have expected after a masterclass of half-volley bowling. The tone was set when the first two deliveries of Jack Brooks\u2019 opening over were dispatched through the covers by Steve Mullaney and they rarely let up thereafter. Better on this pitch to err on the side of full, as Mullaney demonstrated by pulling sixes from David Willey and Liam Plunkett on the two occasions they did drag the length back \u2013 but this was overdoing it. Two of the three wickets to fall, for 132, did go to Brooks, the first of which, that of Alex Hales, brought to a conclusion a very Hales-ish innings in which he dispatched the bad ball well and then got out, although not to a good one but to another half-volley that he drilled straight at a fielder just placed at short extra cover for the start of a second spell by Brooks. Brooks then took the wicket of Greg Smith, who dragged a wide half-volley on to his middle stump. A third wicket, that of Mullaney for 78, fell with what was the last ball of the session as he pushed at a mercifully good length ball from Patterson, that bounced a fraction and was caught by Lees at first slip at the second attempt. Visits to the press box this morning from two old adversaries in Alan Butcher, who has a book to publicise, and John Hampshire. I have video of highlights of the 1980 Gillette final between Middlesex and Surrey, and the only delivery of mine shows Butch belting me into the Mound Stand for six. It scarcely does justice to eventual figures of 12-7-17-2 but then a minimum of 60 dot balls wouldn\u2019t make great highlights. Meanwhile, during the lunch interval, there is the sight, on the outfield, of eight lads, dressed as zebras, playing cricket. They may be labouring under the misapprehension that this is the Saturday of a Test match but I doubt it. They are probably just barking. County blog a bit late on parade, but game is under way ( or should that, in the nautical sense be under weigh? I often wonder). As Ali has pointed out in his preview to this round of matches, there is a Test trial feel to this game at Trent Bridge. Certainly there are players \u2013 Alex Hales, Adam Lyth, Adil Rashid, David Willey perhaps \u2013 all with something to prove. At the moment, Yorkshire have got off to a shabby start with the ball, having opted, as is their right as the visiting team, to field first. Willey, making his Yorkshire debut in place of the injured Ryan Sidebottom, swung the new ball from the pavilion end, and Jack Brooks, at the other end, gave it every opportunity, serving up a diet of half volleys, readily dispatched. So at the moment, Notts are 40-0 from 6 overs, with Hales 21 and Mullaney 17. It is incidentally a pleasure to be in what is one of the world\u2019s best cricket press boxes after enduring what is indisputably one of the worst at the Oval last week. It makes such a difference to reporting the game when you can actually see it. Greetings from Taunton where I\u2019m watching a red ball for the first time since September. There was a toss at 1030; Lancashire won it and are batting. You can divine from this that the pitch is browner than is often the case at Taunton, where green grass has often been visible on the first day in recent times. This was done not so much to deliver extravagant movement but to retain some pace in the pitch. The major concern about the new toss regulations is that they will produce bland pitches, favoured by batsmen, as groundsmen play safe. It is too early to come to too many conclusions about this but so far there have been a lot of runs and a lot of draws. As ever we could just blame the weather. It\u2019s been sporadically damp and very cold. Freezing conditions favour batsmen. It is easier for them to keep warm and the ball is less inclined to swing from frozen fingers. After two balls I\u2019m inclined to repeat the prognostication of one of my press colleagues, memorably delivered with absolute authority in Johannesburg in 1999 in Duncan Fletcher\u2019s first game as England coach. \u201cFlat. Draw\u201d, he declared with Churchillian certainty. Within a quarter of an hour England were 2-4 against South Africa. We are watching from a swish new press box in Somerset\u2019s latest pavilion. High in the sky and we can see more of the Quantocks than ever before (although there is talk of rain later). The Wifi appears to be working well and there is coffee at the back. And it\u2019s warm in here. So morale is relatively high. After a quarter of an hour Lancashire are 5-0. It really does look flat.",

    "webTitle": "Leaked TTIP documents cast doubt on EU-US trade deal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Talks for a free trade deal between Europe and the US face a serious impasse with \u201cirreconcilable\u201d differences in some areas, according to leaked negotiating texts. The two sides are also at odds over US demands that would require the EU to break promises it has made on environmental protection. President Obama said last week he was confident a deal could be reached. But the leaked negotiating drafts and internal positions, which were obtained by Greenpeace and seen by the Guardian, paint a very different picture. \u201cDiscussions on cosmetics remain very difficult and the scope of common objectives fairly limited,\u201d says one internal note by EU trade negotiators. Because of a European ban on animal testing, \u201cthe EU and US approaches remain irreconcilable and EU market access problems will therefore remain,\u201d the note says. Talks on engineering were also \u201ccharacterised by continuous reluctance on the part of the US to engage in this sector,\u201d the confidential briefing says. These problems are not mentioned in a separate report on the state of the talks, also leaked, which the European commission has prepared for scrutiny by the European parliament. These outline the positions exchanged between EU and US negotiators between the 12th and the 13th round of TTIP talks, which took place in New York last week. The public document offers a robust defence of the EU\u2019s right to regulate and create a court-like system for disputes, unlike the internal note, which does not mention them. Jorgo Riss, the director of Greenpeace EU, said: \u201cThese leaked documents give us an unparalleled look at the scope of US demands to lower or circumvent EU protections for environment and public health as part of TTIP. The EU position is very bad, and the US position is terrible. The prospect of a TTIP compromising within that range is an awful one. The way is being cleared for a race to the bottom in environmental, consumer protection and public health standards.\u201d US proposals include an obligation on the EU to inform its industries of any planned regulations in advance, and to allow them the same input into EU regulatory processes as European firms. American firms could influence the content of EU laws at several points along the regulatory line, including through a plethora of proposed technical working groups and committees. \u201cBefore the EU could even pass a regulation, it would have to go through a gruelling impact assessment process in which the bloc would have to show interested US parties that no voluntary measures, or less exacting regulatory ones, were possible,\u201d Riss said. The US is also proposing new articles on \u201cscience and risk\u201d to give firms greater regulatory say. Disputes over pesticides residues and food safety would be dealt with by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation\u2019s Codex Alimentarius system. Environmentalists say the body has loose rules on corporate influence, allowing employees of companies such as BASF, Nestle and Coca Cola to sit on \u2013 and sometimes lead \u2013 national delegations. Some 44% of its decisions on pesticides residues have been less stringent than EU ones, with 40% of rough equivalence and 16% being more demanding, according to Greenpeace. GM foods could also find a widening window into Europe, with the US pushing for a working group to adopt a \u201clow level presence initiative\u201d. This would allow the import of cargo containing traces of unauthorised GM strains. The EU currently blocks these because of food safety and cross-pollination concerns. The EU has not yet accepted the US demands, but they are uncontested in the negotiators\u2019 note, and no counter-proposals have been made in these areas. In January, the EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m said [pdf] the precautionary principle, obliging regulatory caution where there is scientific doubt, was a core and non-negotiable EU principle. She said: \u201cWe will defend the precautionary approach to regulation in Europe, in TTIP and in all our other agreements.\u201d But the principle is not mentioned in the 248 pages of TTIP negotiating texts. The European commission has also promised to safeguard environmental laws, defend international standards and protect the EU\u2019s right to set high green benchmarks in future. But the new leak will not placate critics of the deal, who have pointed to attempts by fossil fuel firms and others to influence its outcome, as a sign of things to come. The EU negotiators internal note says \u201cthe US expressed that it would have to consult with its chemical industry on how to position itself\u201d on issues of market access for non-agricultural goods. Where industry lobbying in regulatory processes is concerned, the US also \u201cinsisted\u201d that the EU be \u201crequired\u201d to involve US experts in its development of electrotechnical standards.",

The EU position is very bad, and the US position is terrible. The prospect of a TTIP compromising within that range is an awful one. The way is being cleared for a race to the bottom in environmental, consumer protection and public health standards.\u201d</p> <p>US proposals include an obligation on the EU to inform its industries of any planned regulations in advance, and to allow them the same input into EU regulatory processes as European firms. </p> <p>American firms could influence the content of EU laws at several points along the regulatory line, including through a plethora of proposed technical working groups and committees.</p> <p>\u201cBefore the EU could even pass a regulation, it would have to go through a gruelling impact assessment process in which the bloc would have to show interested US parties that no voluntary measures, or less exacting regulatory ones, were possible,\u201d Riss said.</p> <p>The US is also proposing new articles on \u201cscience and risk\u201d to give firms greater regulatory say. Disputes over pesticides residues and food safety would be dealt with by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/fao-who-codexalimentarius/en/\">Codex Alimentarius</a> system.</p> <p>Environmentalists say the body has loose rules on corporate influence, allowing employees of companies <a href=\"http://www.essen-ohne-chemie.info/ttip-pestizide/\">such as BASF, Nestle </a><a href=\"http://www.essen-ohne-chemie.info/ttip-pestizide/\">and Coca Cola</a> to sit on \u2013 and sometimes lead \u2013 national delegations. Some 44% of its decisions on pesticides residues have been less stringent than EU ones, with 40% of rough equivalence and 16% being more demanding, according to Greenpeace.</p> <p>GM foods could also find a widening window into Europe, with the US pushing for a working group to adopt a \u201clow level presence initiative\u201d. This would allow the import of cargo containing traces of unauthorised GM strains.

She ran the centre for more than 20 years and had an encyclopedic knowledge of welfare benefits, which she used to help the local community. Pam was something of a celebrity in Fulham; she could not go shopping without residents stopping her for advice or simply thanking her for her help. Her parents, Fred and Ellen Hull, were East Enders but Pam was born in East Acton, west London, behind Wormwood Scrubs, as the family had been rehoused in one of the new prefabs following the devastation of the East End during the blitz. Pam was a bright child but when she was offered a job as a junior in an architects\u2019 firm in Sloane Square she jumped at the chance and left school. She had been promoted to office manager by the time she joined the FLAC in 1989. The centre became Pam\u2019s second home. She remained there until it folded in 2013, following the withdrawal of funding by the local council. For more than 40 years FLAC, with its open-door policy, had helped thousands of individuals. Pam worked tirelessly, in the evenings coordinating teams of volunteer lawyers (many of whom are now partners in City firms, QCs and judges), while giving benefit and housing advice by day. Pam knew the social security system inside out. While she was not overtly political, she had an acute sense of justice. Pam always kept her composure, which was put to the test one evening when a client pulled out a machete. She kept her assailant calm until the police arrived. After separating from her husband Jimmy Donohue, Pam brought up her children single-handedly, working throughout. After FLAC closed down, Pam devoted herself to her family. And she loved nothing more than looking out of her living-room window, watching the hustle and bustle of Fulham Broadway below.

It is like asking a lung specialist to smoke a cigarette. Yet that\u2019s what happened when Nicky Morgan addressed the National Association of Head Teachers conference yesterday. They objected partly to her programme of turning all schools into academies by 2020 and partly to her luminously daft insistence that \u201ctesting\u201d, \u201cimproving\u201d and \u201ceducating\u201d are interchangeable words. Her government \u201cintroduced the phonics check for six-year-olds, and 100,000 more young people are able to read better as a result,\u201d she told the BBC when she first became education secretary, and she has been trotting out the same nonsense ever since. No amount of disagreement from professionals in the field dents her faith or alters her rhetoric. Indeed, since the Michael Gove era, teachers have been treated as recalcitrant by definition, motivated by sloth, their years of experience reframed not as wisdom but as burnout. When they object to a policy, that merely proves what a sorely needed challenge it poses to their cushy lives. When they shout \u201crubbish\u201d in a conference hall, it is yet more evidence of what a dangerous bunch of trots they are. On Tuesday, parents enter the fray, with a school boycott organised by Let Our Kids Be Kids, to protest against \u201cunnecessary testing and a curriculum that limits enjoyment and real understanding\u201d. Some have been galvanised by the bizarre and unnecessary sight of their children in distress, others by solidarity with the teachers \u2013 who inconveniently continue to command a great deal of respect among people who actually meet with them \u2013 and others who can\u2019t join in the boycott because of minor administrative details such as having to go to work, but have signed the petition. It is the beginning of a new activism \u2013 muscular, cooperative and agile because it has to be. If the only problem is that it causes anxiety to a load of pampered under-10s, shouldn\u2019t they just suck it up? Isn\u2019t that the best way to learn what the world is like? The framing of this debate is precisely wrong. No serious educationalist thinks that the way to drive up standards among children is to make tests more frequent and more exacting. Nor does anybody of any expertise really believe that teachers need to be incentivised by results. It is an incredibly tough, demanding, indifferently remunerated job, which nobody would do except as a vocation. It is not for the profession or the parents to explain what the tests are doing to the kids; it is for the education secretary to explain what these tests are for. By coincidence, at the end of last week, Randi Weingarten, head of the American Federation of Teachers, was in London to hand in a petition to Pearson, the education company and provider of curriculums and test delivery. The petition protested against two perceived issues: concerns about over-testing in US schools and alleged profiteering in the global south. The trajectory in US education, from universal public provision with local accountability to mass outsourcing and centralised control, is strikingly similar to what has happened here. It begins with the creation of a failure narrative, \u201cthat both the Democrats and the Republican bought into, which is, the sky is falling, the sky is falling, the sky is falling\u201d, Weingarten told me. That creates the rationale for testing, since, without data, you can\u2019t tell whether you\u2019re improving. Those tests are consequential: the results can be used to fire teachers, close down schools, hold pupils back a year. All the most profound decisions in education can suddenly be made by an algorithm, with no human judgment necessary. Simultaneously, says Weingarten, Charter schools were introduced, originally \u2013 like academies \u2013 \u201cas part of a bigger public school system where you could incubate ideas\u201d, but very soon remodelled as a way to supplant rather than supplement the existing system. \u201cAnd in between all of this, you started seeing the marketisation and the monetisation.\u201d Until things can be counted, there isn\u2019t much scope to create a market. I was never fully convinced that academisation and hyper-testing were undertaken to create the market conditions for privatisation down the line; I thought it more plausible that the testing was merely a politician\u2019s wheeze to create data out of humans that could then be stuffed into manifestos to persuade other humans that the policies were going in the right direction. Yet the parallels between the US and England are insistent \u2013 it has become impossible to ignore the idea that our government is mimicking theirs for a reason. Whether all this is a prelude to privatisation or a PR stunt for a chaotic government doesn\u2019t actually matter in the medium term: to put seven-year-olds under intolerable pressure for either of those ends would be equally abhorrent. In the long term, the mutation of schools into joyless exam factories won\u2019t be halted by resistance alone, we also need to make a proper account of what education is for. As Weingarten describes, \u201cWe have to help kids build relationships. We have to address their life skills, so they can negotiate the world. We have to help kids build resilience. We have to help kids learn how to problem-solve, how to think, how to engage. So tell me, how are any of these things tested on a standardised test?\u201d That\u2019s a test question for the tin-eared secretary of state herself.",

We have to address their life skills, so they can negotiate the world. We have to help kids build resilience. We have to help kids learn how to problem-solve, how to think, how to engage. So tell me, how are any of these things tested on a standardised test?\u201d That\u2019s a test question for the tin-eared secretary of state herself.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Thomas Voeckler is now an elder statesman at 36, and in his 16th season as a professional, but winning still holds the same savour for the Frenchman who could not hide his delight after cannily outsprinting Nicolas Roche to take the Tour de Yorkshire. The three-day race was decided by a two-man sprint in the final metres, where Voeckler showed all his experience to catch Roche napping, even though the Irishman is far from being a callow debutant. \u201cIncroyable, ho, ho, ho,\u201d was Voeckler\u2019s verdict, his grizzled face bearing an ecstatic smile. He had showed his interest in the overall standings as early as day one when he sneaked a time bonus en route to Settle, which gave him a two-second advantage over Roche. The pair escaped over the final climb of Oliver\u2019s Mount on the outskirts of Scarborough, and once away they both knew whoever won the finish sprint played out before a crowd perched on the grassy slopes above North Parade would take overall victory. Roche recorded the same time but finished six seconds back overall once bonus seconds were applied. The outcome marked a popular victory for a Direct Energie rider in the twilight of his career who needs wins like this to keep him in the saddle. It came at the expense of Team Sky, who dominated the 198km stage, repeatedly splitting the field over a tough course. They ended up with three riders in an elite lead group but were prevented from repeating last year\u2019s overall win \u2013 for the Norwegian Lars Petter Nordhaug \u2013 by Voeckler\u2019s racing nous, the same quality that has given him stage wins in the Tour de France and two decent spells in the yellow jersey in 2004 and 2011. It was that simple in the end but what came earlier was a constantly changing pattern of events over a stage with a brutal profile; a final 100km that was worthy of a one-day Classic if not better than some of recent date. After an initial sort-out over the windswept moors of Blakey Ridge Sky grabbed the race by the scruff of the neck as a large lead group approached the Grosmont climb. The national champion, Peter Kennaugh, set a searing pace and the race leader, Dylan Groenewegen, was already struggling as the road went constantly up and down. After the steep ascent out of Grosmont an exposed stretch of road enabled Sky to slash the lead group to only 10 men in a lightning move that would have won them the race if the finish had been a few kilometres distant. The British squad\u2019s four strongest riders assembled around Kennaugh but a change in wind direction made for a regrouping, with 25 riders coming together through Whitby to tackle the short, steep pull out of Robin Hood\u2019s Bay. The Belgian Serge Pauwels attempted to break Sky\u2019s stranglehold and a further selection took place, with the group topping the climb only 15 strong. That elite group included three from Sky (Roche, the young Gianni Moscon and Nordhaug), Adam Yates, who probably welcomed the distraction of some intense racing after his brother Simon\u2019s troubles during the week, Voeckler and Tom Stewart of the home team Madison-Genesis. The best rider overall was Nikias Arndt of Giant who had started the stage third overall thanks to time bonuses, and the issue then became how to get rid of the German. After the lead group had swelled again Roche started the final showdown by escaping with Yates and Steven Kruijswijk of the Lotto-Jumbo team as the race left Robin Hood\u2019s Bay, and Voeckler later linked up with Anthony Turgis of the Cofidis team with 18km remaining into Scarborough. Arndt set up a solo chase but to no avail, meaning the climb up the motor racing circuit of Oliver\u2019s Mount would be critical. The quintet split, again under Roche\u2019s impulsion, while behind Moscon and Nordhaug set off in pursuit of the minor placings. It reflected Sky\u2019s physical and numerical dominance of the day but in the final metres tactics were what mattered and Voeckler came off best. He is known for racing with his tongue hanging out as he shows the television cameras just how hard he is working. Here, it was far more than mere theatrics.",

      "bodyText": "My godmother Margaret Miller, who has died of cancer aged 76, was a healer and teacher of Qi Gong, the ancient Chinese system of breathing, posture, focus and spiritual welfare. She was a glowing advertisement for her own abilities. Diagnosed with a breast tumour at 50, she lived for another quarter of a century and became an accomplished ballroom dancer. She was born Margaret Pitman a few days before the second world war broke out, into a family that was patrician but progressive. Her great-grandfather, Sir Isaac, had invented Pitman shorthand; her father, Sir James, a Tory MP, devised the Initial Teaching Alphabet. Margaret grew up in London before working in publishing and as a tour guide. She once startled her mother, Beau, by announcing that she and a girlfriend were going to drive from London to Athens via communist Budapest. She married Tim Miller, a businessman, in 1965, and had three children, Christopher, Katherine and Leila. Their house in Addison Road, Kensington, was full of light and laughter, and their holiday home, an old mill near Avignon, was dreamy. As a godparent, she was a godsend: she made me illicit cassettes of Beatles LPs, employed me as a Latin tutor, and lent me the mill for my honeymoon. When Tim got cancer, Margaret felt that chemotherapy only made it worse, which led her to join the National Federation of Spiritual Healers. After he died in 1982, she helped run the federation\u2019s London branch while bringing the children up on her own. She taught both Qi Gong and the Soul Plan, which aims to reconnect people with life\u2019s purpose. Following her own diagnosis, she practised healing for up to four hours a day, studied under the Qi Gong master Zhixing Wang, and drank a lot of hot water with lime. In her 70s, she took up dancing, forming a delighted partnership with the classical dancer Benny Maslov; they can be found on YouTube, doing the foxtrot at the 2014 London Pro-Am Dance Extravaganza. Margaret\u2019s striking blue eyes exuded warmth and playfulness, with the odd flash of steel. In February, when her cancer had finally spread, she was visited by a hospital chaplain. \u201cI have to tell you,\u201d she said, \u201cthat I\u2019m not at all afraid of death.\u201d She is survived by her children and two of her three brothers. There was time to draft her own death notice, which said she had died peacefully, \u201csupported by her children and grandchildren\u201d. After writing that, she inserted \u201cadored\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The former Tory Foreign Office minister Sayeeda Warsi has expressed exasperation at Zac Goldsmith\u2019s increasingly strident tone as he seeks to make up ground before Thursday\u2019s vote for London mayor. Goldsmith, who is as much as 20 percentage points behind Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan, again sought to tar his rival with the brush of extremism in a piece in the Mail on Sunday. The comment piece was illustrated with a picture of the bus destroyed by a suicide bomber in the 2005 terrorist attacks in London. Lady Warsi, who resigned from the government in protest against its policy on Gaza, tweeted her disappointment, if not at Goldsmith himself then at his campaign\u2019s scare tactics. In his comment piece, Goldsmith wrote: \u201cThe number one job of any mayor of London is to keep our city safe. Yet if Labour wins on Thursday, we will have handed control of the Met, and with it control over national counter-terrorism policy, to a party whose candidate and current leadership have, whether intentionally or not, repeatedly legitimised those with extremist views.\u201d Apart from attempts to portray his rival as soft on extremists, the Goldsmith campaign has been criticised for using divisive tactics by specifically targeting minority ethnic voters with a warning that a vote for Khan would put their family heirlooms at risk. Goldsmith\u2019s attempt to court the Indian vote took a farcical turn, however, when when the self-proclaimed Bollywood enthusiast could not name a single Bollywood film or actor while being questioned on camera. \u201cLet me think \u2026 No I\u2019m not going to give you one. I can\u2019t think of a favourite,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a favourite. I love almost everything about Bollywood. I love the atmosphere, the colour and I love the excitement. I want as much Bollywood as possible here in London as possible.\u201d Although the frontrunner, Khan has acknowledged that the antisemitism row engulfing his party after the suspension of Naz Shah, the Bradford West MP, and the remarks by the former London mayor, Ken Livingstone, on Hitler and zionism, could harm his chance of becoming the first Muslim to occupy the post. In an interview with the Observer, Khan, the son of a bus driver, said he would not be thrown off course by the controversy, but conceded there could be electoral fallout that would damage him and his party. \u201cI accept that the comments that Ken Livingstone has made make it more difficult for Londoners of Jewish faith to feel that the Labour party is a place for them, and so I will carry on doing what I have always been doing, which is to speak for everyone. If I should have the privilege to be the mayor I will show Londoners the sort of mayor I can be.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Wednesday 27 April was Administrative Professionals\u2019 Day, formerly National Secretaries Day \u2013 an annual celebration begun in the US in 1952. A heavily gendered date, it is traditionally an opportunity for florists and chocolatiers. But this year, a movie grabbed a slice of the pie. That movie was Ghostbusters, the forthcoming reboot of the beloved supernatural comedy that sees Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon don the jumpsuits once worn by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson. In Ivan Reitman\u2019s 1984 original, the secretary was Janine: goggle glasses, pixie cut, questionable telephone manner (\u201cWaddya want?\u201d). In Paul Feig\u2019s version, it\u2019s Kevin: a ditzy blond hired for his hunkiness not his shorthand. The clips released to coincide with Administrative Professionals\u2019 Day \u2013 Kevin baffled by the phone, botching the tea run, eagerly drafting inappropriate logos (think busty ghosts) \u2013 brilliantly showcase the gender flip that is one of the movie\u2019s key USPs. The step-change can still leave you giddy. Twelve months ago, Chris Hemsworth, the actor who plays Kevin, was in every multiplex as Thor, he of the unreconstructed chivalry and massive mallet. Off screen, we were still in the early days of the gender inequality debate \u2013 sparked the previous winter by the revelation that Jennifer Lawrence was paid less than her American Hustle co-stars, and stoked by Patricia Arquette, who called for pay parity in her Oscar acceptance speech. The debate faded a little as other industry inequalities took the spotlight, but it still smoulders on, , and reignited recently by Daniel Radcliffe and Scarlett Johansson. \u201cThe thing I can\u2019t help but think,\u201d said Radcliffe, \u201cis what guy is sitting in a studio somewhere thinking, \u2018Let\u2019s fuck the girls out of some money?\u2019\u201d New studies revealed only one in five European films is directed by a woman \u2013 and all movies being made by two major Hollywood studios (Sony and Paramount) over the next two years will be directed by men. Yet the schedules tell a different story: although most women may still be getting a rough deal backstage, at the cinema, female films are front-and-centre. Not just that. These are female-led films that don\u2019t just feature women mopping up after one another\u2019s heartbreaks, but exploring their own careers and, crucially, their friendships with each other. So we have the return of Bolly bezzies Edwina and Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie; Tina Fey and Margot Robbie bonding beneath the bombs in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot; Kate Beckinsale and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny cackling happily in Love &amp; Friendship, Greta Gerwig snuggling with one-time love-rival Julianne Moore in Maggie\u2019s Plan; Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell swapping horror stories in Bad Moms, and Bell (again) enjoying a slow-burn buddy-up with Melissa McCarthy (again) in The Boss. That final film opened in the US a month ago. Despite tepid reviews, it still proved victorious over Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice at the box office. Tina Fey can get a farce set in a contemporary warzone greenlit. McCarthy has star wattage enough to put even superheroes in the shade. The mother of these major summer movies is, of course, Ghostbusters. Anticipation for that reached fever pitch months ago, around the release of its first trailer, which has now been seen more than 60m times. This is a movie on which much rides. Its success would be a game-changer. Its failure would turn back the clock on much of the progress made so far. So who ya gonna call to find out how this kind of responsibility feels? Down the line from Los Angeles, Feig doesn\u2019t sound too fussed. He has been here before, after all: with box office-crushing Bridesmaids (2011) \u2013 still the best-performing Judd Apatow movie (he produced it) \u2013 and then at two-yearly intervals with The Heat (2013), the first truly funny female buddy cop movie, and Spy (2015), in which McCarthy out-ballsed James Bond. Yes, Feig says, \u201cmanaging and meeting and exceeding expectations\u201d is a challenge. \u201cBut I would hope we weren\u2019t being made the test case for whether women can star in tentpoles or not. That kind of litmus test just wouldn\u2019t be fair to women. If a movie starring a man comes out and bombs, people just think the movie didn\u2019t work. They don\u2019t say: \u201c\u2018Oh, well, OK! No more men in movies!\u2019\u201d But the fact that the film business does still react like this stems, he thinks, from its creation of a mythology to support the status quo. \u201cWhich is: men won\u2019t go to see these movies starring women. Hollywood\u2019s always looking for a way to get out of a risky situation and if people are still considering movies starring women to be risky \u2013 well, that\u2019s very unfair to the women.\u201d When he was starting out, Feig says, he would pitch a project with a female lead, only to be told it wasn\u2019t an option because: \u201cMen won\u2019t go see that movie, and in foreign markets movies with women don\u2019t do so well.\u201d The only way to refute this, he says, was to prove them wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say there should be more great roles for women, but if you don\u2019t create them it\u2019s all lip-service. You gotta put your money where your mouth is and actually do it. Everybody in positions of power \u2013 especially men but women too \u2013 has gotta step up.\u201d The venom behind some of the reaction to the new Ghostbusters casting could be seen to confirm a sense that some men simply aren\u2019t interested in stories about the opposite sex. Last year, Feig called some of the comments \u201cvile, misogynistic shit\u201d; today, he questions the relevance of that backlash. The bigger problem, he thinks, lies with the internet \u2013 \u201cwhich puts a small minority of voices into a sort of bullhorn\u201d \u2013 and the media, which amplify this negativity. \u201cIt makes me sad that informs every article now. There\u2019s always some comment about how people are down on it. Well, somebody is down on everything. It\u2019s very easy once you\u2019re predisposed to be pissed about something to watch it and find fault.\u201d Plus, people are conditioned by what they see on screen. There is a duty to broaden that scope and try to persuade people out of such prejudice. \u201cHollywood has created a situation in which women come off as bad or subservient or unlikable or boring because those are the roles written for them. What character looks great telling the hero that he shouldn\u2019t be saving the world, that he should be spending more time with his family? Nobody! \u201cSo guys go: \u2018There\u2019s another woman doing what my mom does or my wife does, just browbeats me and yells at me all the time.\u2019 And it\u2019s like: \u2018Yeah, because somebody wrote it that way. They didn\u2019t give her another dimension.\u2019 So it all spirals down the vortex and you\u2019re stuck.\u201d McCarthy knows that claustrophobia. \u201cIf you don\u2019t give actors tools,\u201d she has said, \u201cinsecurities, bad habits and quirks and ticks, you\u2019re just playing \u2018blonde and leggy\u2019. Those aren\u2019t character choices, those are physical descriptions \u2026 All humans go up and down and have their good days and bad days; it\u2019s what makes them interesting.\u201d Yet there is a further curiosity here. This summer\u2019s female-friendship movies do not just share a theme and a gender but a genre, too. They are all comedies. Could it be that this is another reason women\u2019s stories can be taken less seriously? Cinema has long prized drama over everything else. The lighter something appears, the easier it is to dismiss. Feig isn\u2019t sure. Young adult franchises such as Hunger Games and Divergent changed the game too, he says; but rather than being female ensembles, they were films in which a leading lady is usually flanked by a couple of would-be boyfriends. He makes comedies, he says, because that seems the best way of allowing for the greatest complexity. \u201cI don\u2019t like this term \u2018strong female characters\u2019 because that implies if a woman is gonna be in a comedy she\u2019s gotta be tough and invincible and not vulnerable and to act more like a man. That\u2019s almost as bad as not having women in a movie.\u201d Here, he thinks, lies the biggest pitfall in trying to fast-track progress: you need to start from scratch. \u201cProgress is not simply having women act like men. We need to make sure all the characters are fully fleshed-out. Men and women need to police each other to ensure stereotypes are dodged: crews must always be mixed, people must always speak out. I\u2019m still a guy. I\u2019m still going to come up with ideas I think would be funny and then a woman will say: \u2018We would never say that.\u2019\u201d One of the funniest moments in the trailer for the new Ghostbusters involves Wiig and McCarthy apologising for speaking over one another. The line in the original film regularly voted the best involves Murray calling someone \u201cdickless\u201d. How swiftly insults can sound like assets.",

Off screen, we were still in the early days of the gender inequality debate \u2013 sparked the previous winter by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/12/sony-email-hack-jennifer-lawrence-paid-less-american-hustle\">revelation</a> that Jennifer Lawrence was paid less than her American Hustle co-stars, and stoked by Patricia Arquette, who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wx-Qh4Vczc\">called for pay parity</a> in her Oscar acceptance speech.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cCqOZDu2-w\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4cCqOZDu2-w?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Clips from Ghostbusters released to coincide with Adminstrative Professionals\u2019 Day.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The debate faded a little as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/25/oscarssowhite-right-and-wrong-academy-awards-audience\">other industry inequalities</a> took the spotlight, but it still smoulders on, , and reignited recently by Daniel Radcliffe and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/08/scarlett-johansson-talking-about-the-hollywood-gender-wage-gap-is-icky\">Scarlett Johansson</a>. \u201cThe thing I can\u2019t help but think,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/26/daniel-radcliffe-films-gender-pay-gap-inequality-harry-potter\">said Radcliffe</a>, \u201cis what guy is sitting in a studio somewhere thinking, \u2018Let\u2019s fuck the girls out of some money?\u2019\u201d New studies revealed only <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/28/one-in-five-films-europe-directed-woman\">one in five European films</a> is directed by a woman \u2013 and all movies being made by two major Hollywood studios (Sony and Paramount) over the next two years <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/21/hollywood-paramount-20th-century-fox-no-female-directors\">will be directed by men</a>.</p> <p>Yet the schedules tell a different story: although most women may still be getting a rough deal backstage, at the cinema, female films are front-and-centre. Not just that. These are female-led films that don\u2019t just feature women mopping up after one another\u2019s heartbreaks, but exploring their own careers and, crucially, their friendships with each other.</p> <p>So we have the return of Bolly bezzies Edwina and Patsy in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/absolutely-fabulous--the-movie\">Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie</a>; Tina Fey and Margot Robbie bonding beneath the bombs in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/03/whiskey-tango-foxtrot-review-tina-fey-afghanistan-war-reporting\">Whiskey Tango Foxtrot</a>; Kate Beckinsale and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny cackling happily in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/24/love-friendship-review-kate-beckinsale-devious-delight-sundance\">Love &amp; Friendship</a>, Greta Gerwig snuggling with one-time love-rival Julianne Moore in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/13/maggies-plan-review-julianne-moore-steals-agreeably-messy-comedy\">Maggie\u2019s Plan</a>; Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell swapping horror stories in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4651520/reference\">Bad Moms</a>, and Bell (again) enjoying a slow-burn buddy-up with Melissa McCarthy (again) in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/06/the-boss-review-melissa-mccarthy\">The Boss</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c94bdcdc2d9b036a46f0e6dd37ab1f5db84fa4b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c94bdcdc2d9b036a46f0e6dd37ab1f5db84fa4b4/0_125_2717_1630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley in Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley in Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Planet Photos/Fox Searchlight</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That final film opened in the US a month ago. Despite tepid reviews, it still <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/11/the-boss-batman-v-superman-dawn-justice-box-office-melissa-mccarthy\">proved victorious</a> over Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice at the box office. Tina Fey can get a farce set in a contemporary warzone greenlit. McCarthy has star wattage enough to put even superheroes in the shade.</p> <p>The mother of these major summer movies is, of course, Ghostbusters. Anticipation for that reached fever pitch months ago, around the release of its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ugHP-yZXw\">first trailer</a>, which has now been seen more than 60m times. This is a movie on which much rides. Its success would be a game-changer. Its failure would turn back the clock on much of the progress made so far.</p> <p>So who ya gonna call to find out how this kind of responsibility feels? Down the line from Los Angeles, Feig doesn\u2019t sound too fussed. He has been here before, after all: with <a href=\"http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/bridesmaids_box_office_achievements_in_context\">box office-crushing</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/bridesmaids\">Bridesmaids</a> (2011) \u2013 still the best-performing Judd Apatow movie (he produced it) \u2013 and then at two-yearly intervals with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156167/heat\">The Heat</a> (2013), the first truly funny female buddy cop movie, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/04/spy-review-melissa-mccarthy-hotshot-heroine\">Spy</a> (2015), in which McCarthy out-ballsed James Bond.</p> <p>Yes, Feig says, \u201cmanaging and meeting and exceeding expectations\u201d is a challenge. \u201cBut I would hope we weren\u2019t being made the test case for whether women can star in tentpoles or not. That kind of litmus test just wouldn\u2019t be fair to women. If a movie starring a man comes out and bombs, people just think the movie didn\u2019t work. They don\u2019t say: \u201c\u2018Oh, well, OK! No more men in movies!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b413b93722eb8ebd1dffdef94c7ff990149d90fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b413b93722eb8ebd1dffdef94c7ff990149d90fd/0_0_3210_2140/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Beckinsale and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny in Love &amp; Friendship.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Beckinsale and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny in Love &amp; Friendship.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Westerly Films/Photoshot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the fact that the film business <em>does</em> still react like this stems, he thinks, from its creation of a mythology to support the status quo. \u201cWhich is: men won\u2019t go to see these movies starring women. Hollywood\u2019s always looking for a way to get out of a risky situation and if people are still considering movies starring women to be risky \u2013 well, that\u2019s very unfair to the women.\u201d</p> <p>When he was starting out, Feig says, he would pitch a project with a female lead, only to be told it wasn\u2019t an option because: \u201cMen won\u2019t go see that movie, and in foreign markets movies with women don\u2019t do so well.\u201d The only way to refute this, he says, was to prove them wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say there should be more great roles for women, but if you don\u2019t create them it\u2019s all lip-service. You gotta put your money where your mouth is and actually do it. Everybody in positions of power \u2013 especially men but women too \u2013 has gotta step up.\u201d</p> <p>The venom behind some of the reaction to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/27/all-female-ghostbusters-cast-melissa-mccarthy-kristen-wiig\">new Ghostbusters casting</a> could be seen to confirm a sense that some men simply aren\u2019t interested in stories about the opposite sex. Last year, Feig called some of the comments <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/16/paul-feig-ghostbusters-reboot-criticism-is-vile-misogynistic-shit\">\u201cvile, misogynistic shit\u201d</a>; today, he questions the relevance of that backlash. The bigger problem, he thinks, lies with the internet \u2013 \u201cwhich puts a small minority of voices into a sort of bullhorn\u201d \u2013 and the media, which amplify this negativity. \u201cIt makes me sad that informs every article now. There\u2019s always some comment about how people are down on it. Well, somebody is down on <em>everything</em>. It\u2019s very easy once you\u2019re predisposed to be pissed about something to watch it and find fault.\u201d</p> <p>Plus, people are conditioned by what they see on screen. There is a duty to broaden that scope and try to persuade people out of such prejudice. \u201cHollywood has created a situation in which women come off as bad or subservient or unlikable or boring because those are the roles written for them. What character looks great telling the hero that he shouldn\u2019t be saving the world, that he should be spending more time with his family? Nobody!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c2c25b738cdbd939cee26650bb297ead76280a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c2c25b738cdbd939cee26650bb297ead76280a3/0_0_3504_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bad Moms\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bad Moms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/STX Entertainment</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSo guys go: \u2018There\u2019s another <em>woman</em> doing what my mom does or my wife does, just browbeats me and yells at me all the time.\u2019 And it\u2019s like: \u2018Yeah, because somebody <em>wrote</em> it that way. They didn\u2019t give her another dimension.\u2019 So it all spirals down the vortex and you\u2019re stuck.\u201d</p> <p>McCarthy knows that claustrophobia. \u201cIf you don\u2019t give actors tools,\u201d she <a href=\"https://au.entertainment.yahoo.com/celebrity/news/a/31171302/melissa-mccarthy-on-female-roles-in-hollywood-video/\">has said</a>, \u201cinsecurities, bad habits and quirks and ticks, you\u2019re just playing \u2018blonde and leggy\u2019. Those aren\u2019t character choices, those are physical descriptions \u2026 All humans go up and down and have their good days and bad days; it\u2019s what makes them interesting.\u201d</p> <p>Yet there is a further curiosity here. This summer\u2019s female-friendship movies do not just share a theme and a gender but a genre, too. They are all comedies. Could it be that this is another reason women\u2019s stories can be taken less seriously? Cinema has long prized drama over everything else. The lighter something appears, the easier it is to dismiss. Feig isn\u2019t sure. Young adult franchises such as Hunger Games and Divergent changed the game too, he says; but rather than being female ensembles, they were films in which a leading lady is usually flanked by a couple of would-be boyfriends. He makes comedies, he says, because that seems the best way of allowing for the greatest complexity. \u201cI don\u2019t like this term \u2018strong female characters\u2019 because that implies if a woman is gonna be in a comedy she\u2019s gotta be tough and invincible and not vulnerable and to act more like a man. That\u2019s almost as bad as not having women in a movie.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ugHP-yZXw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w3ugHP-yZXw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Here, he thinks, lies the biggest pitfall in trying to fast-track progress: you need to start from scratch. \u201cProgress is not simply having women act like men. We need to make sure all the characters are fully fleshed-out. Men and women need to police each other to ensure stereotypes are dodged: crews must always be mixed, people must always speak out. I\u2019m still a guy. I\u2019m still going to come up with ideas I think would be funny and then a woman will say: \u2018We would <em>never</em> say that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>One of the funniest moments in the trailer for the new Ghostbusters involves Wiig and McCarthy apologising for speaking over one another. The line in the original film regularly voted the best involves Murray calling someone <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-b-CfHbPGQ\">\u201cdickless\u201d</a>. How swiftly insults can sound like assets.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A helicopter that crashed in Norway, killing 13 people including a Briton, had to return to base twice in the days before the incident owing to a warning light. The Super Puma had to turn back to Bergen airport, Flesland, last Tuesday when the pilot spotted the indication light, the operator CHC Helicopter confirmed on Sunday. An aircraft part was replaced and a test flight was conducted the following day. But that flight was also aborted and another component changed when the warning light reappeared. CHC said the aircraft went on to complete six commercial flights with no indications of problems on Thursday, the day before the fatal crash. The helicopter was carrying two crew and 11 passengers from the Gullfaks B oil field, about 74 miles (120km) off the Norwegian coast, when it crashed into the rocky shoreline of Tur\u00f8y, a tiny island near Bergen. Norwegian television showed footage of what appeared to be a helicopter rotor blade spiralling down minutes before the crash. A witness, Rebecca Andersen, told the newspaper Verdens Gang that the\u201crotor blades came rushing toward us \u2026 Then we heard a violent explosion.\u201d The 41-year-old British man killed in the crash was named as Iain Stuart, from Laurencekirk in Aberdeenshire. He worked for oilfield services company Halliburton. A statement released by relatives of the 41-year-old said: \u201cWe as a family are devastated at the loss of Iain in Friday\u2019s tragic helicopter crash in Norway. \u201cIain was a loving husband and devoted father to his two children and as a family we are heartbroken. He was a caring son, brother, uncle and friend to many. \u201cWe are appreciative of all the messages of support and kind thoughts. \u201cWe now ask, as a family, that we are allowed some privacy at this difficult and sad time to grieve and come to terms with our loss.\u201d A statement from CHC, issued to the Press Association, said: \u201cIt is correct that the helicopter returned to base on Tuesday 26 April. The pilot had a warning light and returned to Flesland according to procedure. \u201cAt Flesland the helicopter was inspected, according to procedure, and a part was replaced. \u201cWednesday, the helicopter was taken on a test flight, where the warning light reappeared, the helicopter returned to base, changed another component, the next test drive was completed without any warning light. \u201cThursday, the aircraft completed six commercial flights, all without any indication of problems. None of the changed parts were physically connected to rotor or gearbox.\u201d The statement added: \u201cThese returns to base are essential for flight safety and part of operating in a highly regulated industry. Sometimes an RTB can be for technical issues, other times it is much more mundane. \u201cAt all times, CHC has met or exceeded the requirements of our regulatory authorities and our customers, and continues to offer a compliant service. \u201cSpeculation about the cause of the accident is unhelpful and we must also be careful to respect the feelings of the families who perished in the tragic events of Bergen.\u201d Tributes have been paid to Stuart, who was a member of Brechin golf club, where a flag flew at half mast on Saturday. Stephen Rennie, the resident golf professional and manager, told the Mail on Sunday: \u201cThe whole club is shocked and saddened to hear the devastating news about Iain. He was a very popular member of the club and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time.\u201d A family friend, Charles Aitken, 75, said: \u201cMy daughter knows his wife, Amy. They are a really lovely family \u2013 it\u2019s an absolute tragedy.\u201d In tributes posted on social media, Stuart was described as \u201calways a gent\u201d and \u201ca top bloke\u201d. Field operators Statoil said the pilots of the helicopter \u2013 a Norwegian and an Italian \u2013 were CHC Helicopter staff. Ten of the passengers were Norwegian nationals and were employed by companies including Schlumberger, Aker Solutions, and Statoil. Their names have not yet been released. Emergency crews pulled the wrecked fuselage out of the sea on Saturday. A team from the UK\u2019s Air Accidents Investigation Branch has gone to the site. On Saturday, the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, tweeted about the \u201chorrifying reports\u201d and sthat she was being kept informed about the rescue work. She said her thoughts went out to all those who had lost a loved one. All UK commercial passenger flights using the same Airbus EC225LP Super Puma model have been grounded by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), mirroring action taken by its Norwegian counterpart. BP and Statoil have also suspended the use of the aircraft model after the accident, so it is unable to carry oil and gas workers, the BBC reported. EC225 Super Puma helicopters were previously grounded for a period in the UK after two crashes in Scotland in 2012. Both incidents, in which all passengers and crew were rescued, were blamed on gearbox problems. More than 6,500 people have now signed an online petition calling on the CAA to permanently remove the EC225 from service. They include Audrey Wood, who lost her son Stuart when a helicopter carrying workers from a BP oil platform crashed off Peterhead in Aberdeenshire in April 2009.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Read Daniel Taylor\u2019s match report: Bye! Right, that\u2019s all from me. Leicester deserved their draw, last-gasp penalty appeal aside (Sky\u2019s experts unanimously say it should have been a penalty, I refuse to believe that the contact Depay felt was sufficient to cause him to fall, and thus think he should have been booked for diving), but must wait at least until tomorrow before sealing the title. Their players will watch the Chelsea v Tottenham game together somewhere. Their manager will ignore the Chelsea v Tottenham game in an aeroplane somewhere. Wherever they are, they are 4-9 to win the title tomorrow night. Now see what happens when Manchester City play Southampton here: United started very very well, moved the ball very well, and it was very difficult for us to restart and make something good. After our goal I think we played better, and there were chances for them and us. I think the draw was the right result. I was worried because we have very good heart, and I thought, OK, sooner or later we react. After their goal I thought, we have to react immediately, and fortunately at the first free kick we scored a goal. Without Jamie away it\u2019s more difficult for us, because we are used to playing the ball for Jamie, and the opponent is always scared of the ball for Jamie. It was difficult for us to play because they press very very well. I saw Fellaini kick Huth, and it wasn\u2019t a good show for him. When you play against big champions, always must be very concentrated, because they can invent. You can do everything right but they can invent something special. For us, it was important to show our character, our mentality. The beginning wasn\u2019t good, but after I very appreciate our performance. We suffer all the matches because we know what we are. We know every match we have to work hard. I\u2019d like to watch the match tomorrow, but I think I\u2019m on a flight back from Italy so it\u2019s difficult for me to watch the match. Maybe I\u2019ll find out when I land. Look, for us it\u2019s important to continue to dream, continue to work, and then if there will be the Tottenham victory, do you know, three matches ago I said, in my mind Tottenham will win all the matches. Here\u2019s your match report. It\u2019s a bit of a little, tokenistic match report at the moment, but Daniel Taylor\u2019s full-on big \u2018un will replace it any minute now: Sky\u2019s cameras caught a nice exchange between the managers at the final whistle. Ranieri says to Van Gaal: \u201cYou\u2019re doing a fantastic job.\u201d The Dutchman respons: \u201cI am.\u201d Wes Morgan, the official man of the match, speaks to Sky: It was very tough. Man U dominated possession today and we had to really dig in, be resilient and do a lot of defending today. But it\u2019s a point, and a step in the right direction. It proved to be an important goal again. I don\u2019t score many, so to score at Old Trafford, was a great feeling. I thought I had the better of my marker today, any ball that was near me I felt I could at least get a touch on it. Maybe I could have had a second but I don\u2019t want to get too greedy. It\u2019s not ours until we\u2019ve got both hands on the trophy. We\u2019ll be watching tomorrow night and hopefully it\u2019ll be our day. And so does Danny Simpson, who insists he shouldn\u2019t have got sent off in that first-half incident involving Jesse Lingard, but admits he was a bit worried for a minute: It\u2019s Man Utd at the end of the day and it\u2019s Old Trafford and we knew it was going to be tough. We dug deep, done what we done all season and showed our character. It would have been nice to win it here but it\u2019s a good point. We\u2019ll see what happens tomorrow and keep going. Tomorrow I think we\u2019ll try to get together as a team. We\u2019ll see what the manager decides. We\u2019ve still got two games left. We\u2019re getting there. But were Chelsea not negative after January last season, as they crawled to the title with a succession of 1-0, 1-1 or 0-0 results? Leicester haven\u2019t been at their best for weeks, and are Leicester, yet they\u2019re still getting better results than anyone else. Only the most miserable of curmudgeons would criticise them, surely. And anyway, bland? So, Tottenham must win every remaining game, and even then Leicester must win only one of theirs, or draw them both. United stand four points and a massively inferior goal difference from the top four, with three to play. 90+5 mins: It\u2019s all over! Leicester have not won the league \u2026 yet! 90+4 mins: Ulloa is fouled by Blind, near the centre circle, and Leicester will surely see the game out now. 90+4 mins: United pass the ball around a bit, but when they work it into the area Simpson boots clear. 90+2 mins: A lovely ball from Herrera plays in Martial down the right. Fuchs tackles, but sends the ball rolling into his own area, with Mata rushing towards it! Schmeichel, though, streaks from his goal, and gets there first! 90+1 mins: There will be at least four minutes of time added on for stoppages. Can 10-man Leicester hold out \u2026 or better? 89 mins: I think that Depay should really have been told to get up there and stop whingeing, but it couldn\u2019t possibly have been a free kick \u2013 it was a penalty or nothing at all. 89 mins: Rooney shoots, and Schmeichel punches clear! 88 mins: Mata and Rooney stand over the free-kick, just outside the area on the left \u2026 88 mins: Mahrez goes off, and King comes on. 87 mins: Depay is played into the area. Drinkwater touches him on the shoulder a couple of times, and the Dutchman goes over. The referee, though, gives a free kick on the edge of the area, and a second yellow card for Drinkwater. That was very much more a touch than a pull-back, and would have been a horribly weak penalty. 86 mins: The away side just can\u2019t keep the ball. Drinkwater tries to find Mahrez, who knows he\u2019s offside so lets the ball roll past him. Schmeichel the hits an unchallenged clearance straight out of play. 83 mins: Leicester dominated the first half-hour of this second half, but United have controlled the last five and nerves are all a-jangle. 82 mins: Rashford goes off, and Depay and his mysterious Instagram account come on. 81 mins: United attack, and Valencia\u2019s cross from the right is perfect for Fellaini, who sadly is no longer on the pitch, and it flicks off the top of Mata\u2019s head and wide. 80 mins: United cross from the left, but Mata\u2019s touch takes it away from Rashford. Leicester break, Mahrez crosses and Ulloa chests down and volleys, badly, into the air. 78 mins: Chance for United! Smalling\u2019s header clips the base of the post and goes wide! 78 mins: Not only did Leicester name the same starting XI as for their last game, they named the same substitutes, and have even made the same substitutions: Gray for Okazaki, Albrighton for Schlupp. We just need King to come on for Ulloa to complete the set. 77 mins: Now United attack. Martial zooms down the left and his low cross provokes a panicked leg-stick-out from a defender, but no own goal. Leicester bring Albrighton on for Schlupp. 76 mins: Leicester have been excellent this half, but haven\u2019t quite converted this into chances. Ulloa has won a lot of headers, but not produced a memorable effort on target. Still, potential. 74 mins: Fellaini wins another cross, from Rojo on the left, but he used his hand to control it and somebody spotted it. Leicester have a free kick and that will be his last touch \u2013 Ander Herrera comes on to replace him. 72 mins: Gray beats Rojo on the right wing with humiliating ease, but when he gets to the byline he picks out Carrick rather than Mahrez. 71 mins: Save! City break in numbers and find Mahrez, who cuts inside Rojo, cuts inside Carrick and cuts inside Blind, before shooting left-footed. De Gea pushes the ball clear. 70 mins: United get a corner, and once again Blind takes it and Fellaini wins it, but the header goes wide. 67 mins: Another booking, this time Rooney, for pulling down Mahrez. Okazaki, who a minute ago attempted a ludicrous over-the-shoulder volley from 20 yards that just hinted that it might have been heading to the top corner before smacking a defender in the face, goes off, with Demarai Gray coming on. 64 mins: Mahrez wins a free-kick on the right, Drinkwater sends it into the area and Ulloa heads a very smart chance \u2013 a third-chance, at best \u2013wide. 63 mins: Fuchs heads away a left-wing cross by United, despite pressure from Fellaini. The suddenly whistle-happy referee gives Leicester a free-kick. 62 mins: Juan Mata is on, replacing Jesse Lingard. 61 mins: A manic minute on Leicester\u2019s left, as the visitors miss several chances to clear, United steal the ball back, bustle their way into the area, and it all ends with Rooney shooting high from 20 yards. 58 mins: I don\u2019t know what was in the referee\u2019s half-time cup of tea, but he\u2019s scribbling in his book again, Drinkwater getting a yellow card for a simultaneous slight pull on and slight kick at Rashford. 57 mins: The second booking of the day, very much like the first, goes to a United player for bringing down Schlupp as Leicester tried to break. Carrick this time. 57 mins: Lingard has swapped flanks with Martial, and since moving to the left has had a decent right-foot shot saved. 55 mins: Another chance for Leicester! This time Schlupp gets down the left, with Okazaki to his right. A good cross would surely have brought a goal, but it\u2019s too close to De Gea, who catches. 54 mins: Ulloa\u2019s shot from the edge of the area is deflected wide, and they have another corner. They win this one too, though Ulloa\u2019s header would have gone wide had Martial, stationed on the far post, not booted clear. 53 mins: We have a yellow card, the first of the day, awarded to Lingard for taking out Schlupp. Leicester have started this second half extremely well. 51 mins: Chance! Simpson gets into the penalty area and tries to cross low to Okazaki, but the ball clips Carrick\u2019s calves and runs out of play. Then Ulloa heads over from the corner, another decent chance. 50 mins: More from King Power HQ in Bangkok, where they\u2019ve gone from peddling duty free food and alcohol to totally free food and alcohol. 48 mins: Martial finds space in the area, but his right-foot shot flies high. 47 mins: Leicester have the first half-chance of the second half, Morgan\u2019s header from a corner being pushed away from goal by De Gea. 46 mins: Leicester get the second half under way, and immediately boot the ball out of play on the left flank. The players are back out. Leicester have 45 minutes to win the title (well, to win it today). Can they? A brilliant start from Manchester United, who absolutely owned the first quarter-hour, but Leicester have settled since and had chances. I feel the referee, for all that he\u2019s kept himself out of the game wherever possible, could still be key \u2013 with Fellaini and Huth both on the pitch, every set piece is a penalty in waiting. \u201cI cannot understand what Marcos Rojo adds to this United team,\u201d writes Dan Schulwolf. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly not a bad player having started a World Cup and Copa America final for Argentina but he doesn\u2019t do anything particularly well either. He commits too many fouls and his lack of commitment defending set pieces has been utterly shocking for someone of his size.\u201d He\u2019s having a poor game, and Mahrez can exploit the weakness \u2013 and nearly has already. A wildly fast-paced and lavishly entertaining half comes to a conclusion, and it\u2019s still anyone\u2019s game. 45+1 mins: There will be only one minute of first-half stoppage time, and it starts with Lingard crossing into Schmeichel\u2019s midriff. 45 mins: Ulloa goes down twice in a minute, and doesn\u2019t get so much as a second glance from the referee on either occasion. Michael Oliver\u2019s doing well here, letting the game flow wherever possible. 43 mins: Another right-wing corner for United, but this time he doesn\u2019t clear the defender on the near post. This first half has been relentlessly action-packed. 42 mins: On Sky Alan Smith says he thinks Mahrez should have had a penalty back in the 39th. I still think he deliberately ran into Rojo, rather than towards the ball, and that the referee made the right call. 40 mins: Leicester attack again, and Drinkwater\u2019s shot is deflected wide. From the corner Morgan sends a completely free header \u2013 Rojo snoozing there \u2013 emphatically high. 39 mins: Save! And a penalty appeal! Schlupp\u2019s cross from the left was on its way in until De Gea pushed it away; Mahrez seized upon it, jinked a few times, played the ball to right right of Rojo and then ran right into him. The referee is properly unimpressed. 38 mins: Mahrez, back on the right now, crosses left-footed towards Ulloa, who needed to just tickle the ball on its way towards the far post, but instead blootered it high and wide. 36 mins: Another Blind corner from the right, and this time Fellaini does win the header, but it\u2019s a bit tame, and it bounces before Schmeichel catches. 34 mins: Fuchs arrives to challenge Lingard, long after the ball departed the scene. There\u2019s very little contact, though, so he just about avoids a yellow card. 33 mins: While this game\u2019s been in progress we\u2019ve launched a news story about Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s potential future employment in this very stadium. 31 mins: Now then! Simpson gives the ball away to Lingard on the halfway line and the two race after the loose ball, shoulder to shoulder, with the United player eventually falling moments before Schmeichel arrives to clear. The home fans scream for a red card, the referee waves play on! 30 mins: Mahrez finds Schlupp on the edge of United\u2019s area, but his first touch is poor and takes him wide, and his shot is blocked by Valencia. 28 mins: United continue to hog possession, winning another corner, from which they eventually have a cross headed clear, and play a through-ball out of play. 26 mins: Leicester do some formational rejiggery \u2013 Schlupp has switches wings and is on the right, Mahrez moves to the middle, and Okazaki is shunted leftwards. 25 mins: The busiest elbows in football have been in action again. 23 mins: Rooney\u2019s shot hits the wall. 22 mins: Drinkwater and Huth go for the same bouncing ball, 20 yards out, and combine both to win it and flatten the only United player in the area. Free kick. 21 mins: United win a corner, taken by Blind. Fellaini escapes his marker and the ball is on its way onto his forehead, inside the six-yard box, until Ulloa got a faint flick just ahead of him. 19 mins: Smalling\u2019s marking of Huth at that free-kick suggests there may be a few decent penalty claims today. Not so much shirt-pulling as attempted disrobement. 18 mins: Carrick crosses to Fellaini \u2013 beyond the far post again \u2013 but his knock-down is intercepted. An equaliser! Drinkwater takes a free kick, fairly central and about 40 yards out, and chips it into the penalty area. Morgan reaches it first, and heads across goal and in! 16 mins: It\u2019s telling that every United cross so far has been aimed beyond the far post, so evading Morgan and Huth, who are always stationed in front of goal, entirely. Leicester\u2019s narrow defence is being found wanting. 14 mins: Save! A left-wing cross finds Fellaini beyond the far post, he chests it down and passes inside to Lingard, and his low drive is kept out by Schmeichel. 12 mins: A chance for Leicester! Mahrez has the ball on the right side of the area and pings a cross to Ulloa at the near post. The ball came to him fast, but he diverts it vaguely \u2013 but not quite enough \u2013 goalwards, missing by a couple of feet. 10 mins: Leicester win a free-kick in United\u2019s half, from which Fuchs immediately hands possession back to the home side. Manchester United score, and it\u2019s been coming! Valencia overlaps down the left, with Fuchs having to deal with both him and Lingard, and crosses with the outside of his right foot to Martial, beyond the far post, who shoots low and hard under Schmeichel! 7 mins: Ulloa wins a free kick in his own half, from which Schmeichel immediately hands possession back to the home side. 5 mins: The first shot of the day flies off the right boot of Marcus Rashford, and straight into the flying Huth. 4 mins: Lingard angles a cross from the right towards, but over, Martial, who sets off in chase, slips over, gets up again and finally reaches it near the opposite edge of the pitch, whereupon he\u2019s immediately given offside. 3 mins: Two minutes played, and United have had the ball for pretty much all of it. A ball across the edge of the area just induced surprising amounts of panic, given that it was weak and not really to anyone, but it was cleared in the end. 1 min: They\u2019re off! United get us under way, and Huth\u2019s already had to head away a cross. I don\u2019t know how any Leicester player can exist without their head exploding. Now they\u2019ve got some football to concentrate on. Play imminent. The players are out, and Leicester\u2019s fans have gone a bit Portsmouth on us: Five minutes to kick off. History beckons. Leicester have one hand on the trophy. Here\u2019s a very rough mock-up of what we might soon see much more of. On the subject of bookmakers, here\u2019s some last-minute pre-match reading for you: On a points-per-game basis United have the best home record in the Premier League, where they have scored 23, conceded 7 (so a goal difference of +16) and won 11 out of 17, to take 37 points. Leicester have the best away record in the Premier League, where they have scored 31, conceded 16 (so a goal difference of +15) and won 11 out of 17, to take 37 points. Louis van Gaal has spoken to Sky: Undoubtedly, I think we have to win, and that is also a big pressure, because the last matches of Leicester City they don\u2019t lose so much, and still we have to beat them. It\u2019s not a question of [not wanting them to win the league at] our stadium, it\u2019s a question that we want to qualify ourselves. But we are also strong at home, we have proven that this season again. So we have to beat them, and that\u2019s our aim. Arsenal and West Ham put pressure on us [by winning] and that\u2019s logical, and that\u2019s why we have to beat \u2013 I say it for the third time I believe \u2013 Leicester City. It is for sure that now we have less injuries, that I can choose more freely and I have more options. Every game is a different game and I look at what we need to beat Leicester City. George Meikle emails on the subject of that blue-battered sausage, noting it bears a \u201cvery unpleasant resemblance to a deceased Smurf on Viking Smurf funeral pyre\u201d. \u201cKing Power have organised a big show for the game at their headquarters in Bangkok for several hundred supporters in blue shirts,\u201d explains Oliver Holmes. \u201cEveryone here is enjoying free prawns and beer in the 31C heat while they wait for the game, which will be played on a huge screen.\u201d Memphis Depay has done some strange social media stuff. He\u2019s still following the main Manchester United Instagram account, but now has only one Instagram post to his name. Claudio Ranieri has spoken to Sky. Business as usual, he says: I\u2019m awaiting a very, very good match today. I ask them just the same performance, what we are used to do. I don\u2019t want to change our mind. Before the result, our performance is important. To show our strength. I\u2019m very curious to see my players, if they feel something different. I hope no, but it\u2019s important to check. The mood is OK, they enjoy, they are OK. But one thing what you show before a match, another thing what you show during the match. The story is fantastic. We achieved a lot, but not the big goal. Oliver Holmes, the Guardian\u2019s man in Bangkok, is outside the King Power HQ, where anticipation is building: There\u2019s a queue, an actual queue, to get into the O\u2019Neill\u2019s pub in Leicester and watch this game. Here, watch the Mahrez interview for yourself, and see if you agree with Sky\u2019s definition of \u201camusing moment\u201d. I\u2019d just like to say that there can be no possible justification for this. None. I mean, we\u2019re all excited about Leicester, but still. Not one: A couple of not-enormously revelatory player interviews from Sky. Riyad Mahrez says this: We need to perform today. The mood\u2019s the same. We just have to focus on our team and we\u2019ll see what we can do today. Wayne Rooney says this: We\u2019re fighting to try and get in the top four. It\u2019s a big game for us. We have to focus on ourselves and get the three points. That\u2019s one change for United from the team that beat Everton, Antonio Valencia coming in and Tim Fosu-Mensah dropping to the bench. Leicester keep faith with the team that walloped Swansea 4-0. The teams! The team sheets have been handed in, and these were the names upon them: Man Utd: De Gea, Valencia, Smalling, Blind, Rojo, Carrick, Fellaini, Lingard, Rooney, Martial, Rashford. Subs: Depay, Mata, Romero, Ander Herrera, Schneiderlin, Darmian, Fosu-Mensah. Leicester: Schmeichel, Simpson, Morgan, Huth, Fuchs, Mahrez, Kant\u00e9, Drinkwater, Schlupp, Okazaki, Ulloa. Subs: King, Albrighton, Amartey, Gray, Wasilewski, Chilwell, Schwarzer. Referee: Michael Oliver. Say what you like about Claudio Ranieri, he\u2019s got some excellent facial expressions. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a manager to touch him on the facial-expressions scale. An update from Ladbrokes, who now have 22 punters still holding wagers at 5000-1 on Leicester to win the league, the largest with a \u00a320 stake: Two nervous Leicester City fans have cashed out 5000/1 title bets just hours before the decisive Manchester United match. The fans were both in line for \u00a35000 from their \u00a31 wagers placed at the start of the season, but took early settlements of \u00a34381, cashing out via mobile app from a pub in Leicester city centre. They have arrived. Swansea are 2-0 up against Liverpool, Jack Cork having just scored the second. William Hill took 25 bets on Leicester to win the league at 5000-1, the smallest of 5p, placed by a female customer in Edinburgh, and the largest of \u00a320, which will net a customer from Manchester \u00a3100,000 if the title heads to the King Power Stadium. They will pay out \u00a33m if Leicester win the league, and estimate the industry-wide loss at \u00a310m (though presumably more than that was waged on Chelsea, Arsenal or the Manchester clubs, and they\u2019ll probably be OK). The Premier League has been won at Old Trafford on four occasions, three times by Manchester United (who have also won the title 10 times at other venues, or as a result of other teams\u2019 results) and once, in 2002, by Arsenal. While we\u2019re reading about teams that aren\u2019t Leicester \u2013 and there\u2019ll be time for reading about them \u2013 this is a wonderful and evocative piece of writing. In case you\u2019re wondering, there\u2019ll be no trophy presentations this afternoon: Leicester will be handed the Premier League pot at the end of their one remaining home game, against Everton next week, if they\u2019ve wrapped it up by then. Hello world! And so, the time has come. Leicester could be league champions today. All they must do is beat a team to whom they have been obviously and demonstrably superior for the entire season. And what better way to get the day started than with a little reading about \u2026 Ipswich! Alf Ramsey\u2019s success with Ipswich, who won the league on this weekend in 1962 when their only remaining opponents failed to beat Chelsea, and having been promoted the previous season, is pretty much the only modern achievement to bear comparison to this Leicester side (Preston also won the First Division title at the first attempt, though that was in 1889). Some bits of this article could be copy-and-pasted straight into an analysis of the Foxes\u2019 success this year, starting with the intro: In the long drawn out battle of the First Division it was Ipswich who gave a special character to the season. To the end they remained a fascinating enigma with no one outside Suffolk quite able to believe in or explain their persistent success. Or, for that matter: When Ipswich, with their players on \u00a325 per week could, by their greater team spirit and enthusiasm, defeat the sides full of stars paid three or four times as much, who could maintain that higher pay had made better players? But though Ipswich have had their fun this season they surely cannot undermine the natural order of things for ever. Or can they? Anyway, read, enjoy, sit down and get ready for what could prove a historic few hours \u2026",

Leicester deserved their draw, last-gasp penalty appeal aside (Sky\u2019s experts unanimously say it should have been a penalty, I refuse to believe that the contact Depay felt was sufficient to cause him to fall, and thus think he should have been booked for diving), but must wait at least until tomorrow before sealing the title. Their players will watch the Chelsea v Tottenham game together somewhere. Their manager will ignore the Chelsea v Tottenham game in an aeroplane somewhere. Wherever they are, they are 4-9 to win the title tomorrow night. Now see what happens when Manchester City play Southampton here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/01/southampton-v-manchester-city-premier-league-live\">Southampton v Manchester City: Premier League \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57261c90e4b0a2f120514c55\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-01T15:15:31.526Z\">4.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>United started very very well, moved the ball very well, and it was very difficult for us to restart and make something good. After our goal I think we played better, and there were chances for them and us. I think the draw was the right result.</p> <p>I was worried because we have very good heart, and I thought, OK, sooner or later we react. After their goal I thought, we have to react immediately, and fortunately at the first free kick we scored a goal.</p> <p>Without Jamie away it\u2019s more difficult for us, because we are used to playing the ball for Jamie, and the opponent is always scared of the ball for Jamie. It was difficult for us to play because they press very very well.</p> <p>I saw Fellaini kick Huth, and it wasn\u2019t a good show for him. When you play against big champions, always must be very concentrated, because they can invent. You can do everything right but they can invent something special. </p> <p>For us, it was important to show our character, our mentality. The beginning wasn\u2019t good, but after I very appreciate our performance. We suffer all the matches because we know what we are. We know every match we have to work hard.</p> <p>I\u2019d like to watch the match tomorrow, but I think I\u2019m on a flight back from Italy so it\u2019s difficult for me to watch the match. Maybe I\u2019ll find out when I land. Look, for us it\u2019s important to continue to dream, continue to work, and then if there will be the Tottenham victory, do you know, three matches ago I said, in my mind Tottenham will win all the matches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77e34d8e7f13af9959396fef09f1c90f993882c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77e34d8e7f13af9959396fef09f1c90f993882c3/759_244_4451_2670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester United v Leicester CityLeicester fans with one of their heroes.

Some bits of this article could be copy-and-pasted straight into an analysis of the Foxes\u2019 success this year, starting with the intro:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the long drawn out battle of the First Division it was Ipswich who gave a special character to the season. To the end they remained a fascinating enigma with no one outside Suffolk quite able to believe in or explain their persistent success.</p> </blockquote> <p>Or, for that matter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When Ipswich, with their players on \u00a325 per week could, by their greater team spirit and enthusiasm, defeat the sides full of stars paid three or four times as much, who could maintain that higher pay had made better players? But though Ipswich have had their fun this season they surely cannot undermine the natural order of things for ever. Or can they?</p> </blockquote> <p>Anyway, read, enjoy, sit down and get ready for what could prove a historic few hours \u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52a6d2e372610a29e7503e6b1e2ea7437fa67a91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52a6d2e372610a29e7503e6b1e2ea7437fa67a91/0_0_1002_1373/730.jpg\" alt=\"A report on Ipswich\u2019s league victory in 1962\" width=\"730\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A report on Ipswich\u2019s league victory in 1962</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-01T11:02:41.295Z\">at 12.02pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Michael Heseltine, a former deputy prime minister, has claimed Conservative ministers and MPs campaigning to leave the EU are \u201cturning on the policies\u201d that got them elected in 2015. Pointing to similarities between the infighting under John Major in the 1990s and the party\u2019s split before the 23 June referendum, the Tory peer said he found the actions of Brexit campaigners within the party \u201cmind-blowing\u201d. Lord Heseltine\u2019s remarks came as Conservatives on both sides of the debate insisted there was no imminent threat to David Cameron\u2019s leadership if the vote went against the remain camp. However, the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, predicted Cameron would have to quit, echoing Kenneth Clarke, a pro-Europe former cabinet minister, who made the same warning last month. Heseltine\u2019s intervention came as an Opinium/Observer opinion poll on voting intentions suggested an extremely close result. Appearing on the Murnaghan show on Sky News on Sunday, Heseltine said: \u201cI know that this government is in power because David Cameron is more popular than the Conservative party. I don\u2019t like saying that particularly because I don\u2019t want to have a personality cult. \u201cBut I know that the facts are that he won this election for the Conservatives and now to see people who, frankly, many of them would not have their seats and certainly many of them wouldn\u2019t be in government if David Cameron hadn\u2019t won that election for the Conservatives, to see them now turning on the policies that some of them have been sitting in the government implementing I just find mind-blowing.\u201d Farage, meanwhile, told The Andrew Marr Show on the BBC that if voters chose to leave the EU \u201cwe have to make sure that a British government carries out the will of the people\u201d. He said: \u201cI have seen referendums all over Europe where the people\u2019s voice has been ignored. \u201cSo Ukip being strong and making sure that the government and the prime minister \u2013 which won\u2019t be David Cameron in my view, but whoever it is \u2013 making sure they do go for article 50 of the [EU] treaty and start the process of political divorce.\u201d Former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles, who is pro-EU, and George Eustice, the food and farming minister who wants the UK to leave, told Pienaar\u2019s Politics on BBC\u2019s Radio 5 Live that there was no imminent threat to Cameron if the vote went against EU membership. Pickles said: \u201cI think David Cameron is a fantastic prime minister. I want him to stay on as long as he wishes to do, and no I don\u2019t think he\u2019d have to resign.\u201d He said it would take an enormous effort for the party to get opposing sides working together\u201d again but was confident this would happen. Pickles said he would be \u201cfirst to extend the hand of friendship\u201d to those who wanted to leave. Asked whether Cameron would have to find senior government posts for prominent out campaigners such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson if voters chose to remain in the EU, Pickles replied: \u201cI certainly feel that both Boris and Michael are people of enormous talent and I hope that they have senior positions in the cabinet, but I would not be so presumptuous as to name a particular post.\u201d Pickles insisted he would not watch a pre-referendum live TV debate between Cameron and Iain Duncan-Smith, a prominent leave campaigner, who quit the cabinet in March over benefit cuts. \u201cI think I would probably be watching a box set of Game of Thrones while that is on,\u201d he said. Eustice said Conservative MPs on both sides would reconcile themselves to whatever decision emerged from the referendum. He added: \u201cThe parliamentary party will get back together, heal itself. The truth is David Cameron has already made clear he doesn\u2019t intend to fight another election. He has made it clear he is going to stand down before the general election. I don\u2019t think anyone is going to be in any rush to move against him, whatever the outcome would be.\u201d The parliamentary party was very different from that of the 90s, Eustice said, adding: \u201cIf it is a vote to leave, he is going to need people like me to try to help him negotiate those terms for leaving. If it is a vote to stay, I will help him put the party back together. I have been very clear about that, and so have all the other ministers who are campaigning \u2026 to leave.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Leicester City\u2019s draw with Manchester United puts Premier League title on hold", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Leicester City have come so far on this once-in-a-lifetime odyssey they probably should not mind too much if the coronation has to be put off a little. Claudio Ranieri\u2019s team did not quite have the chutzpah to confirm themselves as implausible, eccentric champions at the home of England\u2019s most successful club but they walked off the pitch to a remarkable ovation and this could still be a valuable point, ultimately, given its implications at the top of the table. Their disappointment was obvious after the final whistle when Manchester United\u2019s fans clapped them all the way to the tunnel and the body language of Ranieri\u2019s players made it clear how much this tough, obdurate team had wanted to avoid delaying the process. It spoke volumes for the ambitions of these players but, in simple terms, they had still put themselves in a new position of strength given that Tottenham Hotspur now have to win all their remaining three fixtures to stand any chance. Leicester\u2019s lead is eight points and, even if Spurs keep up the chase by beating Chelsea on Monday, the leaders can make it arithmetically certain with a solitary win, or even two draws, from their home game against Everton on Saturday and their own trip to Stamford Bridge the following weekend. Their goal difference is inferior to that of the team in second but, in reality, it would take something extraordinary for Leicester to surrender their advantage, especially when they will have Jamie Vardy back from suspension for their last two fixtures. Ranieri\u2019s men might have swatted Swansea aside without their leading scorer last weekend but they felt his absence here during the passages of play, particularly in the second half, when they stretched United\u2019s defence without having the killer instinct inside the penalty area. The downside for Ranieri\u2019s men is that another of their key players will be suspended for the Everton game because of Danny Drinkwater\u2019s sending-off against the club where his career started. Drinkwater\u2019s tug on Memphis Depay, having already been booked, earned him a second yellow card and Leicester were fortunate the punishment was not more grievous. Depay\u2019s foot was on the line of the penalty area but the referee, Michael Oliver, decided it warranted only a free-kick and Leicester were spared the possibility of a late defeat. Leicester had looked increasingly dangerous during the second half, with Riyad Mahrez prominently involved, but the champions-in-waiting have certainly played better during other parts of their run-in and in the opening 45 minutes their use of the ball must have been slightly bewildering for the global television audience. Perhaps it was just inevitable their quick counter-attacking would not carry the same menace without Vardy and it was certainly a difficult first half for the league leaders, with Anthony Martial giving United an eighth-minute lead and the home side moving the ball far more purposefully than the crowd at Old Trafford have seen for most of the season. Louis van Gaal described it as \u201cone of our best matches this season\u201d and, even if he was exaggerating at times, talking about their opening 35 minutes being \u201cunbelievably good,\u201d it says a lot about Leicester that they refused to crumple. Van Gaal\u2019s top-spin did not really fool anyone but United were the better side in the opening half. Both teams had chances to win it after the interval and both had grievances with Oliver\u2019s refereeing on a day when Mahrez might also have won a penalty and Marouane Fellaini reminded us of his apparent inability to go through a football match without swinging his elbows into an opponent. On this occasion he connected with Robert Huth\u2019s windpipe, followed by a secondary swipe at Leicester\u2019s centre-half. Van Gaal argued that Huth had grabbed Fellaini\u2019s considerable hair and claimed it ought to have been a penalty but the Football Association\u2019s disciplinary department will surely take action. Fellaini is a serial offender and faces a ban that will rule him out of United\u2019s last three league games. As for Mahrez, perhaps there was a suspicion in Oliver\u2019s mind that the newly crowned player of the year had thrown himself into Marcos Rojo, rather than the other way around, but the defender can consider that 39th-minute incident a let-off during an afternoon when Leicester seemed to have identified him as a possible weak point. Wes Morgan\u2019s equaliser stemmed from him outmuscling Rojo to head in Drinkwater\u2019s free-kick and there were at least two other set pieces when Leicester\u2019s captain eluded him again. United will wonder whether it might have been a more profitable day, as they try to clamber into the Champions League qualifying places, if it had not been for Kasper Schmeichel\u2019s one-handed save to keep out Jesse Lingard, with the score at 1-0. They were dominant at that point and their supporters will also think back to that moment, just after the half-hour, when Lingard ran clear after Danny Simpson\u2019s mistake before going to the floor under the defender\u2019s challenge. On this occasion the referee was probably right to give Simpson the benefit of the doubt, with the home crowd baying for a red card, but Leicester looked unusually hesitant during that period when Lingard combined with the overlapping Antonio Valencia to set up the opening goal. Valencia\u2019s cross off the outside of his right boot caught the Leicester defence static and Martial took advantage of some lax marking to rifle in his 15th goal of the season. However much Van Gaal tried to dress it up, Leicester looked the more rounded team for a 20-minute spell at the start of the second half when, attacking on the break, they started finding the space to get behind the home team\u2019s defence. What they could not do was find the decisive goal but the late penalty decision went their way and Ranieri still left the impression that his flight to Italy, for lunch with his 96-year-old mother, would be a happy one.

      "body": "<p>Leicester City have come so far on this once-in-a-lifetime odyssey they probably should not mind too much if the coronation has to be put off a little. Claudio Ranieri\u2019s team did not quite have the chutzpah to confirm themselves as implausible, eccentric champions at the home of England\u2019s most successful club but they walked off the pitch to a remarkable ovation and this could still be a valuable point, ultimately, given its implications at the top of the table.</p> <p>Their disappointment was obvious after the final whistle when Manchester United\u2019s fans clapped them all the way to the tunnel and the body language of Ranieri\u2019s players made it clear how much this tough, obdurate team had wanted to avoid delaying the process. It spoke volumes for the ambitions of these players but, in simple terms, they had still put themselves in a new position of strength given that Tottenham Hotspur now have to win all their remaining three fixtures to stand any chance.</p> <p>Leicester\u2019s lead is eight points and, even if Spurs keep up the chase by beating Chelsea on Monday, the leaders can make it arithmetically certain with a solitary win, or even two draws, from their home game against Everton on Saturday and their own trip to Stamford Bridge the following weekend.</p> <p>Their goal difference is inferior to that of the team in second but, in reality, it would take something extraordinary for Leicester to surrender their advantage, especially when they will have Jamie Vardy back from suspension for their last two fixtures. Ranieri\u2019s men might have swatted Swansea aside without their leading scorer last weekend but they felt his absence here during the passages of play, particularly in the second half, when they stretched United\u2019s defence without having the killer instinct inside the penalty area.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/01/manchester-united-v-leicester-premier-league-live\">Manchester United v Leicester City: Premier League \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The downside for Ranieri\u2019s men is that another of their key players will be suspended for the Everton game because of Danny Drinkwater\u2019s sending-off against the club where his career started. Drinkwater\u2019s tug on Memphis Depay, having already been booked, earned him a second yellow card and Leicester were fortunate the punishment was not more grievous. Depay\u2019s foot was on the line of the penalty area but the referee, Michael Oliver, decided it warranted only a free-kick and Leicester were spared the possibility of a late defeat.</p> <p>Leicester had looked increasingly dangerous during the second half, with Riyad Mahrez prominently involved, but the champions-in-waiting have certainly played better during other parts of their run-in and in the opening 45 minutes their use of the ball must have been slightly bewildering for the global television audience.</p> <p>Perhaps it was just inevitable their quick counter-attacking would not carry the same menace without Vardy and it was certainly a difficult first half for the league leaders, with Anthony Martial giving United an eighth-minute lead and the home side moving the ball far more purposefully than the crowd at Old Trafford have seen for most of the season. Louis van Gaal described it as \u201cone of our best matches this season\u201d and, even if he was exaggerating at times, talking about their opening 35 minutes being \u201cunbelievably good,\u201d it says a lot about Leicester that they refused to crumple. Van Gaal\u2019s top-spin did not really fool anyone but United were the better side in the opening half.</p> <p>Both teams had chances to win it after the interval and both had grievances with Oliver\u2019s refereeing on a day when Mahrez might also have won a penalty and Marouane Fellaini reminded us of his apparent inability to go through a football match without swinging his elbows into an opponent.</p> <p>On this occasion he connected with Robert Huth\u2019s windpipe, followed by a secondary swipe at Leicester\u2019s centre-half. Van Gaal argued that Huth had grabbed Fellaini\u2019s considerable hair and claimed it ought to have been a penalty but the Football Association\u2019s disciplinary department will surely take action. Fellaini is a serial offender and faces a ban that will rule him out of United\u2019s last three league games.</p> <p>As for Mahrez, perhaps there was a suspicion in Oliver\u2019s mind that the newly crowned player of the year had thrown himself into Marcos Rojo, rather than the other way around, but the defender can consider that 39th-minute incident a let-off during an afternoon when Leicester seemed to have identified him as a possible weak point.

      "bodyText": "The most obvious move for Luke Walton must befuddle so many. After his run last fall as the temporary head coach of the greatest regular season team in NBA history, Luke Walton was going to get head coaching of his own this spring. He had his pick of almost any opening. And all the other options \u2013 even the Knicks \u2013 offered less dysfunction than the only job he wanted. The Los Angeles Lakers. In returning to the Lakers, with whom he played the first eight and a half years of his career, Walton inherits any number of calamities that could ruin a coach. His point guard just turned 20 and occasionally acts half that age. His two other potential build-around players are barely older and still flawed. The team has no leaders. The club president who hired him may leave in a year, meaning the general manager could be gone too. And the former coach, winner of five Laker titles, looms on the horizon as the new executive ready to wrap his cherished triangle offense around Walton\u2019s neck. The Lakers are the least-stable, least-sane, least-manageable of Walton\u2019s options. The chance is much greater that he becomes Randy Pfund than Pat Riley. As a franchise the Lakers are like an expensive sports car, so complicated to drive that only two giant personalities \u2013 Riley and Phil Jackson \u2013 have kept them from crashing into the guardrails. And it took rosters filled with the 15 greatest players in history to keep that from happening. Riley started with Magic and Kareem. Jackson began with Kobe and Shaq. Walton gets the kid who videotaped a team-mate nicknamed Swaggy P talking about cheating on his fianc\u00e9e. The worst of the Clippers never seemed as bad as these Lakers. The team Walton takes over is nothing like the Warriors, who are one of the most cohesive, unselfish teams the NBA has ever seen. Any reasonable person would stay far away from the Lakers But Walton also played on Lakers teams that won championships. And because of this he understands a truth that made his choice simple. There is nothing better anywhere in sports than to be a Laker when the Lakers are winning. And the coach who brings the winning back to LA, whether next year or in 10 years, will be rewarded with eternal love in a city where popularity runs as far as your last Golden Globe. Having been handed the chance to try for history it would be foolish for Walton to say no. He may have had choices this spring but he really had no choice. The Lakers who were last season\u2019s disaster won\u2019t be around next fall. That tumble to the bottom of the standings existed to support Kobe Bryant\u2019s long farewell. Walton gives the Lakers a respectable face to send out in free agency. He will be able to lure better players to Los Angeles even if they don\u2019t include Kevin Durant, who would bring instant credibility. And the Lakers could still win the draft lottery and land Ben Simmons or Duke\u2019s Brandon Ingram, giving them yet another young star to build upon. While the Lakers might not be great next year they won\u2019t be as terrible as they were in the season just gone. Walton is the perfect coach to build them back. He brings positive experience from Golden State, whose success and popularity is the envy of almost every NBA team. More importantly, he brings an ability to relate to players that many gifted coaches do not possess. Last December, Walton\u2019s friend Josh Pastner, now the coach at Georgia Tech, talked to The Guardian about the first time Walton coached \u2013 as a volunteer assistant for Pastner at the University of Memphis during the 2011 NBA lockout. Walton, he said, had a natural gift to communicate, something that is essential in professional basketball. \u201cThere are two things he does,\u201d Pastner said then. \u201cHe\u2019s got a great knowledge of the game and that\u2019s important because players know when you know what you are talking about or not. But he\u2019s also got a great temperament He doesn\u2019t get too high or two low. He\u2019s got a competitive desire to him but he keeps it very calm and relaxed.\u201d The coach who rebuilds the Lakers will need an abundance of patience. Someone is going to have to get D\u2019Angelo Russell to play together with team-mates and keep Julius Randle\u2019s development going. Walton brings the voice that might just be able to do that. And if he can, if he create Showtime again then he will be the rarest of stars in the city of stars. The one that everybody loves. How could he not take a chance at being that?",

    "sectionName": "Opinion", 
    "webTitle": "Boris Johnson \u2013 the mayor who never was | Sonia Purnell", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "By Saturday morning Boris Johnson will officially have ceased to be mayor of London. There are many \u2013 including not a few within and around City Hall itself \u2013 who believe that Johnson vacated that post in all but name long ago. Arguably he has never been a fully committed London mayor at all. Things began badly. Shortly after the 2008 election that propelled him to the mayoralty, his nonchalant approach prompted his then chief of staff to back him into a dark corner of a London restaurant, to demand that he \u201cget a grip\u201d and \u201cstart being mayor!\u201d. And by the time he was seeking re-election in 2012 (with nothing better having come up), Johnson was already privately confessing that he was bored with running a capital city of 8.3 million people. In the 12 months since he became an MP at last year\u2019s general election \u2013 in anticipation of being crowned the new Tory leader \u2013 the malaise has worsened. He has all but given up even pretending to be a hands-on mayor. Johnson was elected as part of a grand design to bring progress and dynamism to the capital city \u2013 and that matters not just to London itself, but also to the rest of the country, which benefits from the capital\u2019s performance as the engine of the UK economy. But the engine, as powered by Johnson, merely stutters: when it fires at all. Insiders complain of a drift that has reduced the misshapen fastness of City Hall to a \u201czombie\u201d administration. What work is done is the achievement of Eddie Lister, the hugely overworked chief of staff and deputy mayor. This is not to be confused with light-touch stewardship or the mayor as an artful, watchful chair supervising an able chief executive. This is Johnson as elected bystander. Even prominent Tories such as Steve Norris, the former transport minister \u2013 who twice lost mayoral elections to Ken Livingstone \u2013 now openly brand Johnson a \u201cdisappointment\u201d. Livingstone, once the ultimate Tory hate figure and a man mired again in public controversy following last week\u2019s suspension from the Labour party, has glaring and manifest faults. But many Tories, with heavy hearts, now conclude that he was a \u201cbetter mayor\u201d. For bystanding has its cost. To stand still is to move backwards. A mayor administrates not just for now, but for the challenges 10 years hence. But London has been neglected, left in the lurch by a leader who has been too busy earning half a million pounds a year through columns and books \u2013 too busy selling Brand Boris across the world \u2013 to tackle its urgent and worsening problems such as housing, pollution and congestion. The result has been an obvious and undesirable blow to the status and aspiration of London\u2019s mayoralty \u2013 arguably the third most important and exciting political job in the country, and surely one of the most prestigious in the world. And we see consequences in the uninspiring and sometimes unpleasant contest between Labour\u2019s Sadiq Kahn and the Tory Zac Goldsmith. Both seem underpowered as leaders, without the vision or stature one would hope for. But that is hardly surprising, as the example offered by Johnson over the past eight years was hardly likely to attract first-rank candidates. Labour\u2019s Khan at least seems to genuinely want the job; but many Tories fear that in Goldsmith they have been saddled with another Etonian who is really not that bothered. There is no proof of competence, let alone vision. The truth is that London\u2019s City Hall is no longer taken seriously. It seems unable to attract the equivalent of the big beasts of New York, those with the celebrated managerial qualities of Mayor Bloomberg, the crisis leadership skills of Rudy Giuliani, or the radical chutzpah of Bill de Blasio. Their styles and politics are very different, but their commitment to their city has been unwavering. They are held to a higher standard. It is virtually impossible to imagine New Yorkers putting up with their mayor embarking on a distant vacation without a reliable phone signal, as Johnson did in the Rockies in 2011. It is even more incredible that they would re-elect someone who refused to return immediately from his luxury Winnebago when streets in his city were burning in the worst riots for a generation. But Londoners did just that. Johnson was giving so little, but people in the capital seemed to be expecting even less. Perhaps they had simply become accustomed to inaction from the man dubbed the \u201cdo nothing mayor\u201d. The capital must ask itself what it wants from its mayor and the \u00a3150m-a-year machinery that supports him, and supposedly keeps him in check. It is time to demand more for our money and, taking into account what we have learned from the past eight years, to put the mayor under proper scrutiny. We might then ask: was it enough for Johnson to dad-dance for the cameras and whip up the crowd at the Olympics while failing to address a housing crisis that threatens London\u2019s very lifeblood, or to significantly reduce the air pollution that kills thousands, cocking a snook at the environmental bodies that have been urging him to do something meaningful? Was it acceptable for him to be running demanding parallel careers as writer, journalist and MP when London is facing an imminent terrorist threat, without \u2013 as many say \u2013 sufficient plans in place to cope? Was it credible that the mayor of a city that takes pride in and relies upon its diversity \u2013 a mayor with a legal responsibility to \u201cpromote good relations between persons of different racial groups and religious beliefs ... and treat people with respect\u201d \u2013 should attack the first black president of the United States for being, in Johnson\u2019s dog-whistle phrase, \u201cpart Kenyan\u201d? And should the mayor of London really have been spending a large proportion of his (or is that our) time spearheading the Brexit campaign (and his own personal bid to become PM) when his city and the businesses based here largely want to remain in the EU? If he succeeds in persuading Brits to vote out on 23 June, his successor will have been in post just seven weeks before dealing with the inevitable turbulence, a fact already causing pandemonium among City Hall\u2019s thinkers. Johnson\u2019s only lasting legacy to London may well be years of post-Brexit economic and social storms. London is a success story, in world and national terms, but this is despite and not because of Johnson\u2019s inattention. Livingstone, flawed as he was and is, laid some outstanding foundations as mayor: starting Crossrail; helping to capture the Olympics; and modernising the buses and tubes. Johnson was fortunate to inherit the good work of his predecessor and even luckier that a pliant media \u2013 veering between idolatry and lack of interest in holding him to account \u2013 has largely ignored his conspicuous lack of achievement. Londoners may now react to this sorry history by failing to vote on Thursday for his successor, by not turning out; but that would be a pity and counter-productive, for if Johnson has taught us anything it is that this time we really need a mayor who puts the city\u2019s interests first. This is no job for someone who doesn\u2019t really want it and does it half-heartedly. We know what that looks like after the past eight long years.",

Shortly after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/may/02/london08.london\">2008 election</a> that propelled him to the mayoralty, his nonchalant approach prompted his then chief of staff to back him into a dark corner of a London restaurant, to demand that he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/18/boris-johnson-biography-tory-threats\">\u201cget a grip\u201d and \u201cstart being mayor!\u201d.</a> And by the time he was seeking re-election in 2012 (with nothing better having come up), Johnson was already privately confessing that he was bored with running a capital city of 8.3 million people.</p> <p>In the 12 months since he became an MP at last year\u2019s general election \u2013 in anticipation of being crowned the new Tory leader \u2013 the malaise has worsened. He has all but given up even pretending to be a hands-on mayor. Johnson was elected as part of a grand design to bring progress and dynamism to the capital city \u2013 and that matters not just to London itself, but also to the rest of the country, which benefits from the capital\u2019s performance as the engine of the UK economy. But the engine, as powered by Johnson, merely stutters: when it fires at all.</p> <p>Insiders complain of a drift that has reduced the misshapen fastness of City Hall to a \u201czombie\u201d administration. What work is done is the achievement of <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/boris-johnson-appoints-new-chief-of-staff-after-aides-death-6393517.html\">Eddie Lister, the hugely overworked chief of staff and deputy mayor</a>. This is not to be confused with light-touch stewardship or the mayor as an artful, watchful chair supervising an able chief executive. This is Johnson as elected bystander. Even prominent Tories such as Steve Norris, the former transport minister \u2013 who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/apr/05/conservatives.uk1\">twice lost mayoral elections to Ken Livingstone</a> \u2013 now openly brand Johnson a \u201cdisappointment\u201d. Livingstone, once the ultimate Tory hate figure and a man mired again in public controversy following last week\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/28/ken-livingstone-suspended-from-labour-after-hitler-remarks\">suspension from the Labour party</a>, has glaring and manifest faults. But many Tories, with heavy hearts, now conclude that he was a \u201cbetter mayor\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5a9ecb5bf85d18bbec97d6dc0e39daae593a87c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5a9ecb5bf85d18bbec97d6dc0e39daae593a87c/0_136_4080_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson on zipwire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018London has been left in the lurch by a leader who has been too busy selling Brand Boris across the world.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For bystanding has its cost. To stand still is to move backwards. A mayor administrates not just for now, but for the challenges 10 years hence. But London has been neglected, left in the lurch by a leader who has been too busy earning half a million pounds a year through columns and books \u2013 too busy selling Brand Boris across the world \u2013 to tackle its urgent and worsening problems such as housing, pollution and congestion. The result has been an obvious and undesirable blow to the status and aspiration of London\u2019s mayoralty \u2013 arguably the third most important and exciting political job in the country, and surely one of the most prestigious in the world.</p> <p>And we see consequences in the uninspiring and sometimes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/15/london-mayoral-race-zac-goldsmith-accused-of-playing-with-fire\">unpleasant contest between Labour\u2019s Sadiq Kahn and the Tory Zac Goldsmith</a>. Both seem underpowered as leaders, without the vision or stature one would hope for. But that is hardly surprising, as the example offered by Johnson over the past eight years was hardly likely to attract first-rank candidates. Labour\u2019s Khan at least seems to genuinely want the job; but many Tories fear that in Goldsmith they have been saddled with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/19/zac-goldsmith-london-mayor-etonian-tory\">another Etonian</a> who is really not that bothered. There is no proof of competence, let alone vision.</p> <p>The truth is that London\u2019s City Hall is no longer taken seriously. It seems unable to attract the equivalent of the big beasts of New York, those with the celebrated managerial qualities of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/16/michael-bloomberg-president-silicon-valley-2016-election\">Mayor Bloomberg</a>, the crisis leadership skills of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/16/september11.usa1\">Rudy Giuliani</a>, or the radical chutzpah of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/21/bill-de-blasio-uber-new-york-city-proposed-ban\">Bill de Blasio.</a> Their styles and politics are very different, but their commitment to their city has been unwavering. They are held to a higher standard. It is virtually impossible to imagine New Yorkers putting up with their mayor embarking on a distant vacation without a reliable phone signal, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/aug/09/boris-johnson-katrina-moment-holiday\">Johnson did in the Rockies in 2011</a>.

      "bodyText": "As a former headteacher, Jo Scrimgeour is the last person who would normally let her children skip school. On Tuesday, however, she plans to do just that, joining a small but vocal band of parents in England who plan to boycott the nationwide key stage exams. The aim is to protest against the government\u2019s more onerous assessment regime for primary school pupils. The Department for Education (DfE)says its new requirements promote rigour and effective learning, but thousands of parents \u2013 including Scrimgeour \u2013 strongly disagree. \u201cBecause I\u2019m an ex-teacher and an ex-headteacher, and with two boys at primary school, I\u2019ve seen both sides of what these tests are doing,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the new curriculum, there\u2019s been an enormous narrowing. This year, schools are having to spend huge amounts of time on spelling, punctuation and grammar particularly. There just isn\u2019t time for all sorts of other things. \u201cMy son, in year one, is coming home with spelling lists and is only doing PE once a week, but when I started teaching it was very different.\u201d On Tuesday, instead of sitting the tests, Scrimgeour\u2019s sons will go to the woods in Truro, Cornwall, with a group of other pupils and their parents. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want my sons to be doing, playing in the mud and finding mini-beasts, not underlining adverbs,\u201d she said. The protest was inspired by the new national curriculum for key stage one: years one and two of primary school, from ages five to seven; and key stage two, the final four years which ends with pupils aged 11. Introduced in 2015, the revised curriculum is more demanding in English and maths as part of the government\u2019s drive to add rigour. Six and seven-year-olds now need to memorise five and 10 times tables, as well as use fractions. The move was coupled with more demanding forms of assessments that come into force this year, including a spelling and grammar test for year two pupils. The more challenging regime followed the government\u2019s decision to scrap the old style of measuring attainment known as national levels. That left schools lacking familiar benchmarks while having to adopt the new assessments, and made them more nervous thanks to the DfE\u2019s hesitant and in some cases inept supply of materials. Nadya Smith, whose youngest children have key stage one and two assessments at their school in Southwark, London, says the stakes are so much higher than when her eldest son took his key stage two standardised tests (Sats) five years ago. \u201cIt has changed so much,\u201d Smith said. \u201cNow there\u2019s all this ceaseless energy being spent that does nothing to help children learn.\u201d Smith learned about the school boycott via friends on Facebook, and got involved because of the effect she can see the tests having. \u201cMy son, who is 11, came home and said to me: \u2018What happens to me if I do badly in my Sats?\u2019 I thought that was such a terrible statement to come from an 11-year-old. A child that age doesn\u2019t have the comprehension to deal with it.\u201d In Hastings, Amy Hemmings says she is taking her six-year-old out of school on Tuesday, along with about 30 other parents who plan to meet in a local park. \u201cChildren are missing out on quite a range of activities and projects so they can do more maths and spelling and grammar. That\u2019s my main concern,\u201d she said. Visits to the library have been pushed into pupils\u2019 lunchtime, while time spent on music lessons and sport has been cut back. \u201cThey have to take time out of their free time to do those other things that ideally would be part of the school day. It\u2019s really sad to me. The amount of free play they get now is close to zero,\u201d Hemmings said. She also heard about the boycott on Facebook, where the idea of a protest seems to have originated via a page named Let Kids Be Kids. The group behind the original page say they have recorded at least 270 events supporting the boycott across the country, but many are small in scale. The original organisers wish to remain anonymous. \u201cWe decided at the beginning that if we did this we would keep ourselves anonymous, so that the focus was on the national level, not on any one particular area,\u201d a woman said to be one of the organisers told the Guardian. Tuesday\u2019s boycott is unlikely to hit the heights seen during the 2010 boycott over primary school testing. Then, backed by the major teaching unions and national publicity, about one in four pupils did not sit key stage two tests, according to official data. This year\u2019s protest has enjoyed some backing, with the author Philip Pullman among those signing a letter of support published in Saturday\u2019s Guardian. It also has at least tacit support from the likes of the National Association of Head Teachers. \u201cWe can\u2019t condone an absence just because a parent doesn\u2019t like what is going on in a class that day. But I understand what the parents are doing or asking to do. That\u2019s a matter of individual choice for them,\u201d said Tony Draper, the NAHT\u2019s former president and head of a primary in Milton Keynes. Speaking to headteachers on Saturday, the education secretary, Nicky Morgan, said it was damaging for children to take part in the boycott. \u201cKeeping children home even for a day undermines their education,\u201d she said. \u201cI urge those running these campaigns to reconsider their actions.\u201d According to Min Clough, whose two children attend a primary school near Ipswich, the point of the boycott is protest, not disruption. She said: \u201cAs parents we\u2019re not being listened to, and teachers aren\u2019t being listened to. I feel Nicky Morgan is pushing through her agenda and not listening to teachers and people with academic expertise, who see that this sort of 19th-century testing isn\u2019t effective. \u201cNone of us are sure what this is for, we can\u2019t see the benefits of it. All we can see is that it is making our children stressed.\u201d Clough says about a third of parents at her children\u2019s small Suffolk primary are likely to take part, and Smith is hopeful of similar support in Southwark. In Truro, Scrimgeour is not expecting a large turnout. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people umming and ahhing,\u201d she said. She has, however, heard of larger demonstrations in Falmouth and other gatherings around Cornwall. \u201cAt the school we\u2019re at there isn\u2019t massive support for the strike, but I haven\u2019t met anybody who doesn\u2019t agree with the aims.\u201d",

That left schools lacking familiar benchmarks while having to adopt the new assessments, and made them more nervous thanks to the DfE\u2019s hesitant and in some cases inept supply of materials.</p> <p>Nadya Smith, whose youngest children have key stage one and two assessments at their school in Southwark, London, says the stakes are so much higher than when her eldest son took his key stage two standardised tests (Sats) five years ago.</p> <p>\u201cIt has changed so much,\u201d Smith said. \u201cNow there\u2019s all this ceaseless energy being spent that does nothing to help children learn.\u201d</p> <p>Smith learned about the school boycott via friends on Facebook, and got involved because of the effect she can see the tests having. \u201cMy son, who is 11, came home and said to me: \u2018What happens to me if I do badly in my Sats?\u2019 I thought that was such a terrible statement to come from an 11-year-old. A child that age doesn\u2019t have the comprehension to deal with it.\u201d</p> <p>In Hastings, Amy Hemmings says she is taking her six-year-old out of school on Tuesday, along with about 30 other parents who plan to meet in a local park.</p> <p>\u201cChildren are missing out on quite a range of activities and projects so they can do more maths and spelling and grammar. That\u2019s my main concern,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Visits to the library have been pushed into pupils\u2019 lunchtime, while time spent on music lessons and sport has been cut back.</p> <p>\u201cThey have to take time out of their free time to do those other things that ideally would be part of the school day. It\u2019s really sad to me. The amount of free play they get now is close to zero,\u201d Hemmings said.</p> <p>She also heard about the boycott on Facebook, where the idea of a protest seems to have originated via a page named Let Kids Be Kids.</p> <p>The group behind the original page say they have recorded at least 270 events supporting the boycott across the country, but many are small in scale. The original organisers wish to remain anonymous.</p> <p>\u201cWe decided at the beginning that if we did this we would keep ourselves anonymous, so that the focus was on the national level, not on any one particular area,\u201d a woman said to be one of the organisers told the Guardian.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s boycott is unlikely to hit the heights seen during the 2010 boycott over primary school testing. Then, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/mar/26/education-unions-exams\">backed by the major teaching unions</a> and national publicity, about <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-curriculum-assessments-at-key-stage-2-england-academic-year-2009-to-2010-revised\">one in four pupils</a> did not sit key stage two tests, according to official data.</p> <p>This year\u2019s protest has enjoyed some backing, with the author <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/29/sats-have-troubled-englands-children-for-too-long-they-must-go\">Philip Pullman among those signing</a> a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/29/more-than-30000-people-sign-petition-to-boycott-year-2-sats\">letter of support published in Saturday\u2019s Guardian</a>. It also has at least tacit support from the likes of the National Association of Head Teachers.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t condone an absence just because a parent doesn\u2019t like what is going on in a class that day. But I understand what the parents are doing or asking to do. That\u2019s a matter of individual choice for them,\u201d said Tony Draper, the NAHT\u2019s former president and head of a primary in Milton Keynes.</p> <p>Speaking to headteachers on Saturday, the education secretary, Nicky Morgan, said it was damaging for children to take part in the boycott.</p> <p>\u201cKeeping children home even for a day undermines their education,\u201d she said. \u201cI urge those running these campaigns to reconsider their actions.\u201d</p> <p>According to Min Clough, whose two children attend a primary school near Ipswich, the point of the boycott is protest, not disruption.</p> <p>She said: \u201cAs parents we\u2019re not being listened to, and teachers aren\u2019t being listened to. I feel Nicky Morgan is pushing through her agenda and not listening to teachers and people with academic expertise, who see that this sort of 19th-century testing isn\u2019t effective.</p> <p>\u201cNone of us are sure what this is for, we can\u2019t see the benefits of it. All we can see is that it is making our children stressed.\u201d</p> <p>Clough says about a third of parents at her children\u2019s small Suffolk primary are likely to take part, and Smith is hopeful of similar support in Southwark.</p> <p>In Truro, Scrimgeour is not expecting a large turnout. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people umming and ahhing,\u201d she said. She has, however, heard of larger demonstrations in Falmouth and other gatherings around Cornwall. \u201cAt the school we\u2019re at there isn\u2019t massive support for the strike, but I haven\u2019t met anybody who doesn\u2019t agree with the aims.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "The New York state Libertarian party convention was held in New York City on Saturday. It started at 10am. It grew lively at noon, the hour John McAfee showed up. The anti-virus software mogul and one-time international fugitive had turned into a presidential hopeful, and he arrived at the convention dressed like an ageing rocker: blond streaks in his hair, aviator sunglasses hooked into the neck of his white T-shirt and a flamboyant paisley scarf draped around his neck. McAfee, who infamously went on the run from Belize police in 2012 after being named as a \u201cperson of interest\u201d in a murder case, would later tell the Guardian he never went out at night for fear that the government of Belize might try to \u201cwhack\u201d him. That threat aside, the 70-year-old seemed to be enjoying himself as he overshadowed the rest of Libertarian party nominees at the convention in the East Village. He was in the city to debate his fellow hopefuls, including the party\u2019s 2012 candidate, Gary Johnson. Johnson achieved the party\u2019s best-ever election result last time round, winning 1.2m votes \u2013 0.99% of the vote nationally. He\u2019s a popular man. But there was no doubting who was the star on Saturday. Rather than immediately enter the convention \u2013 held in the back room of the restaurant \u2013 McAfee posted up outside, having his photograph taken with Libertarians and passersby, smoking cigarettes and acting up for the four-person film crew he had arrived with. He is being filmed for a series on Spy TV, and he seemed to be enjoying the attention. He chatted into the camera, he laughed into the camera, he came up close to the lens and stuck his tongue out at the camera. It was all well and good until the camerawoman misjudged one of McAfee\u2019s playful lunges and smacked him in the mouth with the camera lens. The 70-year-old checked his teeth in the window of a nearby swimwear store. No permanent damage. McAfee was best known for his eponymous software until 2012, when he went on the run from Belize. Police had wanted to question him in relation to the death of a neighbor, but were never able to, as McAfee made it back to the US. Four years after the incident, even in the middle of a presidential campaign, he is adamant that there is a constant threat to his life. \u201cThe government of Belize I shamed, I humiliated, I cost them a ton of money in terms of tourist travel,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want me to shut the fuck up about this, which I will not do and I have not. So if you think a corrupt government run by the Sinaloa cartel is not willing to whack an American citizen, then you need to bone up on the Sinaloa cartel.\u201d McAfee said he did not feel under threat during the conversation \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s daytime; there\u2019s a lot of people around. No one\u2019s going to do anything\u201d \u2013 but said he never felt safe. \u201cI don\u2019t go out at night,\u201d he said. \u201cEver. Anywhere.\u201d McAfee argued that he should be president because only he has the skills to address the problem of internet security. He referred to \u201cthe imminent collapse of our nation due to the fact that we are 20 years behind much of the rest of the world in cybersecurity.\u201d \u201cI will win,\u201d McAfee added. \u201cI would win the general election. Because I know who I am, I know my talents, and I know what my limits are. And I\u2019ve been around long enough to know people\u2019s minds.\u201d McAfee began his debate performance with an unorthodox opening statement: \u201cI don\u2019t have a statement prepared.\u201d \u201cI am unprepared for everything, always,\u201d he added, \u201cso I\u2019m not going to waste your time.\u201d He sat back down. He had used 30 seconds of his allotted two minutes. The others had prepared. Johnson, a two-term governor of New Mexico and seemingly the best qualified to be the 2016 nominee, set out his plan for what the Libertarian party needed to do to move beyond the role of quirky outsider: join presidential debates. \u201cIf you\u2019re not in the presidential debates, you\u2019re not going to win. It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Johnson told the Guardian. In 2000, the commission on presidential debates decided that a party or candidate would only be allowed to participate if they received 15% support or more across five national polls. Johnson and the Libertarian party have only crossed that threshold in one poll so far. \u201cA month ago, I was in my first and only national poll, and I was at 11% against Trump and Clinton,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIf my name were in the polls, given the polarizing nature of this race, I will be at 15%, which will get me into the debates.\u201d To that end, he has pressed polling firms to include him in more surveys. He has also filed a lawsuit, along with the Green party, against the commission on presidential debates. Johnson also expressed, with frustration, his belief that \u201cmost people\u201d are libertarian but just don\u2019t know it. During the debate and in conversation, he repeatedly referred to the website isidewith.com, which asks users to take a quiz to find out which presidential candidates they are most aligned with. \u201cIf everybody would take that quiz [to] find out who you align with, I think most people will be libertarian,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best sales tool I can think of, and what I tell people is: \u2018Take the quiz\u2019.\u201d Johnson has taken the quiz. \u201cOutside of the other Libertarians running for president, the next presidential candidate that I most align with is Bernie Sanders, at 73% [aligned]. Which I found to be really revealing. \u201cOn the social side, marriage equality, marijuana legalization, crony capitalism, military interventions, we\u2019re on the same page.\u201d After the debate, Johnson and others hung around to chat and shake hands. But McAfee had had enough. He jumped up and marched out, his film crew scurrying behind him. He seemed to have lost some of his rock star pizzazz. \u201cI\u2019m 70 years old, and I\u2019ve been talking all day.\u201d Asked what he thought of the debate, he said: \u201cIt was boring, as all debates are, and utter nonsense. He said he planned \u201cto rest as much as possible\u201d before the party\u2019s national convention at the end of May in Orlando, Florida. Then he returned to his hotel, camera crew in tow, presumably not to emerge until the next break of day.",

The hope is that the swift death has minimized the release of lactic acid, which degrades the flesh meat and reduces the crew\u2019s chances of earning a grade-A for this fish once it is offloaded back at port in Koror, Palau, a small island nation in the Pacific Ocean. He quickly eviscerates the taut, silvery fish, pulling out an assembly of organs that look like something from another planet. He removes the heart and stomach \u2013 the scavenged parts that will likely go into tonight\u2019s crew dinner \u2013 and tosses the rest of the guts overboard before flushing the carcass with running water, sewing up its gaping mouth, and placing it into the icy waters of the boat\u2019s cold storage tank. If the buyers back in Koror, who inspect and score the quality of each tuna\u2019s meat, give it a high grade, this particular tuna could net around $2,800 wholesale in Japan, where it will be resold at great profit in a sushi restaurant. It all looks like a typical day of tuna wrangling on the high seas, except that it\u2019s not. Aboard are Lotus Vermeer, who manages the Pacific tuna program for The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a US-based environmental organization. Also aboard are Michael Musyl, principal scientist of the Pelagic Research Group in Hawaii and a shark expert, and Ivan Sesebo, a tuna fishery observer, who works for an auditor hired by the boat\u2019s owner, Hong Kong-based Luen Thai Fishing Ventures, to ensure compliance with fishing regulations. This trio is executing an experiment, funded by TNC\u2019s Indo-Pacific Tuna Program, to test whether changing the designs of the hooks and other fishing practices could reduce the amount of bycatch \u2013 species that are unintentionally caught and often include sharks, turtles, reef fish and other threatened or endangered species \u2013 without also reducing the tuna catch, thereby keeping the business financially lucrative for fishing companies. While many US fisheries have enacted rules meant to limit bycatch, what happens in Palau and other rich fishing grounds has a close connection to the diet of many Americans, because the US imports nearly 90% of seafood consumed. A radical approach Bycatch takes a financial toll on fishermen. Unwanted fish take up hooks on lines and require crew to spend time hauling and safely releasing the catch. Some fishermen keep bycatch illegally, cutting off fins to sell on the lucrative black market for shark fin soup. Some bycatch doesn\u2019t survive, and its absence could upset the balance of a marine ecosystem already under threat from climate change and pollution. However, asking commercial fishermen to experiment with new equipment, which may prove ineffective and costly, requires strong incentives. TNC got creative to get itself onto an actual tuna boat, bopping along five degrees north of the equator and 133 degrees east of the prime meridian, in waters that the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) estimates generates 60% of the world\u2019s tuna catch that amounts to a $7bn annual market. Working with Palau\u2019s government, TNC purchased the fishing rights and offered them to Shen Lain Cheng in return for an opportunity to carry out Vermeer\u2019s experiment. They also tag sharks and other bycatch to track their movement after being released to see if they survive. TNC declined to say what it paid for the rights, which typically run between $20,000-$25,000. The overall cost of the project, including the rights and $250,000 worth of equipment to tag fish and transmit data, is $1.5m. Mark Zimring, co-director of TNC\u2019s Indo-Pacific Tuna Program, says purchasing fishing rights for the Shen Lain Cheng was \u201cin some sense a radical approach\u201d, but that in the absence of many industry- or regulatory-led efforts on reducing bycatch, it\u2019s one that is worth trying. The project also provides good training for crews working for Luen Thai. In 2013, authorities nabbed a Luen Thai boat off the Marshall Islands for having approximately 50 shark fins. The company was fined $120,000 and the offending boat was destroyed. Luen Thai\u2019s vice president Derrick Wang says the company has not had any finning violations since that incident, and that Luen Thai has instituted a number of policies, including unannounced boat inspections and a penalty scheme for captains and crew if they are found to have any shark products. The penalties can be as high as $20,000 for an offending boat. Hooked on an idea Studies have shown that switching from the traditional J-shaped hook to a circular hook, or using fish bait instead of squid bait, can reduce the likelihood of catching non-target species on tuna boats. \u201cTurtles tend to get hooked less often when the bait is a fish, which falls apart as they gum it, whereas with squid they have to chomp the whole thing,\u201d Vermeer explains. \u201cAnd if it does get hooked, the types of hooks we\u2019re using, called circle hooks, tend to hook in the mouth, whereas an older type of hooks called J-hooks tend to hook turtles deeper, in the esophagus, which is associated with higher mortality.\u201d Research has so far failed to reveal a silver bullet combination that can minimize bycatch for any species. Until now, there have not been any trials designed to tease out the optimal type of hook and bait that would reduce bycatch of the most vulnerable species without also reducing a boat\u2019s tuna haul for a specific fishery in a specific part of the ocean. Luen Thai, like many boats fishing for sushi-grade tuna, uses the longline fishing technique, in which thousands of baited hooks are attached to a single, long line stretching up to 25 miles. The setup generates a significant amount of bycatch, though determining exactly how much is difficult for many reasons, including poor, incomplete or inaccurate reporting by many fisheries. Still, data collected by the United Nations Fisheries and Agriculture Department indicates that tuna longlining produces an amount of bycatch second only to shrimp trawling, while another fishing technique called purse seining \u2013 in which schools of small tuna species (mostly for canning) are scooped up in massive nets \u2013 generates far less bycatch than longlining. A recent study in the science journal Aquatic Conservation found that bycatch from tuna longline fishing in Palau accounts for a third of all hooked species, so the potential for improvement in this fishery is significant. Using circle hooks has also shown to reduce incidental hooking of stingrays. Other research has revealed that circle hooks and fish bait can actually lead to hooking more sharks. The truth is more complicated and nuanced, explains Eric Gilman, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University and a fishing industry consultant commissioned by TNC to help design the study on the circle hooks. Sharks migrate, so they reach certain age and size in different parts of the ocean, and those changes could make them more susceptible to being caught by circular hooks of particular sizes. From there, scientists will be able to study data showing the ages and migration patterns of sharks in different pockets of the western and central Pacific and determine which hook sizes are best to use (and those to avoid) throughout the year. For the bait experiment, the hook variability will be removed, and the type of bait will be alternated between squid and fish to examine the link between bait and bycatch. Layered onto this will be any findings that show correlations, if any, between hook size, bait size and tuna catch. Ultimately, what matters most in terms of the environmental impact of reeling in the wrong species is mortality. It\u2019s very difficult to know the fate of bycatch after they are sent back into the ocean. The third leg of TNC\u2019s experiment will involve tagging bycaught sharks to determine whether they live or die after being released. Shark hunting \u201cEveryone thinks longline tuna is very dirty fishery because of all the bycatch, and that is true,\u201d says Musyl, who has been brought on to lead the shark tagging. \u201cA lot of people assume that these sharks die after release, but we found the opposite. It looks like the majority of sharks that have been studied do survive.\u201d Although Musyl did acknowledge that some species, including thresher sharks, tend to die as a result of the stress of being caught. But the existing data has a significant gap: it is not from Palau\u2019s near-equatorial climes. \u201cThis work hasn\u2019t been done at this latitude [until now],\u201d says Musyl. \u201cAnd we know water temperature affects metabolism [and] physiology. [Warm water] exacerbates stress [and] reduces oxygen. It has a huge impact on the survival of animals.\u201d Sharks that are caught and released may have a good chance of survival in some parts of the world, but Musyl is not about to assume it will happen here. About an hour into the afternoon\u2019s longline haul, the crew pulls a new data point up from the depths: a six-foot, 45-lb female silky shark. Vermeer, Musyl and Sesebo grab the tagging gear and jump into position. The fishing crew helps to hold the shark as still as possible on the deck as Vermeer hoists up a long slender pole, with both hands and great care, and thrusts the thick, two-inch long needle at its tip into the shark\u2019s thick skin, at the base of its dorsal fin. She lifts the pole back up and Musyl checks that the tracking tag is properly embedded. Sesebo takes note of the color of a small ziptie near the hook, which indicates that this silky was hooked by the medium-sized hook. The crew then cuts the monofilament line close to the shark\u2019s mouth (a safer bet, for the fish and fishermen, than trying to remove the hook), and the silky swims back into to the big blue. The tag contains sensors that track temperature, depth and speed for 30 days. At that point, it self-ejects, floats to the surface and transmits the collected data over a satellite link to the researchers. If the shark stops moving for a long while or if it sinks below 5,577 feet, both of which indicate that the animal has died, the tag self-ejects prior to the 30-day mark. When researchers receive a tag\u2019s data before that time, they assume the shark has died. The researchers plan to tag 108 sharks during the course of the experiment. End-game The Palauan government has told TNC that if the hook-and-bait experiment illustrates a clear path to reducing bycatch, Palau could mandate the use of a specific size and shape hook, or outlaw baiting with squid. Meanwhile, Palau is also planning to curb fishing by creating a marine sanctuary in 80% of its offshore waters, a move to focus \u201con tourism, not tuna\u201d, according to the country\u2019s president. Still, Palau has influence in setting commercial fishing regulations in the WCPFC\u2019s custodial region \u2013 the world\u2019s largest tuna fishery, covering an astounding 20% of the globe\u2019s surface. A new fishing requirement from Palau would persuade many of the WCPFC\u2019s member countries and prompt them to adopt the same mandate, says Shelley Clarke, who researches bycatch rates for the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission. However, the cost-benefit analysis related to changing gear and bait would have to be made clear, she added. A single longliner sets up to 5,000 hooks in the water. At $2-$3 each, fishing companies would need to weigh the cost of converting to new hooks against the likelihood that the crew will bring in more bigeye or yellowfin tuna \u2013 or at least spend less time dealing with bycatch. Wang says that Luen Thai, which operates 82 longline tuna boats in the region and contracts with the crews of another about 30 boats, would likely convert to a specific hook size and bait type if the TNC experts could demonstrate that reducing bycatch won\u2019t also reduce the number of tuna longliners catch. The hook and bait experiment is only part of TNC\u2019s larger plan to reduce bycatch and stop illegal fishing. It\u2019s already planning a second set of experiments designed to record videos of all the fish caught on boats and use a yet-to-be-developed software that can quickly scan and pinpoint illegal catch. The goal is to significantly cut the monitoring and enforcement time for authorities, who would otherwise have to manually review the video recordings. Researchers of the project have been eagerly waiting for data from sharks tagged since last month. The tag that was attached to the female shark aboard the Shen Lain Cheng during the reporting of this story self-ejected on April 15, indicating that it survived. All told, 34 tags have resurfaced; 10 of those animals have likely perished based on when the data was received. It\u2019s too early, however, to discern which hook size pulls in the most sharks. And the final mortality rate will not be known, of course, until the experiment is complete and all tag data is received.

Meanwhile, Palau is also planning to curb fishing by creating a marine sanctuary in 80% of its offshore waters, a move to focus \u201con tourism, not tuna\u201d, according to the country\u2019s president. Still, Palau has influence in setting commercial fishing regulations in the WCPFC\u2019s custodial region \u2013 the world\u2019s largest tuna fishery, covering an astounding 20% of the globe\u2019s surface. A new fishing requirement from Palau would persuade many of the WCPFC\u2019s member countries and prompt them to adopt the same mandate, says Shelley Clarke, who researches bycatch rates for the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission.</p> <p>However, the cost-benefit analysis related to changing gear and bait would have to be made clear, she added. A single longliner sets up to 5,000 hooks in the water. At $2-$3 each, fishing companies would need to weigh the cost of converting to new hooks against the likelihood that the crew will bring in more bigeye or yellowfin tuna \u2013 or at least spend less time dealing with bycatch.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/apr/28/timberland-haiti-jeff-swartz-ikea-hm-fashion-sustainability-supply-chain-child-labor\">In Haiti, a project to help farmers inspires a sustainable cotton movement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wang says that Luen Thai, which operates 82 longline tuna boats in the region and contracts with the crews of another about 30 boats, would likely convert to a specific hook size and bait type if the TNC experts could demonstrate that reducing bycatch won\u2019t also reduce the number of tuna longliners catch.</p> <p>The hook and bait experiment is only part of TNC\u2019s larger plan to reduce bycatch and stop illegal fishing. It\u2019s already planning a second set of experiments designed to record videos of all the fish caught on boats and use a yet-to-be-developed software that can quickly scan and pinpoint illegal catch. The goal is to significantly cut the monitoring and enforcement time for authorities, who would otherwise have to manually review the video recordings.</p> <p>Researchers of the project have been eagerly waiting for data from sharks tagged since last month. The tag that was attached to the female shark aboard the Shen Lain Cheng during the reporting of this story self-ejected on April 15, indicating that it survived.

      "bodyText": "When Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade appeared online last weekend, many fans were furious that it was only available through one streaming service. They weren\u2019t going to sign up to a \u00a39.99-a-month plan just for a Beyonc\u00e9 album, they decided, and off they went in search of illegal downloads. When Drake\u2019s new album appeared as an exclusive on a different streaming service five days later, it happened again. For those of us who recall a time, not so long ago, when a single chart CD cost \u00a315.99, it is easy to mock the self-righteousness of supposed music fans who balk at spending \u00a39.99 a month for unlimited access to millions of songs. But it\u2019s no longer just one monthly payment. Exclusive content deals mean that to keep on top of things, UK music fans might need subscriptions to both Spotify and Apple Music. Maybe Deezer or Google Play seem a good bet. Then there\u2019s Soundcloud, when that goes premium, along with YouTube\u2019s new Red offering. Add this to subscriptions many also pay to Netflix, Sky or Amazon Video, plus myriad sports packages and the BBC licence fee, and entertainment looks pretty expensive. One of the noisiest companies trying to add to music fans\u2019 monthly bill is Tidal \u2013 home of that Beyonc\u00e9 stream \u2013 which Jay Z relaunched last March after buying it from its original Norwegian owners for $56m (\u00a338.3m). Tidal\u2019s livestreamed relaunch event was quite something, with 16 pop titans taking to the stage, where each signed a pledge. The big idea: unlike other services, Tidal would be owned by artists (it has been suggested that the artists on stage that day were each given 3% equity) and would pay all artists fairly. There were echoes of how United Artists attempted to change the Hollywood system almost a century earlier, though Charlie Chaplin didn\u2019t book Alicia Keys to quote Nietzsche. \u201cWe\u2019re gathered,\u201d Keys said at one point, \u201cwith one voice, in unity, in the hopes that today will be another one of&nbsp;those moments in time. A moment that will forever change the course of music history.\u201d Tidal was asking fans to form an emotional relationship with a streaming service. It is a standard trick in a crowded marketplace: if Compare the Market can use soft toys to conjure affection for car insurance, why can\u2019t Tidal wheel out Madonna as their own aristocratic meerkat? The launch event was panned. Fans&nbsp;and media did not embrace what they saw as millionaires getting even richer. Noel Gallagher asked: \u201cWho do these people think they are, the fucking Avengers?\u201d When Jay Z told Billboard \u201cpeople really feel like music&nbsp;is free, but will pay $6 for water\u201d, he was trying to make a point about how little people value art. Unfortunately, he made a different point: that he thinks normal people pay $6 for a bottle of water. Search Google for the words \u201cTidal\u201d and \u201cbotched\u201d and you\u2019ll get an idea not just of how many mistakes the company has made in the intervening 13 months, but of how gleefully Tidal\u2019s shortcomings have been reported around the world. It is an irresistible narrative: Jay Z, the consummate modern mogul, has made a mistake. Bloomberg Businessweek went with the headline \u201cThat\u2019s Business, Man: Why Jay Z\u2019s Tidal Is a Complete Disaster\u201d. Forbes had \u201cJay-Z\u2019s Tidal Is Tone Deaf And Won\u2019t Save the Music Industry\u201d. Stereogum opted for: \u201cBehold the Half-Assed Hubris of Tidal\u201d. It may be worth wondering why a streaming service that is home to some of the planet\u2019s most powerful black artists has come in for such huge push-back from some sections of the media, but it is also fair to say that Tidal\u2019s first year under Jay Z\u2019s control was not a total success. Its CEO, Andy Chen, left after three weeks; his interim replacement, Peter Tonstad, lasted three months. Drake, who had been mooted as a Tidal artist-owner, helped launch Apple Music instead, and his current exclusive with that service underlines his allegiance to it. In October, during an unrelated copyright infringement trial, Jay Z listed his numerous business interests. But he forgot one of his investments. \u201cYou have a music streaming service, don\u2019t you?\u201d he was asked. \u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d was the reply. \u201cForgot about that.\u201d At the end of last month, he launched a lawsuit against Tidal\u2019s former owners. Tidal has become a laughing stock. One major artist manager I speak to says that \u201cit stank from the very beginning\u201d, but is it really a bad service? It is precisely one year since Jay Z took the step of tweeting a lengthy defence of Tidal. \u201cWe are here for the long haul,\u201d he stated at one point. \u201cPlease give us a chance to grow and get better.\u201d Twelve months on, Tidal has indeed grown (it now boasts more than three million users) and it has got better. I mainly use Spotify and Apple Music \u2013 indeed I contribute playlists to Spotify and curate for Apple Music \u2013 but when I find myself on Tidal it does the job I need it to do. It has nearly doubled its available tracks, increased coverage from 31 countries to 46, and live-streamed shows including the third-season blowout for Kanye\u2019s Yeezy shoe and clothing line at Madison Square Gardens. Regardless of how well they have been rolled out, there have been big album exclusives from Kanye (The Life of Pablo hit 250m streams in 10 days), Rihanna (13m streams in 14 hours), and as of this weekend Beyonc\u00e9, whose Lemonade appeared without a hitch. Then there\u2019s Prince, who withdrew his catalogue from all streaming services except Tidal, and debuted the albums HitNRun and HitNRun Phase Two through it. Tidal wisely decided against trying to capitalise on Prince\u2019s death. Equally, though, striking a deal with a chap who was not easily persuaded when it came to allowing others to exploit his work must have paid dividends. If Tidal was good enough for Prince, maybe it should be good enough for the rest of us. Music Business Worldwide editor Tim Ingham, who has been closely following Tidal\u2019s ups and downs, reckons that it is wrong to totally write it off. \u201cTidal\u2019s not only showing rival services up with its exclusive content, but also the slickness of its presentation \u2013 which is undeniable,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you forget the circus surrounding its creation and management failings, Tidal, the product, is an excellent streaming service.\u201d Still, it has entered a crowded marketplace where companies are competing to stake a claim on streaming while the technology is still in its relative infancy (on-demand streaming doubled in the US in 2015, and increased by 82% in the UK). In a world where Spotify recently raised an extra \u00a31bn in funding, the $56m Jay Z paid for Tidal is loose change. \u201cEvery established, non-Apple/Google-owned player I can think of which hasn\u2019t gone bust yet is losing millions of dollars every month,\u201d Ingham argues. \u201cMusic streaming is an economically torturous game, and Tidal is the runt of the litter.\u201d Spotify currently has at least 30 million paying customers and another 70 million using its free tier. Apple Music stands at 13 million and Tidal at just three million. So if Tidal is the underdog, how come nobody\u2019s cheering the company on? Its pledge to pay more to artists is unequivocally a good thing, right? Unfortunately for Tidal, the backlash that followed Tidal\u2019s star-studded launch suggests potential users were so dazzled by Deadmau5\u2019s glistening helmet that they couldn\u2019t see the smaller artists who would also stand to benefit. Tidal\u2019s high-quality streams, meanwhile, have been popular with early adopters, but are of little interest to mass-market music fans. It is worth noting that Tidal\u2019s reliance on exclusive album streams from big-name acts can backfire. Take Kanye\u2019s The Life of Pablo, which debuted on Tidal. \u201cMy album will never never never be on Apple,\u201d he tweeted at the time. \u201cAnd it will never be for sale ... You can only get it on Tidal.\u201d The album is now on sale elsewhere, and streaming on all major services. One fan was so dismayed by this perceived betrayal that he filed a lawsuit against Kanye and Tidal, a response so melodramatic that even Kanye himself might grudgingly approve. Most fans won\u2019t sue Tidal, but after Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade appeared for sale on iTunes less than a day into Tidal\u2019s exclusive, it is easy to see how they might grow wary of signing up to any service just to hear one album. On Monday, Matthew Hussey, editor-in-chief of the technology website the Next Web, published an article titled \u201cWhy You Shouldn\u2019t Subscribe to Tidal, Even if You\u2019re a Beyonc\u00e9 Fan\u201d. \u201cOf course, there was nothing explicit in Tidal\u2019s promotion that said, \u2018No one else will have this\u2019,\u201d he tells me now. \u201cBut it must feel like a slap in the face to have signed up \u2013 you can\u2019t sign up without giving bank details \u2013 only to find another service has it.\u201d Restricting availability of music to one service \u2013 windowing \u2013 is one of the key ways streaming services can differentiate their offerings, and in business terms it makes sense. Apple Music has been doing this a lot, too. Windowing is also controversial, particularly with fans who resent having to maintain numerous active subscriptions in the hope that they will hear new releases. I approached Tidal for comment about this and other topics. The company did agree to answer questions over email, but sadly nothing turned up. Looking on the bright side, their responses will probably appear on Spotify in a week or two. Deezer is a streaming service that can boast of up to twice as many users as Tidal. While Tidal and Apple Music have thrown equity and money at exclusives, its approach has been similar to Spotify\u2019s. Christian Harris, Deezer\u2019s UK and Ireland MD, told me that this involves finding new ways to introduce users to the millions of songs in its catalogue, rather than making noise about a specific 12 new tracks. Last week, he had YouGov in the Deezer office. The organisation was doing research following Deezer\u2019s recent TV ad campaign \u2013 part of the company\u2019s attempt to take streaming to mainstream audiences. The results showed a bump for Tidal\u2019s brand recognition off the back of some of its exclusives. \u201cBut from what we can see there isn\u2019t the same result in terms of revenues,\u201d says Harris, \u201cand Tidal is still a minnow in the world of global music streaming. We don\u2019t regard them as serious competition. The odd exclusive makes for a nice soundbite, but it doesn\u2019t make for a complete service.\u201d I ask Harris if he has listened to the Beyonc\u00e9 album. He hasn\u2019t had a spare minute, he admits. \u201cIf I was going to, personally I\u2019d probably listen for free on Tidal on a trial account,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not so bothered about what Beyonc\u00e9 does or doesn\u2019t do on her husband\u2019s platform that I\u2019d rush to do it.\u201d Elsewhere, a music industry source intimately acquainted with the streaming world argues that windowing can actually be damaging to artists. \u201cLet\u2019s look at what happened with Kanye,\u201d they told me. \u201cHe windowed for two months. If you look at his public listener figures since Pablo went on Spotify, you can see he\u2019s had like a 50% jump, from around 15 million monthly listeners to around 22 million. Pablo only hit No 1 when it hit non-exclusive.\u201d As for Beyonc\u00e9? \u201cShe\u2019s No 1 on lots of charts. She\u2019s No 1 on The Pirate Bay, she\u2019s No 1 on KickAss Torrents \u2026\u201d While it\u2019s true that social media timelines are full of Beyonc\u00e9 fans grudgingly signing up to Tidal, it appears that exclusives are tempting others into piracy. One way to warn artists away from windowing might be for the biggest streaming services, such as Spotify, to pull down the shutters on artists who have windowed elsewhere. For them to say: \u201cActually, you know what, you\u2019ve got your lump sum of cash from Apple Music for keeping your album off our service for a week \u2013 we\u2019ll give it a miss thanks.\u201d Over at Spotify, Jonathan Prince, the company\u2019s global head of communications and public policy, does not think that is likely. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of getting offended,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t take it personally. We want all these people on the service because their fans want to listen to them, but we get that artists make decisions for all sorts of different reasons: business-related, philosophical, whatever. They\u2019re creating great work and they\u2019ve got a right to make their own decisions.\u201d And what of Tidal\u2019s claim to pay artists \u201cproperly\u201d, while other services allegedly do not? \u201cIn order to really understand the value being created, we need to move away from this antiquated notion of per stream or per listen,\u201d Prince begins. \u201cWe need to measure success based on the value of the consumer, not the value of the individual transaction. If a consumer\u2019s paying $120 a year to listen to music, that\u2019s much more than what the average consumer was worth at the height of the music industry. And it\u2019s why the industry is finally growing again.\u201d Rather more bluntly, he adds: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got one user listening to one song a month, you can say \u2018We pay $10 a stream\u2019, but you\u2019ve still only got one user, so it\u2019s like, big freaking deal.\u201d It may even be the case that being \u201cthe artist\u2019s friend\u201d is an unsustainable business model for Tidal. \u201cSo far,\u201d Tim Ingham points out, \u201cthe bigger independent streaming services get, the bigger their losses become. That gamble especially applies for any platform arbitrarily promising artists a higher royalty rate than Spotify, a company which has shattered its bottom line to pay music rights holders the most it possibly can.\u201d Perhaps, however, it was never the plan for Tidal to rival huge services such as Spotify. Maybe Jay Z really was incredibly naive when he thought a combination of star power and the tech world\u2019s equivalent of loose change would make a streaming service work. But does Jay Z strike you as a particularly naive guy? One line of thought is that he was playing a different game from the beginning. Ingham spells it out. \u201cJay Z is a thoroughbred businessman,\u201d he says. \u201cHe likes making money. You might have noticed he talks about it quite a lot. Tidal can\u2019t win the streaming wars, but it can cause a racket, get bought by a real player and ensure Jay Z and his fellow superstar shareholders are paid handsomely in the process. I suspect Tidal\u2019s celebrity harem have had this laid out for them: \u2018Back us, and when we sell, you\u2019ll get paid big.\u2019\u201d Matthew Hussey predicts Tidal will end up being bought out by Samsung, a company that has watched its closest rivals in the handset world \u2013 Apple and Android \u2013 build platforms and revenue streams with their own streaming services. Considering the media narrative on Tidal, this would be the ultimate plot twist. If Jay Z does, indeed, flip Tidal and make himself a billionaire in the process, Tidal could be the smartest financial move of his career.",

Unfortunately, he made a different point: that he thinks normal people pay $6 for a bottle of water.</p> <p>Search Google for the words \u201cTidal\u201d and \u201cbotched\u201d and you\u2019ll get an idea not just of how many mistakes the company has made in the intervening 13 months, but of how gleefully Tidal\u2019s shortcomings have been reported around the world. It is an irresistible narrative: Jay Z, the consummate modern mogul, has made a mistake. Bloomberg Businessweek went with the headline <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-05-28/why-jay-z-s-tidal-streaming-music-service-has-been-a-disaster\" title=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s Business, Man: Why Jay Z\u2019s Tidal Is a Complete Disaster\u201d</a>. Forbes had <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikemontgomery/2015/05/18/jay-zs-tidal-is-tone-deaf-and-wont-save-the-music-industry/#4fb3b74831e6\" title=\"\">\u201cJay-Z\u2019s Tidal Is Tone Deaf And Won\u2019t Save the Music Industry\u201d</a>. Stereogum opted for: <a href=\"http://www.stereogum.com/1790959/behold-the-half-assed-hubris-of-tidal/franchises/sounding-board/\" title=\"\">\u201cBehold the Half-Assed Hubris of Tidal\u201d</a>.</p> <p>It may be worth wondering why a streaming service that is home to some of the planet\u2019s most powerful black artists has come in for such huge push-back from some sections of the media, but it is also fair to say that Tidal\u2019s first year under Jay Z\u2019s control was not a total success.<strong> </strong>Its CEO, Andy Chen, left after three weeks; his interim replacement, Peter Tonstad, lasted three months.<strong> </strong>Drake, who had been mooted as a Tidal artist-owner, helped launch Apple Music instead, and his current exclusive with that service underlines his allegiance to it. In October, during an unrelated copyright infringement trial, Jay Z listed his numerous business interests. But he forgot one of his investments. \u201cYou have a music streaming service, don\u2019t you?\u201d he was asked. \u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d was the reply. \u201cForgot about that.\u201d At the end of last month, he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/31/jay-z-tidal-owners-schibsted-verdane\" title=\"\">launched a lawsuit against Tidal\u2019s former owners</a>.</p> <p>Tidal has become a laughing stock. One major artist manager I speak to says that \u201cit stank from the very beginning\u201d, but is it really a bad service? It is precisely one year since Jay Z took the step of tweeting a lengthy defence of Tidal. \u201cWe are here for the long haul,\u201d he stated at one point. \u201cPlease give us a chance to grow and get better.\u201d Twelve months on, Tidal has indeed grown (it now boasts more than three million users) and it has got better. I mainly use Spotify and Apple Music \u2013 indeed I contribute playlists to Spotify and curate for Apple Music \u2013 but when I find myself on Tidal it does the job I need it to do.</p> <p>It has nearly doubled its available tracks, increased coverage from 31 countries to 46, and live-streamed shows including the third-season <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/feb/12/kanye-west-releases-album-and-fashion-collection-at-madison-square-garden-video\" title=\"\">blowout for Kanye\u2019s Yeezy shoe and clothing line</a> at Madison Square Gardens. Regardless of how well they have been rolled out, there have been big album exclusives from Kanye (The Life of Pablo hit 250m streams in 10 days), Rihanna (13m streams in 14 hours), and as of this weekend Beyonc\u00e9, whose Lemonade appeared without a hitch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edb8d282586bedb604b67280374687a40a57856a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edb8d282586bedb604b67280374687a40a57856a/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade was an exclusive on Tidal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade was an exclusive on Tidal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there\u2019s Prince, who withdrew his catalogue from all streaming services except Tidal, and debuted the albums HitNRun and HitNRun Phase Two through it. Tidal wisely decided against trying to capitalise on Prince\u2019s death. Equally, though, striking a deal with a chap who was not easily persuaded when it came to allowing others to exploit his work must have paid dividends.</p> <p>If Tidal was good enough for Prince, maybe it should be good enough for the rest of us. Music Business Worldwide editor Tim Ingham, who has been closely following Tidal\u2019s ups and downs, reckons that it is wrong to totally write it off. \u201cTidal\u2019s not only showing rival services up with its exclusive content, but also the slickness of its presentation \u2013 which is undeniable,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you forget the circus surrounding its creation and management failings, Tidal, the product, is an excellent streaming service.\u201d</p> <p>Still, it has entered a crowded marketplace where companies are competing to stake a claim on streaming while the technology is still in its relative infancy (on-demand streaming doubled in the US in 2015, and increased by 82% in the UK). In a world where Spotify recently raised an extra \u00a31bn in funding, the $56m Jay Z paid for Tidal<strong> </strong>is loose change. \u201cEvery established, non-Apple/Google-owned player I can think of which hasn\u2019t gone bust yet is losing millions of dollars every month,\u201d Ingham argues. \u201cMusic streaming is an economically torturous game, and Tidal is the runt of the litter.\u201d</p> <p>Spotify currently has at least 30 million paying customers and another 70 million using its free tier. Apple Music stands at 13 million and Tidal at just three million. So if Tidal is the underdog, how come nobody\u2019s cheering the company on? Its pledge to pay more to artists is unequivocally a good thing, right? Unfortunately for Tidal, the backlash that followed Tidal\u2019s star-studded launch suggests potential users were so dazzled by Deadmau5\u2019s glistening helmet that they couldn\u2019t see the smaller artists who would also stand to benefit. Tidal\u2019s high-quality streams, meanwhile, have been popular with early adopters, but are of little interest to mass-market music fans.</p> <p>It is worth noting that Tidal\u2019s reliance on exclusive album streams from big-name acts can backfire. Take Kanye\u2019s The Life of Pablo, which debuted on Tidal. \u201cMy album will never never never be on Apple,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/699376240709402624\" title=\"\">he tweeted</a> at the time. \u201cAnd it will never be for sale ... You can only get it on Tidal.\u201d The album is now on sale elsewhere, and streaming on all major services. One fan was so dismayed by this perceived betrayal that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/18/kanye-west-fan-lawsuit-life-of-pablo-album-tidal-spotify\" title=\"\">he filed a lawsuit against Kanye and Tidal</a>, a response so melodramatic that even Kanye himself might grudgingly approve.</p> <p>Most fans won\u2019t sue Tidal, but after Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade appeared for sale on iTunes less than a day into Tidal\u2019s exclusive, it is easy to see how they might grow wary of signing up to any service just to hear one album. On Monday, Matthew Hussey, editor-in-chief of the technology website the Next Web, published an article titled <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/insider/2016/04/25/shouldnt-subscribe-tidal-even-beyonce-fan/#gref\" title=\"\">\u201cWhy You Shouldn\u2019t Subscribe to Tidal, Even if You\u2019re a Beyonc\u00e9 Fan\u201d</a>. \u201cOf course, there was nothing explicit in Tidal\u2019s promotion that said, \u2018No one else will have this\u2019,\u201d he tells me now. \u201cBut it must feel like a slap in the face to have signed up \u2013 you can\u2019t sign up without giving bank details \u2013 only to find another service has it.\u201d</p> <p>Restricting availability of music to one service \u2013 windowing \u2013 is one of the key ways streaming services can differentiate their offerings, and in business terms it makes sense. Apple Music has been doing this a lot, too. Windowing is also controversial, particularly with fans who resent having to maintain numerous active subscriptions in the hope that they will hear new releases. I approached Tidal for comment about this and other topics. The company did agree to answer questions over email, but sadly nothing turned up. Looking on the bright side, their responses will probably appear on Spotify in a week or two.</p> <p>Deezer is a streaming service that can boast of up to twice as many users as Tidal. While Tidal and Apple Music have thrown equity and money at exclusives, its approach has been similar to Spotify\u2019s. Christian Harris, Deezer\u2019s UK and Ireland MD, told me that this involves finding new ways to introduce users to the millions of songs in its catalogue, rather than making noise about a specific 12 new tracks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"73bf8160a14cd4df47a147239bc6384713db68ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73bf8160a14cd4df47a147239bc6384713db68ea/0_0_2330_3000/777.jpg\" alt=\"If Tidal was good enough for Prince, why aren\u2019t we all using it?\" width=\"777\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If Tidal was good enough for Prince, why aren\u2019t we all using it?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Micelotta/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last week, he had YouGov in the Deezer office. The organisation was doing research following Deezer\u2019s recent TV ad campaign \u2013 part of the company\u2019s attempt to take streaming to mainstream audiences. The results showed a bump for Tidal\u2019s brand recognition off the back of some of its exclusives. \u201cBut from what we can see there isn\u2019t the same result in terms of revenues,\u201d says Harris, \u201cand Tidal is still a minnow in the world of global music streaming. We don\u2019t regard them as serious competition. The odd exclusive makes for a nice soundbite, but it doesn\u2019t make for a complete service.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Harris if he has listened to the Beyonc\u00e9 album. He hasn\u2019t had a spare minute, he admits. \u201cIf I was going to, personally I\u2019d probably listen for free on Tidal on a trial account,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not so bothered about what Beyonc\u00e9 does or doesn\u2019t do on her husband\u2019s platform that I\u2019d rush to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere, a music industry source intimately acquainted with the streaming world argues that windowing can actually be damaging to artists. \u201cLet\u2019s look at what happened with Kanye,\u201d they told me. \u201cHe windowed for two months. If you look at his public listener figures since Pablo went on Spotify, you can see he\u2019s had like a 50% jump, from around 15 million monthly listeners to around 22 million. Pablo only hit No 1 when it hit non-exclusive.\u201d As for Beyonc\u00e9? \u201cShe\u2019s No 1 on lots of charts. She\u2019s No 1 on The Pirate Bay, she\u2019s No 1 on KickAss Torrents \u2026\u201d</p> <p>While it\u2019s true that social media timelines are full of Beyonc\u00e9 fans grudgingly signing up to Tidal, it appears that exclusives are tempting others into piracy.</p> <p>One way to warn artists away from windowing might be for the biggest streaming services, such as Spotify, to pull down the shutters on artists who have windowed elsewhere. For them to say: \u201cActually, you know what, you\u2019ve got your lump sum of cash from Apple Music for keeping your album off our service for a week \u2013 we\u2019ll give it a miss thanks.\u201d Over at Spotify, Jonathan Prince, the company\u2019s global head of communications and public policy, does not think that is likely. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of getting offended,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t take it personally. We want all these people on the service because their fans want to listen to them, but we get that artists make decisions for all sorts of different reasons: business-related, philosophical, whatever. They\u2019re creating great work and they\u2019ve got a right to make their own decisions.\u201d</p> <p>And what of Tidal\u2019s claim to pay artists \u201cproperly\u201d, while other services allegedly do not? \u201cIn order to really understand the value being created, we need to move away from this antiquated notion of per stream or per listen,\u201d Prince begins. \u201cWe need to measure success based on the value of the consumer, not the value of the individual transaction. If a consumer\u2019s paying $120 a year to listen to music, that\u2019s much more than what the average consumer was worth at the height of the music industry. And it\u2019s why the industry is finally growing again.\u201d</p> <p>Rather more bluntly, he adds: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got one user listening to one song a month, you can say \u2018We pay $10 a stream\u2019, but you\u2019ve still only got one user, so it\u2019s like, big freaking deal.\u201d</p> <p>It may even be the case that being \u201cthe artist\u2019s friend\u201d is an unsustainable business model for Tidal. \u201cSo far,\u201d Tim Ingham points out, \u201cthe bigger independent streaming services get, the bigger their losses become. That gamble especially applies for any platform arbitrarily promising artists a higher royalty rate than Spotify, a company which has shattered its bottom line to pay music rights holders the most it possibly can.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61c77e555fc07099c8cfb5b8b968dc96b18e3a1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61c77e555fc07099c8cfb5b8b968dc96b18e3a1e/0_285_4581_2748/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kanye West \u2013 who released his album The Life of Pablo exclusively on Tidal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kanye West, who released his album The Life of Pablo exclusively on Tidal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps, however, it was never the plan for Tidal to rival huge services such as Spotify. Maybe Jay Z really was incredibly naive when he thought a combination of star power and the tech world\u2019s equivalent of loose change would make a streaming service work. But does Jay Z strike you as a particularly naive guy? One line of thought is that he was playing a different game from the beginning.</p> <p>Ingham spells it out. \u201cJay Z is a thoroughbred businessman,\u201d he says. \u201cHe likes making money. You might have noticed he talks about it quite a lot. Tidal can\u2019t win the streaming wars, but it can cause a racket, get bought by a real player and ensure Jay Z and his fellow superstar shareholders are paid handsomely in the process. I suspect Tidal\u2019s celebrity harem have had this laid out for them: \u2018Back us, and when we sell, you\u2019ll get paid big.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Matthew Hussey predicts Tidal will end up being bought out by Samsung, a company that has watched its closest rivals in the handset world \u2013 Apple and Android \u2013 build platforms and revenue streams with their own streaming services.</p> <p>Considering the media narrative on Tidal, this would be the ultimate plot twist. If Jay Z does, indeed, flip Tidal and make himself a billionaire in the process, Tidal could be the smartest financial move of his career.</p>",

I thoroughly enjoyed this book; there are lots of action packed and thrilling moments. The story is mostly concentrated on the two main characters, who were amazing characters. I especially loved the character of Sacha - he has that bad-boy appearance, and is really sarcastic, but deep down he cares about his loved ones. I identified a little with Taylor because she loves books and she is a determined and hard-working person.

      "bodyText": "This play charts the tortured 20-year relationship between a girl with cerebral palsy and a Chicago teacher. It is written and co-performed by Athena Stevens and is a testament to the drive and willpower of disabled people. Since Stevens herself was born with athetoid cerebral palsy, it has a palpable authenticity that overcomes its preachiness. Stevens plays Katherine who, as a 14-year-old, invades the apartment of a suicidal teacher, Harrison, and pleads with him to be taken out of special education and granted a place in his math class. Although Katherine is bright and determined, the play charts the obstacles she has to overcome: even Harrison tells her there is a schism between expectation and reality where disappointment breeds. But, as an initially platonic relationship grows into something serious, Katherine challenges Harrison by studying to become an architect \u2013 the very profession to which he once aspired. There is something schematic about Katherine\u2019s rise and Harrison\u2019s fall, but the play clearly captures the single-mindedness of disabled people. Katherine bluntly tells her partner, \u201cI will do anything to get what I want\u201d and, significantly, it is she who packs the condoms for a supposedly innocent weekend trip. Stevens brings out all of Katherine\u2019s inner strength and sexual need, Tim Beckman is equally good as the dispirited teacher, and Alex Sims directs sensitively. Even if the play overstates the message that disability is no bar to ambition, it is propaganda in a good cause. \u2022 At the Finborough, London, until 14 May. Box office: 0800 847 1652",

      "bodyText": "Nico Rosberg took victory at the Russian Grand Prix with a pole to flag win ahead of his team-mate Lewis Hamilton, who finished in second after a controlled recovery drive from 10th on the grid. It is Rosberg\u2019s fourth win of the season and his seventh in a row since Hamilton claimed the world championship in Austin last year, taking the German\u2019s career total to 18. He now leads his Mercedes team-mate by 43 points, with 17 races remaining. With the gap as it stands, were Hamilton to take a string of one-two wins over Rosberg, it would still require seven races for him to overtake his team-mate. Rosberg had started from pole, after Hamilton\u2019s mechanical failure left him unchallenged in the final session of qualifying, where he was a full seven-tenths clear of his nearest competitor, Sebastian Vettel in the Ferrari, and in race pace the Mercedes proved yet again unassailable. Rosberg won by 25 seconds from his team-mate and almost 32 seconds from Kimi Raikkonen, who finished third in the other Ferrari. It was another pitch-perfect run from Rosberg, who was unchallenged again in clean air and did exactly enough to take the win. He has yet to be truly tested this season but, given the competition he has been offered, he is admirably yet to put so much as a foot wrong. If he is to become champion, these are the performances on which it will be built. \u201cEverything worked very well this weekend, thanks a lot,\u201d said Rosberg to his team at the flag. Behind him, tempers were less cool. After their spat at the last round in China, Red Bull\u2019s Daniil Kvyat once again earned the ire of Sebastian Vettel, having run into the back of him at turn two. Then, to add insult injury, the Russian gave him another tap at the back that caused Vettel to spin into the wall at three, ending his race on the first lap. \u201cWhat the fuck are we doing here?\u201d the exasperated German inquired. Kvyat received a 10-second stop-go penalty, which was of no consolation whatsoever to Vettel. The penalty, said Vettel, \u201cdoesn\u2019t help me, as I am still here and the race is still happening\u201d. Asked if he would speak to the Russian driver he added: \u201cIf anybody needs to talk to somebody, I guess it is him.\u201d But having said so he did go and talk to his former, and Kvyat\u2019s current team principal, Christian Horner, on the pit wall mid-race, to ensure the message he would not say publicly was passed on. More celebrated was McLaren putting two drivers in the points for the first time this season, with Fernando Alonso finishing in sixth and Jenson Button in 10th. Rosberg had taken advantage of pole with a clean run through the first two corners, avoiding the chaos involving Vettel and Kvyat in his wake, which had caused the virtual safety car to be deployed on lap one. Hamilton took advantage of the messy start by the drivers in front of his 10th-placed grid position through the first corners and was up to fifth under the virtual safety car; he quickly overtook Felipe Massa shortly after the restart on lap four and had passed Kimi Raikkonen on lap seven to take third. He was then bottled up behind the Williams of Valtteri Bottas, who was as ever driving a solid line and hard to pass as Rosberg stretched his lead to more than 13 seconds. Hamilton then pitted a lap after the Finn on lap 17, a stop that took half a second longer than the Williams\u2019s, ensuring Hamilton rejoined once again behind him. However, pushing hard on slightly fresher tyres, the British driver managed to take second place only a lap later as the pair drew up behind Alonso\u2019s McLaren. After Rosberg had taken his stop on lap 21 the gap between the two Mercedes drivers was 12.9 seconds and, although Hamilton pushed, Rosberg was once again on rails. A determined Hamilton was not giving up, however, and he had the gap down to 7.5sec on lap 36 when he began to suffer from a water pressure problem and was forced to come off the pace. The crew told him it had stabilised five laps later but by then he was again 13 seconds in arrears and too far to come back and Rosberg pumped in some very quick laps at the end to prove he still had something in reserve. The Mercedes executive director, Toto Wolff, was pleased to see both cars reach the end. \u201cWe had worries with both of the cars during the race,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a water leak problem on Lewis\u2019s cars which stabilised toward the end and on the other car we were having strange signals from the power unit.\u201d He was also sympathetic regarding Hamilton\u2019s poor luck this weekend. \u201cLewis will get the break eventually,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cHe was doing well, he was going fast and trying to take the win, but we just need to give him the car where he can push.\u201d Last year\u2019s Russian Grand Prix was held later in the season, with Hamilton taking his ninth win before going on to clinch the title at the next round in Austin. Rosberg, in contrast, retired with a throttle problem, knowing his bid was as good as over. The German\u2019s win here is less conclusive in the title race with 17 rounds remaining but he has ensured the task Hamilton described this weekend as a \u201cmountain to climb\u201d remains so, despite the British driver\u2019s well-fought second place. Bottas finished in fourth ahead of his Williams team-mate Massa in fifth. Renault\u2019s Kevin Magnussen put in a very strong drive to take seventh from 17th on the grid, with Haas\u2019s Romain Grosjean and Force India\u2019s Sergio P\u00e9rez in eighth and ninth respectively.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s an on-the-flag report of Nico Rosberg\u2019s latest triumph: Rosberg says \u201cit\u2019s been an awesome weekend, the car\u2019s been fantastic\u201d before bigging up Russian F1. \u201cThe sport is growing here,\u201d he booms. \u201cI enjoyed it out there, and enjoyed going flat out to the end.\u201d Hamilton said it was not the easiest first corner but \u201call races have been the same so far\u201d. He\u2019s happy for the team, he says, but looks decidedly glum. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a doubt in my mind that I could win it, I had the pace,\u201d he says, \u201cbut then I had a problem with the engine.\u201d Ho hum. Raikkonen, having secured Ferrari\u2019s 700th ever podium, said third \u201cwasn\u2019t exactly what we want\u201d but was pleased with his start, even if he couldn\u2019t sustain it after the restart. \u201cWe were not fast enough for Mercedes,\u201d he concedes. Well that was all a bit too easy for Rosberg for it to be a classic race. The early chaos will generate some fallout though, with home hero Kvyat becoming something of a villain for his role in Vettel\u2019s earlier withdrawal. Lewis Hamilton\u2019s winless run continues, as it always looked likely to after his travails yesterday, though he fought his way back impressively to take second. And there were decent drives from Alonso, Magnussen and Button too. Stay on the site for our race report and all the reaction and analysis from Sochi. Rosberg is now being awkwardly glad-handed back stage by Vladimir Putin, such is modern sport (and modern politics). Punk revivalism\u2019s Bernie Ecclestone is beaming excitedly among it all too. Rosberg\u2019s lead from Hamilton is now 43 points, and Mercedes are romping it even more emphatically in the Constructors\u2019 Championship. \u201cWe\u2019ve finally done it in Russia,\u201d says Mercedes engineer Tony Ross to his race winner, who of course didn\u2019t complete this race last year. Bottas finishes fourth, Masa fifth and Alonso gets on the board at last in sixth. Elsewhere, Magnussen gets Renault\u2019s first points of the season, finishing seventh. And Jenson Button secures a top-10 slot in 10th. Toto Wolff confirms the \u201cwater-leak problem\u201d on Hamilton\u2019s car, and he had \u201cstrange signals\u201d from Rosberg\u2019s. Hamilton \u201cwill get the break eventually\u201d, says Mercedes\u2019 executive director. Lewis Hamilton is second to make it another Mercedes 1-2, Kimi Raikkonen takes third. Hamilton\u2019s not a man to settle for second, but he drove very well nonetheless and will have reasons for satisfaction. That fast penultimate lap of 39 was a stern statement of intent and Rosberg just cruises home, and it\u2019s another Mercedes triumph in Russia. Lap 52: In the manner of a cricket team chasing down a modest target of 200, Rosberg is just getting them in metaphorical singles as he eases towards victory. His lead is unassailable after setting the fastest lap on the 52nd circuit. Lap 51: Jolyon Palmer is overtaken for 12th by Ricciardo. Grosjean is still winning the battle for eighth, but no change at all in the podium positions as we go into the penultimate lap. Lap 50: Jenson Button takes on Sainz at a turn and moves into the top 10 outright. There\u2019s points to be had for the former champion here, with Grosjean and Perez ahead of him within reach. Rosberg leads by more than 14 seconds now. Lap 49: Raikkonen is closing on Hamilton, the gap between second and third closing eight seconds. Lap 48: Button in 11th still hasn\u2019t got past the penalised Sainz but 8th and 9th are within his sights if he can overtake. The Rosberg Procession Event continues out at the front though. He\u2019s 12.8secs clear of Hamilton. Lap 47: Felipe Massa pits to put on super-soft tyres. He stays fifth though. A few places back Grosjean has stretched his advantage in eighth over his nearest pursuer P\u00e9rez. Lap 46: Mercedes have never been beaten in a Russian grand prix, we are reminded, and they\u2019re not going to be here now either. Raikkonen in third stretches his lead over Bottas in fourth to more than 11 seconds. Going back to the start of the race kerfuffling, \u201cKvyat might as well write his letter of resignation after that incident,\u201d thunders Matthew Hull. \u201cThis track is bad. This is the new Valencia. It\u2019s so dull and uninspired. It\u2019s a car park surrounded by a prison camp.\u201d Lap 45: Hamilton\u2019s lead over Raikkonen is being cut a little too, the Finn in third place now only 11 seconds behind the world champion. Rosberg looks utterly untroubled now, and is poised to extend his championship lead even further. Lap 44: Kevin Magnussen is having an excellent race in his Renault, currently winning the hotly contested battle for seventh. Rosberg leads by 13.7secs, and coming up to some more backmarker traffic. Lap 43: Button has a very good top-10 shout here, just tucked in in 11th behind Mainz, who has a penalty to be added. The gap between Rosberg and Hamilton is 13.5secs. Lap 42: \u201cLewis the situation has stabilised,\u201d the world champion is told over the radio. But he\u2019s still more than 13 seconds back with less than a quarter of the race remaining. It\u2019s been confirmed that he was losing water pressure. Lap 41: Wehrlein goes into the pits for a while to put super-softs back on. They\u2019re having trouble fitting them, and he\u2019s sat there for almost a minute. Rosberg still leads, and it\u2019s stretched to 13 seconds from Hamilton Lap 40: Williams\u2019 race has faded badly since the stops, with Bottas and Masa drifting a little in fourth and fifth. Raikkonen has cemented his advantage over them in third. Lap 39: Jenson Button is well placed for an assualt on the top 10, sitting 11th but gaining ground and with the seventh placed car in sight. Lap 38: Hamilton\u2019s definitely going slower, dogged by the overheating issue, while Rosberg sets a new lap record. Raikkonen remains third. Lap 37: Uh-oh. Hamilton is radioed to be told he has a water pressure issue. You can hear the despair in the driver\u2019s sigh, given that he\u2019d taken five seconds off Rosberg since the pitstops. On he perseveres, 8.220 secs behind. Lap 36: The gap between the front two closes, to 7.2secs, which is no mean feat for Hamilton given the traffic he had to deal with on this lap. The other big jostle is between seventh, where Magnussen currently is, and Palmer in 12th. Lap 35: Hamilton\u2019s an outsider in this race, but he\u2019s still going for it. He struggles to overtake the backmarkers though, and remains second behind a composed Rosberg. Lap 34: Max Verstappen has a bit of engine bother with his Toro Rosso, and has stopped on turn two. That\u2019s his race done, after a promising start. So Alonso moves into sixth. Lap 33: Rosberg has moved past Nasr and Wehrlein, among the backmarkers a lap behind, and is now taking on Kvyatt. Hamilton closes the gap to 8.4sec and Raikkonen\u2019s 17 seconds behind in third place. Bottas is fourth and Masa fifth. Lap 32: Rosberg is now coming into a bit of lapped traffic in front of him, as he moves into a group of four or five cars. Hamilton\u2019s gaining a bit more \u2013 11.1secs now. Lap 31: The gap between Rosberg in first and Hamilton in second is now down to 11.443 seconds. Meanwhile Perez moves above Sainz into the top 10. Lap 30: Fernando Alonso is having a good, smooth race, in seventh place, and well placed to get his first points this term. Lap 29: Ricciardo overhauls Magnusen to put himself in eighth but Magnussen comes back at him annd regains his position, Grosjean is involved too and overtakes Ricciardo. It\u2019s a tenacious old battle for scraps there. Lap 28: Meanwhile, the front three is unchanged. The gap from Rosberg to his pursuers still formidable. Lap 27: Kvyat is at the centre of things again, as Wehrlein takes him on but he is then resisted by Nasr place. It\u2019s a right old ding-dong battle and Kvyat then does taken on Wehrlein and moves ahead of him in 17th. Lap 26: Sainz has been hit with a 10-second penalty. Lap 25: For all the despondency in the Hamilton camp this weekend, he\u2019s driven with composure and skill today. Carlos Sainz is under investigation for forcing Palmer off the track in the incident at turn 2 in lap 23. Rosberg still clear in front by 12.8secs. Lap 24: Daniel Ricciardo, well placed on the grid but who began dreadfully, continues to toil in 10th. But no change in the podium positions, though Hamilton\u2019s just set a new fastest lap in the race time of 1:40.922 Lap 23: Verstappen finally comes in for his pit stop. Further back, Jolyon Palmer almost came off at turn two, having to go wide and slow, but he continues. The Briton sits in 14th. It\u2019s now Rosberg 1 Hamilton 2 Raikkonen 3. Lap 22: Rosberg leads from Hamilton and Raikkonen, in net podium terms. Verstappen is currently second, but has yet to pit. Lap 21: As things shake down after a glut of pit stops, Raikkonen has moved up into a net podium place, ahead of Bottas. All of this is passing Rosberg by, who leads comfortably. Lap 20: Raikkonen is being brought into the pits, as Bottas gets past Alonso. Rosberg still leads. Lap 19: Hamilton throws a move on Bottas down the inside on turn 2, it\u2019s a real old battle, and Hamilton forges clear. He\u2019s currently fifth. Alonso ahead of him in fourth. Raikkonen second, Verstappen third. Lap 18: Hamilton follows into the pits. Soft tyres coming on in a 3.2sec change, 0.5sec slower than Bottas\u2019s. And Bottas takes on Hamilton at turn two as the latter returns, and Bottas moves back ahead of him. Will that longer pit-stop time prove pivotal? Rosberg still leads. Lap 17: Bottas comes in for his pit stop, soft compounds going on. It\u2019s an impressively swift change from the Williams team. But Hamilton is second for now. And away from the track Vettel and Christian Horner are having a bit of a feisty exchange. Lap 16: Hamilton backs off a little, possibly cooling tyres and engine, but Bottas is holding position well in second. Raikkonen is enjoying these super-softs, as he showed over the previous two days, and is likely to remain a threat. Lap 15: Rosberg leads, Bottas second, Hamilton within DRS range in third, Raikkonen still close to the Briton in fourth. Lap 14: Already, second is looking Hamilton\u2019s best bet, which is a fine recovery from qualifying but not what he ultimately wants. Sebastian Vettel is now being interviewed. \u201cI got a big hit, lucky not to spin into turn two,\u201d he says. He\u2019s calmed down a little, officially anyway. \u201cThese things happen,\u201d he says when asked about Kvyat. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I could have done differently,\u201d he sighs. Lap 13: Raikkonen is making some ground again in fourth place, maling up 7/10 of a second on Hamilton, Rosberg now nine seconds clear after setting the fastest lap time. Lap 12: Hamilton still not quite near enough to make his move. Rosberg still leads. Nasr is in the pits with a slow puncture Lap 11: Elsewhere, Perez is within a second of Button, the British driver still 12th. As it was at the front. No big moves yet. Lap 10: Some movement from the Mercedes team in the garage as Rosberg continues to lead from Bottas, with Hamilton third. Lap 9: The unruffled Bottas increases his lead over Hamilton to 7/10 of a second. Rosberg still leads. Lap 8: It\u2019s as you were. Kvyatt\u2019s Red Bull is damaged, and his already chaotic race takes another turn. He\u2019s back in the pits. Possibly to retire? No, a 10-second stop-go penalty. Lap 7: Raikkonen tries to take on Bottas again, but Bottas holds him off, and then Hamilton takes him on on the turn, cuts inside and moves into third. Excellent stuff. Lap 6: Hamilton is four and a half seconds behind Rosberg, who still leads. The top order stays the same Lap 5: Hamilton is nicely placed here, he has the leaders in his sights but Rosberg is still clear. Kvyat pitted and is now trying to forge his way back up the field, into 15th, though he may face a penalty for that earlier mess. Bottas is second, Raikkonen third. Lap 4: Bottas overtakes Raikkonen on the restart, Hamilton moves on Masa and climbs into fourth. Fernando Alonso has crept up to seventh. Rosberg is yet to be troubled out in front though, three seconds clear. Lap 3: Replaying the Vettel incident again, the mic relays him complaining of hitting twice. His language is, well, industrial. He\u2019s an angry man \u2013 Kvyatt may need to steer clear of him later. The safety car is coming in at the end of this lap. Lap 2: It\u2019s confirmed that Kvyat hit Vettel twice. Well turn 2 has proven its menace here \u2013 that was mayhem. The full safety car is still out. Hulkenburg was also a victim of that early chaos and is out. Rosberg leads from Raikkonen, with Bottas third, Masa fourth, Hamilton fifth Lap 1: Perez took a knock too and he\u2019s losing rubber. He and Ricciardo have pitted already. Rosberg leads from Bottas, with Raikkonen third. Pretty much the entire field start on super-softs. Rosberg is away well. Ricciardo gains a place on Vettel, then Raikkonen takes second on turn 2 and then Vettel is out on the first corner! \u2013 a Red Bull colliding with the Ferrari colliding, thought to be Kvyat\u2019s. Hamilton is up into fifth. And they\u2019re out for the Russian anthem (still one of the finest, musically), Bernie Ecclestone casting his eyes solemnly skyward, perhaps as a reverent gesture to his political mucker Vlad P. It\u2019s a beautiful day in Sochi, the mountains providing an alluring backdrop. Martin Brundle\u2019s doing his grid walk, and stumbles into Niki Lauda, who says Hamilton must stay out of trouble at the start and just keep on going. He should be able to pass comfortably enough. Lauda\u2019s dismissive of claims more safety regulation is needed. \u201cToday, Formula One is safe,\u201d he proclaims. Jenson Button, starting in 12th, is accosted for some epic bantz about the olduns\u2019 disco in their hotel last night. Red Bull\u2019s Christian Horner says \u201cwe\u2019re not allowed to talk about\u201d fuel consumption issues, and quips that they\u2019ll be talking about it in code. But he\u2019s upbeat about Daniel Ricciardo\u2019s chances, staring from fifth. Talk in the paddock that conditions make this a possible one-stop race for drivers, beginning with super-soft tyres before switching to softs. Max Verstappen\u2019s spluttering exhaust sounded a bit poorly as it started in the practice lane there. Meanwhile, you\u2019ll be wanting a Sochi circuit guide won\u2019t you? Here goes: Let\u2019s not forget, of course, that this weekend is one of the sport\u2019s most poignant of anniversaries. This is the first time a grand prix has taken place on 1 May since Aytron Senna\u2019s death. Lewis hasn\u2019t forgotten: How they line up on the grid: 1 Rosberg 1:35.417 2 Bottas 1:36.536 3 Raikkonen 1:36.663 4 Massa 1:37.016 5 Ricciardo 1:37.125 6 P\u00e9rez 1:37.212 7 Vettel 1:36.1233 8 Kvyat 1:37.459 9 Verstappen 1:37.583 10 Hamilton Afternoon everyone. M\u2019colleague Giles Richards argued entertainingly in the week that Bernie Ecclestone\u2019s latest bout of shock-jockish opinion-blabbing indicated the F1 supremo was going through a punk phase - \u201cthere\u2019s no future \u2013 and F1\u2019s dreeaamiiiinnng\u201d, if you will \u2013 though such is the persistent low-level discontented whine about the state of the sport that it feels more like an \u201980s indie-miserabilism period. Either that, or full-on, strumming-on-the-porch whiskey-soused Blues. Cockpit protection rules, engine regulations, a general need for greater entertainment \u2013 you name it, there\u2019s complaints about it. We need some decent racing then. We did get an incident-packed race in Shanghai last time out, to be fair, the upshot of it being, however, that Nico Rosberg extended his already dominant lead at the top of the standings. And he\u2019s set fair to extend it today, having taken pole effortlessly yesterday. Though he had pole last year in Russia too, and ended up retiring early and handing victory to Lewis Hamilton. Ah Hamilton. His transformation from gilded all-conquering superstar to F1\u2019s Unlucky Alf continued yesterday with more engine woe in qualifying. Toto Wolff on Sky right now is dismissing conspiracy theory talk from \u201clunatics\u201d and says \u201cthe last thing we want to do is penalise Lewis\u201d. The team are \u201cdoing their utmost\u201d to help the world champion, he says. Reuters, meanwhile, is reporting that Mercedes have flown parts in by private jet from Britain overnight to keep Hamilton on the starting grid after his engine problems yesterday. He will definitely start from 10th The Briton will start the race in 10th place, with championship-leading team mate Nico Rosberg on pole position and set for his seventh win in a row, but his predicament could have been much worse. The team said Hamilton, who has not won since he took his third title in Texas last October, would have had to start from the pitlane if a new fuel system had not been flown to Sochi from the engine factory at Brixworth. Drivers are allowed five power units per season, and are penalised for exceeding that amount, but they can swap out the six main components without sanction as long as they remain within their quota and the parts are of the same specification. Hamilton\u2019s problem was that the unit in his car at Sochi had been upgraded since the previous race in China and the team did not have a spare fuel system in Russia of the same specification. \u201cWe had to fly out a fuel system on a chartered jet yesterday evening, arriving here in the early hours, and the spare engine was then kitted with these parts during the night,\u201d a spokesman said. The engine is not subject to strict post-qualifying \u2018parc ferme\u2019 rules which keep the car off limits to mechanics overnight. \u201cWhen the car came out of parc ferme this morning, the spare power unit was fitted and has now fired up successfully in the garage,\u201d said the spokesman. Hamilton has won the only two races held to date in Sochi, taking last year\u2019s after Rosberg started on pole position and then suffered a throttle failure. The Briton had started from the back of the grid in China after failing to set a time in qualifying due to another power unit failure. Mercedes said they had re-fitted the unit Hamilton used in the Australian season-opener in Melbourne, which was the spare for Sochi. The control electronics and energy store were replaced to eliminate them as a potential source of the problem but the unit that failed will not be inspected until the return to the factory. They\u2019re off at 1pm. Tom Davies will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s Giles Richards\u2019 latest report from trackside. Formula One\u2019s race director Charlie Whiting has confirmed that the use of a cockpit protection device in the sport is still set to go ahead for the 2017 season,despite objections from some drivers over the weekend in Russia. However the F1 chief executive, Bernie Ecclestone, stated on Sunday morning that he was not in favour of employing the cockpit safety system. Whiting also confirmed that there is a timetable in place for a decision to be made between the two systems currently being tested, the halo device and Red Bull\u2019s aeroscreen, which made its first appearance in Sochi on Friday in practice. The deadline for confirming which device will be instituted was 1 July, Whiting said, to allow teams time to incorporate it into their designs for next year\u2019s cars, which will also be subject to the new aero and engine regulations that were confirmed this week. \u201cIt would be unreasonable if we didn\u2019t have a clear path by that time,\u201d said Whiting. \u201cIt would be fairly unreasonable to expect teams to change chassis which is what it amounts to because this is a fundamental part of it. Their chassis design is normally fixed by this time. It\u2019s only a small part of the chassis and it\u2019s not going to affect things like fuel volume and those big things but it\u2019s still part of a complex design process.\u201d Ecclestone, speaking at the track in Sochi on Sunday morning, was less enamoured of the concept. When asked what Formula One should do on the cockpit safety question he answered \u201cnothing\u201d and asserted that racing should continue with an open cockpit. \u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said and added that he did not believe it would necessarily achieve its goal, before questioning the testing methods the devices had undergone. He asked why the sport should \u201ctry to simulate something where you have a stationary object and fire a tyre at it, when in the race when the wheel has come off normally both cars will be moving? \u201cSo how can you simulate it by having a car stationary? And how would you ever know what is going to happen with a wheel? If it hits the thing it will probably bounce off anyway.\u201d The halo device, tested by Ferrari during pre-season, was understood to be the strong favourite to be employed but the success of Red Bull\u2019s aeroscreen, which they will run again in free practice in Spain and Monaco, has levelled the playing field. \u201cBoth devices are equally likely,\u201d said Whiting. \u201cA couple of months ago I would have said that the Red Bull solution was not likely to be implemented in 2017 but they have really accelerated the work on it in a short space of time to bring it to the point where it has now been tested successfully in the same way as the halo.\u201d Ecclestone\u2019s opinions are likely to hold little sway with the FIA who, although they could impose the device on teams, are unlikely to feel the need to do so, although a unanimous agreement would still be required to introduce a device in 2017. \u201cEveryone\u2019s aware that we want to press ahead with this,\u201d Whiting said. \u201cWe are not expecting any teams to object, simply because it is a matter of safety. We are not expecting to have to invoke the safety card.\u201d If both devices reach the same safety standard the decision on which to choose will be put to the F1 commission.",

He\u2019s happy for the team, he says, but looks decidedly glum. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a doubt in my mind that I could win it, I had the pace,\u201d he says, \u201cbut then I had a problem with the engine.\u201d Ho hum.</p> <p>Raikkonen, having secured Ferrari\u2019s 700th ever podium, said third \u201cwasn\u2019t exactly what we want\u201d but was pleased with his start, even if he couldn\u2019t sustain it after the restart. \u201cWe were not fast enough for Mercedes,\u201d he concedes.</p> <p>Well that was all a bit too easy for Rosberg for it to be a classic race. The early chaos will generate some fallout though, with home hero Kvyat becoming something of a villain for his role in Vettel\u2019s earlier withdrawal. Lewis Hamilton\u2019s winless run continues, as it always looked likely to after his travails yesterday, though he fought his way back impressively to take second.

In the meantime, here\u2019s Giles Richards\u2019 latest report from trackside.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Formula One\u2019s race director Charlie Whiting has confirmed that the use of a cockpit protection device in the sport is still set to go ahead for the 2017 season,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/30/formula-one-halo-drivers-divided-lewis-hamilton\">despite objections from some drivers</a> over the weekend in Russia.</p> <p>However the F1 chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernie-ecclestone\">Bernie Ecclestone</a>, stated on Sunday morning that he was not in favour of employing the cockpit safety system.</p> <p>Whiting also confirmed that there is a timetable in place for a decision to be made between the two systems currently being tested, the halo device and Red Bull\u2019s aeroscreen, which made its first appearance in Sochi on Friday in practice.</p> <p>The deadline for confirming which device will be instituted was 1 July, Whiting said, to allow teams time to incorporate it into their designs for next year\u2019s cars, which will also be subject to the new aero and engine regulations that were confirmed this week.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be unreasonable if we didn\u2019t have a clear path by that time,\u201d said Whiting. \u201cIt would be fairly unreasonable to expect teams to change chassis which is what it amounts to because this is a fundamental part of it. Their chassis design is normally fixed by this time. It\u2019s only a small part of the chassis and it\u2019s not going to affect things like fuel volume and those big things but it\u2019s still part of a complex design process.\u201d</p> <p>Ecclestone, speaking at the track in Sochi on Sunday morning, was less enamoured of the concept. When asked what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone\">Formula One</a> should do on the cockpit safety question he answered \u201cnothing\u201d and asserted that racing should continue with an open cockpit.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said and added that he did not believe it would necessarily achieve its goal, before questioning the testing methods the devices had undergone. He asked why the sport should \u201ctry to simulate something where you have a stationary object and fire a tyre at it, when in the race when the wheel has come off normally both cars will be moving?</p> <p>\u201cSo how can you simulate it by having a car stationary? And how would you ever know what is going to happen with a wheel? If it hits the thing it will probably bounce off anyway.\u201d</p> <p>The halo device, tested by Ferrari during pre-season, was understood to be the strong favourite to be employed but the success of Red Bull\u2019s aeroscreen, which they will run again in free practice in Spain and Monaco, has levelled the playing field.</p> <p>\u201cBoth devices are equally likely,\u201d said Whiting. \u201cA couple of months ago I would have said that the Red Bull solution was not likely to be implemented in 2017 but they have really accelerated the work on it in a short space of time to bring it to the point where it has now been tested successfully in the same way as the halo.\u201d</p> <p>Ecclestone\u2019s opinions are likely to hold little sway with the FIA who, although they could impose the device on teams, are unlikely to feel the need to do so, although a unanimous agreement would still be required to introduce a device in 2017. \u201cEveryone\u2019s aware that we want to press ahead with this,\u201d Whiting said. \u201cWe are not expecting any teams to object, simply because it is a matter of safety. We are not expecting to have to invoke the safety card.\u201d</p> <p>If both devices reach the same safety standard the decision on which to choose will be put to the F1 commission.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-01T09:31:01.206Z\">at 10.31am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Travelling around Thailand in the 1990s, William Janssen was impressed with the basic rooftop solar heating systems that were on many homes, where energy from the sun was absorbed by a plate and then used to heat water for the home. Two decades later and Janssen has developed that basic idea he saw in south-east Asia into a portable device that uses the power from the sun to purify water. The \u201cDesolenator\u201d operates as a mobile desalination unit that can take water from the sea, rivers and boreholes \u2013 as well as rain \u2013 and clean it for human consumption. The device, which looks like a thick solar photovoltaic panel on wheels, is aimed at a wide range of users \u2013 from homeowners in the developing world who do not have a constant supply of water to people living off the grid in rural parts of the US. Janssen saw that there was a need for a sustainable way to clean water in both the developing and the developed countries when he moved to the United Arab Emirates and saw large-scale water processing. \u201cI was confronted with the enormous carbon footprint that the Gulf nations have because of all of the desalination that they do ,\u201d he said. The Desolenator, which measures 120cm by 90cm, is a solar panel that converts sunlight into electricity, but also uses the heat that is generated from the sun as part of the process. In operation, water flows over the panel and soaks up the heat to bring it to a high temperature. It then flows into a small boiler in the device, which is powered by the electricity produced from the solar panel, and converted to steam. The steam is then converted back into cleaned water via a tube that changes the temperature again, while the waste flows out of the machine. Boiling the water gets rid of pollutants, said Janssen, such as arsenic and fluoride. \u201cThe device has a particle filter, a very simple filter which you can just shake empty, and the device is ready to deal with water which is slightly cloudy or slightly murky. It just flows through,\u201d he said. There are two tubes for liquid coming out \u2013 one for the brine waste and another for the distilled water. The water flows constantly through the device during the cleaning process \u2013 one litre flows through a number of times \u2013 and small volumes of water are distilled through boiling and heat exchange. It can produce 15 litres of distilled water in a day, which Janssen said is enough to sustain a family for cooking and drinking. An analysis released earlier this year found at least two-thirds of the world\u2019s population live with severe water scarcity for at least a month every year. Janssen said that by 2030, half of the world\u2019s population will be living with water stress \u2013 where the demand exceeds the supply over a certain period of time. \u201cIt is really important that a sustainable solution is brought to the market that is able to help these people and make sure there is an independence for themselves to be protected from this crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you go to places like Somalia, Yemen or Bangladesh, it is an immense problem because these people don\u2019t have the money for desalination plants, which are very expensive to build. They don\u2019t have the money to operate them, they are very maintenance intensive and they don\u2019t have the money to buy the diesel to run the desalination plants so it is really bad situation.\u201d The first commercial versions of the Desolenator are expected to be in operation in India early next year, after field tests are carried out. The market for the self-sufficient devices in developing countries is twofold \u2013 those who cannot afford the money for the device outright and pay through microfinance or by use, and middle income homes who can lease their own equipment. \u201cPeople in India don\u2019t pay for a fridge outright, they pay for it over six months. They would put the Desolenator on their roof and hook it up to their municipal supply and they would get very get very reliable drinking water on a daily basis,\u201d he said. In the developed world, it is aimed at niche markets where tap water is unavailable \u2013 for camping, on boats, for the military or even for survivalists preparing for a doomsday scenario. Prices will vary on where it is bought. In the developing world, the price will depend on what deal aid organisations can negotiate. In developed countries, it is likely to come in at $1,000 (\u00a3685) a unit, said Janssen. \u201cWe are a venture with a social mission. We are aware that the product we have envisioned is mainly finding application in the developing and humanitarian world and that this the way we will proceed. We do realise that to be a viable company there is a bottom line to keep in mind,\u201d he said. The company itself is based at Imperial College London although Janssen, its chief executive, still lives in the UAE. It has so far raised \u00a3340,000 in funding. Within two years, he said, the company aims to be selling 1,000 units a month, mainly in the humanitarian field. They are expected to be sold in areas such as Australia, northern Chile, Peru, Texas and California. \u2022 You can read our archive of The Innovators columns on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

      "bodyText": "So it is Europa League or bust for Liverpool, as far as this season goes. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team all but surrendered any hope of reaching the Champions League through a top-four finish, as they turned in a performance that practically invited defeat by Swansea City. The Welsh team swaggered to a win that confirmed their own presence in next season\u2019s top flight and proved they are a force not to be taken lightly. Andr\u00e9 Ayew scored twice, once either side of a delicious long-range strike by Jack Cork. Christian Benteke\u2019s goal for the visitors after being introduced from the bench meant nothing in terms of the result but ensured some satisfaction for a player in need of it. That, and a decent display by the goalkeeper Danny Ward, was about all Liverpool could be content with from a match in which they finished with 10 players, Brad Smith being sent off for two bookable offences. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed and frustrated because I know we could have played better,\u201d said Klopp. The German made eight changes to the Liverpool side that lost the Europa League semi-final first leg at Villarreal on Thursday, evidently preserving several players for the second leg. With a clutch of inexperienced youngsters given rare league starts, including a top-flight debut for the 18-year-old Pedro Chirivella, the Reds looked decidedly green, especially in midfield, where Chirivella and Kevin Stewart found it difficult to cope with the slick hosts. Swansea, who had lost their previous two matches heavily, had been accused of taking a leisurely approach to the end of their campaign but there were no such complaints here. \u201cWe were not on the beach,\u201d said their manager, Francesco Guidolin. Liverpool had won at Bournemouth with a youthful team two weeks ago but never looked comfortable here. Klopp was not about to draw hasty conclusions. \u201cI can\u2019t change my mind every two days,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo weeks ago everybody said \u2018oh my God, how good are these young players!\u2019\u201d And they are good. But the life of a professional footballer is not always honeymoons. You have to persevere and deliver. We all have to improve.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s youngsters could have benefited from better support from their senior team-mates here. Philippe Coutinho and Daniel Sturridge, in particular, sometimes had the air of laggards, only really coming alive when presented with the ball. When Sturridge lost possession to Jefferson Montero in midfield in the 14th minute, he stood and observed as Swansea built an incisive move that might have yielded a goal if Ayew had not volleyed wide from 16 yards. Six minutes later another shot by Ayew was deflected behind by Dejan Lovren for a corner that led to the opening goal. Gylfi Sigurdsson delivered with customary accuracy and Ayew showed better timing than any visitor to head the ball into the net from close range. Ward, making his second league start in place of Simon Mignolet, then made an excellent save with his feet to deny Cork after another flowing move by the hosts. But Cork left the goalkeeper grasping at air in the 33rd minute when slovenliness by Liverpool allowed him to retrieve the ball in midfield and he strode forward and guided a curling shot into the net from 20 yards. Sheyi Ojo, an enterprising 18-year-old, tried to wake Liverpool up. In the 36th minute he released Sturridge with a canny pass from the centre circle. The England striker clipped a first-time lob over Lukasz Fabianski but just the wrong side of the post. Klopp could not let Liverpool continue as they were. He made two substitutions at the break, introducing Benteke and Lucas Leiva for Coutinho and Chirivella. That helped Liverpool get a slightly better grip. Benteke, a player with even more to prove than any of the tyros, made his presence felt in the 65th minute, stooping to head in a corner by Ojo. But that was not the start of a comeback, merely the prelude to more Liverpool bungling. In the 67th minute Lucas received a pass midway inside his own half and lapsed into a reverie, allowing Montero to relieve him of the ball and skip past Martin Skrtel and into the box, where slapstick defending failed to distract him. Montero looked up and picked out Ayew, who scored. There was still time for the afternoon to deteriorate for the visitors. Smith, booked in the first half for pulling back Routledge, was shown a second yellow card for bumping into Kyle Naughton after the defender lifted the ball over him. Klopp\u2019s reaction suggested he found the decision poor. His team\u2019s performance was worse. The season could yet end with smiles and a Europa League triumph. Otherwise, Liverpool fans may find themselves in the funny position of having to hope Manchester United win the FA Cup final if Anfield is to see European action next season.

      "body": "<p>So it is Europa League or bust for Liverpool, as far as this season goes. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/01/swansea-v-liverpool-premier-league-live\" title=\"\">all but surrendered any hope </a>of reaching the Champions League through a top-four finish, as they turned in a performance that practically invited defeat by Swansea City. The Welsh team swaggered to a win that confirmed their own presence in next season\u2019s top flight and proved they are a force not to be taken lightly.</p> <p>Andr\u00e9 Ayew scored twice, once either side of a delicious long-range strike by Jack Cork. Christian Benteke\u2019s goal for the visitors after being introduced from the bench meant nothing in terms of the result but ensured some satisfaction for a player in need of it. That, and a decent display by the goalkeeper Danny Ward, was about all Liverpool could be content with from a match in which they finished with 10 players, Brad Smith being sent off for two bookable offences. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed and frustrated because I know we could have played better,\u201d said Klopp.</p> <p>The German made eight changes to the Liverpool side that lost the Europa League semi-final first leg at Villarreal on Thursday, evidently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/30/liverpool-jurgen-klopp-villarreal-europa-league-semi-final\" title=\"\">preserving several players for the second leg</a>. With a clutch of inexperienced youngsters given rare league starts, including a top-flight debut for the 18-year-old Pedro Chirivella, the Reds looked decidedly green, especially in midfield, where Chirivella and Kevin Stewart found it difficult to cope with the slick hosts. Swansea, who had lost their previous two matches heavily, had been accused of taking a leisurely approach to the end of their campaign but there were no such complaints here. \u201cWe were not on the beach,\u201d said their manager, Francesco Guidolin.</p> <p>Liverpool had won at Bournemouth with a youthful team two weeks ago but never looked comfortable here. Klopp was not about to draw hasty conclusions. \u201cI can\u2019t change my mind every two days,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo weeks ago everybody said \u2018oh my God, how good are these young players!\u2019\u201d And they are good. But the life of a professional footballer is not always honeymoons. You have to persevere and deliver. We all have to improve.\u201d</p> <p>Liverpool\u2019s youngsters could have benefited from better support from their senior team-mates here. Philippe Coutinho and Daniel Sturridge, in particular, sometimes had the air of laggards, only really coming alive when presented with the ball.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/01/swansea-v-liverpool-premier-league-live\">Swansea v Liverpool: Premier League \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Sturridge lost possession to Jefferson Montero in midfield in the 14th minute, he stood and observed as Swansea built an incisive move that might have yielded a goal if Ayew had not volleyed wide from 16 yards.</p> <p>Six minutes later another shot by Ayew was deflected behind by Dejan Lovren for a corner that led to the opening goal. Gylfi Sigurdsson delivered with customary accuracy and Ayew showed better timing than any visitor to head the ball into the net from close range.</p> <p>Ward, making his second league start in place of Simon Mignolet, then made an excellent save with his feet to deny Cork after another flowing move by the hosts. But Cork left the goalkeeper grasping at air in the 33rd minute when slovenliness by Liverpool allowed him to retrieve the ball in midfield and he strode forward and guided a curling shot into the net from 20 yards.</p> <p>Sheyi Ojo, an enterprising 18-year-old, tried to wake Liverpool up. In the 36th minute he released Sturridge with a canny pass from the centre circle. The England striker clipped a first-time lob over Lukasz Fabianski but just the wrong side of the post.</p> <p>Klopp could not let Liverpool continue as they were. He made two substitutions at the break, introducing Benteke and Lucas Leiva for Coutinho and Chirivella. That helped Liverpool get a slightly better grip. Benteke, a player with even more to prove than any of the tyros, made his presence felt in the 65th minute, stooping to head in a corner by Ojo. But that was not the start of a comeback, merely the prelude to more Liverpool bungling. In the 67th minute Lucas received a pass midway inside his own half and lapsed into a reverie, allowing Montero to relieve him of the ball and skip past Martin Skrtel and into the box, where slapstick defending failed to distract him. Montero looked up and picked out Ayew, who scored.</p> <p>There was still time for the afternoon to deteriorate for the visitors. Smith, booked in the first half for pulling back Routledge, was shown a second yellow card for bumping into Kyle Naughton after the defender lifted the ball over him. Klopp\u2019s reaction suggested he found the decision poor. His team\u2019s performance was worse.</p> <p>The season could yet end with smiles and a Europa League triumph. Otherwise, Liverpool fans may find themselves in the funny position of having to hope Manchester United win the FA Cup final if Anfield is to see European action next season.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Jefferson Montero (Swansea City)</p>",

Mourinho is in contact with several different clubs, including Paris Saint-Germain, regarding his next move, though the Guardian has established that the Portuguese understands that United are waiting until their season is over before making any decision about the future of Louis van Gaal. The 64-year-old could yet save his position if a top-four finish is attained.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Back in 2007, Live at Leeds started to showcase the city\u2019s homegrown talent. Now in its 10th year, it\u2019s one of the UK\u2019s best established street festivals, with 180-plus bands (compared to 2007\u2019s 54) playing at 16 venues. Attendance has also grown massively, from 1,500 to 10,500 punters pressed body-to-body in tiny bars, driving Uber price surges as they rush between distant venues in search of the next best thing. The bill is full of unknowns, but sticking a figurative pin in the map for the first band of the day works out well: ZoZo are a local five-piece with a saxophonist in their ranks. \u201cThey\u2019re not paying us, so you\u2019d better come forward,\u201d singer/guitarist Kang Clinton tells Belgrave Music Hall. It turns out that seeing the whites of Clinton\u2019s eyes is key to ZoZo\u2019s performance. They marry Protomartyr\u2019s post-apocalyptic incantations to brassy postpunk in debt to the Ex. Each member jitters as if he\u2019s short-circuiting, and Clinton\u2019s absurd, overheated gesticulations are funny and unpredictable. For the last song, he shoots across the floor like a bowling ball and disappears, leaving a random bloke to seize the mic and chant along to the frenzied music. They make midday feel like midnight. But even the best laid plans have a tendency to go awry. Late-running sets are a big problem, throwing the whole day off as you dash from one silent venue to the next. Over at Holy Trinity church, Hannah Lou Clark has a nightmare: technical issues mean her set starts 30 minutes late, then she does one track \u2013 a plaintive electric-guitar ballad \u2013 only to break a string, stall again, and end up playing just three songs. The breaking down of genre barriers means that pop-leaning acts now get a look-in at ostensibly indie festivals like this. At Headrow House, duo Girli\u2019s cyberpunk Claire\u2019s Accessories aesthetic and vocal fry affectations are meant to be subversive \u2013 they discuss periods and throw \u201cpre-bled\u201d pants into the crowd \u2013 but, unlike Kathleen Hanna\u2019s Valley Girl Intelligentsia, it all seems to be a joke at the expense of teenage girls and pop fans, rather than a provocative spin. It\u2019s a strange sign of the times that proper indie lads such as Blossoms have finally recognised the power of their teen-girl fans, and adapted accordingly. Following the 1975\u2019s lead, they embrace their floppy-haired heart-throb status at Leeds University union, and bring rolling funk and silvery synths to their robust, devotional guitar pop. There must be 2,000 people in the room; Blossoms will be massive. For all that Live at Leeds offers, there\u2019s surprisingly little grime or hip-hop. At the Brudenell, Loyle Carner provides a welcome corrective, though he has a more sentimental approach than the genre\u2019s comic, spitting mainstays. Over soulful samples, he raps about his parents and wishing for a little sister. \u201cI tell her, eat her spinach and she\u2019ll see that the skies are limitless,\u201d he imagines, with endearing wonder. Afterwards, to loud cheers, he says that his mum has just told him she\u2019s adopting a little girl. Despite logistical difficulties resulting from its size, Live at Leeds thrives in intimate moments like this.",

      "body": "<p>Back in 2007, Live at Leeds started to showcase the city\u2019s homegrown talent. Now in its 10th year, it\u2019s one of the UK\u2019s best established street festivals, with 180-plus bands (compared to 2007\u2019s 54) playing at 16 venues. Attendance has also grown massively, from 1,500 to 10,500 punters pressed body-to-body in tiny bars, driving Uber price surges as they rush between distant venues in search of the next best thing.</p> <p>The bill is full of unknowns, but sticking a figurative pin in the map for the first band of the day works out well: ZoZo are a local five-piece with a saxophonist in their ranks. \u201cThey\u2019re not paying us, so you\u2019d better come forward,\u201d singer/guitarist Kang Clinton tells Belgrave Music Hall. It turns out that seeing the whites of Clinton\u2019s eyes is key to ZoZo\u2019s performance. They marry Protomartyr\u2019s post-apocalyptic incantations to brassy postpunk in debt to the Ex. Each member jitters as if he\u2019s short-circuiting, and Clinton\u2019s absurd, overheated gesticulations are funny and unpredictable. For the last song, he shoots across the floor like a bowling ball and disappears, leaving a random bloke to seize the mic and chant along to the frenzied music. They make midday feel like midnight.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81ba0aa08a26363e3ef44888044b79e54ba62f68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81ba0aa08a26363e3ef44888044b79e54ba62f68/576_168_3303_1981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Technical problems \u2026 Hannah Lou Clark.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Technical problems \u2026 Hannah Lou Clark.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C Brandon/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But even the best laid plans have a tendency to go awry. Late-running sets are a big problem, throwing the whole day off as you dash from one silent venue to the next. Over at Holy Trinity church, Hannah Lou Clark has a nightmare: technical issues mean her set starts 30 minutes late, then she does one track \u2013 a plaintive electric-guitar ballad \u2013 only to break a string, stall again, and end up playing just three songs.</p> <p>The breaking down of genre barriers means that pop-leaning acts now get a look-in at ostensibly indie festivals like this. At Headrow House, duo Girli\u2019s cyberpunk Claire\u2019s Accessories aesthetic and vocal fry affectations are meant to be subversive \u2013 they discuss periods and throw \u201cpre-bled\u201d pants into the crowd \u2013 but, unlike Kathleen Hanna\u2019s Valley Girl Intelligentsia, it all seems to be a joke at the expense of teenage girls and pop fans, rather than a provocative spin. </p> <p>It\u2019s a strange sign of the times that proper indie lads such as Blossoms have finally recognised the power of their teen-girl fans, and adapted accordingly. Following the 1975\u2019s lead, they embrace their floppy-haired heart-throb status at Leeds University union, and bring rolling funk and silvery synths to their robust, devotional guitar pop. There must be 2,000 people in the room; Blossoms will be massive.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"697d2efc64cb0bc68907bc9fd00dc77b6d0239c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/697d2efc64cb0bc68907bc9fd00dc77b6d0239c4/225_242_2026_1216/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Endearing wonder \u2026 Loyle Carner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Endearing wonder \u2026 Loyle Carner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Waytao Shing/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all that Live at Leeds offers, there\u2019s surprisingly little grime or hip-hop. At the Brudenell, Loyle Carner provides a welcome corrective, though he has a more sentimental approach than the genre\u2019s comic, spitting mainstays. Over soulful samples, he raps about his parents and wishing for a little sister. \u201cI tell her, eat her spinach and she\u2019ll see that the skies are limitless,\u201d he imagines, with endearing wonder. Afterwards, to loud cheers, he says that his mum has just told him she\u2019s adopting a little girl. </p> <p>Despite logistical difficulties resulting from its size, Live at Leeds thrives in intimate moments like this.<br /></p>",

      "bodyText": "Recently top BBC executives have been disappearing faster than characters in BBC2 hit drama Line of Duty. Eight have gone in as many months, three of them from the newly launched BBC Studios \u2013 the new \u00a3400m venture that now houses most of the BBC\u2019s in-house shows, including hits such as Top Gear and Strictly Come Dancing. The latest to announce his departure was Mark Freeland, who was due to head up scripted comedy and drama. He quit on Thursday on the eve of the creation of BBC Studios, declaring that \u201cproposed \u2026 strategic changes \u2026 will not give me the creative platform I need to be at my very best and add maximum value to the Studios project\u201d. Coming hot on the heels of the exit of the director of BBC Studios Peter Salmon (who left in March after just eight months to join Big Brother and MasterChef makers Shine Endemol) and Wendy Darke, who was due to be head of natural history, the departures have left some of the 2,000 or so staff who officially transferred into BBC Studios on Friday feeling nervous. They question why Salmon, Darke and Freeland have quit as the BBC embarks on one of the biggest shake-ups in its 94-year history, particularly as the latter pair left despite not having jobs to go to. Whatever their reasons for leaving \u2013 and it looks as though Darke wanted to pursue other avenues, while Freeland\u2019s exit was related to structural changes Salmon\u2019s replacement Mark Linsey wants to make \u2013 it has hardly been the most auspicious start for BBC Studios. The new division came into being on Friday, almost a month later than planned due to Salmon\u2019s departure. To compound matters there are reports that the forthcoming white paper on the BBC proposes allowing independent producers to tender for more or all BBC shows, raising the prospect that even in-house hits created by the corporation, such as Top Gear or EastEnders, could one day be made by outside companies. BBC Studios is launching with around \u00a3400m of commissions, including the shows above, but if more of its returning series are tendered out to the market, some wonder how it will fare. Until next April it will still be owned by the BBC, but then it will be commercialised and have to stand on its own two feet. So has director general Tony Hall\u2019s plan to open up the corporation to competition \u2013 in exchange for being allowed to make shows for rival broadcasters \u2013 backfired? The idea started out as a way to keep the best talent at the corporation. The rise of \u201csuper-indies\u201d (and now \u201cmega-indies\u201d) as a result of the consolidation of TV\u2019s independent production sector over the last couple of decades has seen some of those who had the best ideas leave in-house production to make more money. By moving those who work in key areas, such as drama, entertainment and natural history, out of the public and into the private sector, giving them free rein to pursue commissions from other channels (and removing their more competitive salaries and expenses from prying eyes), Hall hopes to renew creativity at the BBC. But being allowed to do that came at a price. In exchange, a deal was struck with producers\u2019 alliance Pact to open up \u201ca minimum amount of 40%\u201d of its programmes to tender over the next two years \u2013 potentially slicing around \u00a3160m off BBC Studios\u2019 bottom line. Bectu general secretary Gerry Morrissey says the union fears the government will go further: \u201cThe BBC has opened up a can of worms and they\u2019ve now got no control over it. We think this is a huge own goal for the corporation. BBC production is the crown jewels of the BBC.\u201d He points out that the organisation faces the prospect of having to pay for free licence fees for over-75s, and its income stream could be further cut if more shows are put up for grabs by the white paper. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not what they [the BBC] intended,\u201d says Morrissey. \u201cBut they left the door ajar and the government\u2019s kicking it open.\u201d Pact chief executive John McVay argues the move makes the corporation and the market more competitive: \u201cWe\u2019ve made it clear we\u2019ve done a deal with BBC Studios and we think it frees competition up, which means the best programmes are made regardless of who makes them. It\u2019s up to the government to take a view.\u201d But there is also still uncertainty about the future ownership of BBC Studios. The BBC has not yet revealed how it will be protected from being sold off once it is privatised (as has happened to other BBC subsidiaries), although a meeting is scheduled with Bectu in June to discuss the issue and protect its staff\u2019s entitlements. Complicating matters, the corporation will also, from this week, have to keep separate any costs, such as for HR or IT, that are shared between BBC Studios and the rest of the publicly-owned parts of the corporation. Otherwise it could fall foul of fair trade and state aid rules. A recent corporation staff survey by Bectu showed that almost 70% think that the creation of BBC Studios will \u201cnot be in the long-term interests of licence fee payers or value for money\u201d. And 64% \u201cdo not think that BBC Studios\u2019 management has any idea what they are doing\u201d, with just 8% agreeing \u201cmanagement know what they are doing\u201d. It is unlikely that Freeland and Darke\u2019s departures will be the last, as other executives may decide the commercial BBC is not for them. But, as one BBC insider says: \u201cBBC Studios has got to be fit for purpose. And have the right people in place to be competitive. Some people may come back from the independent sector.\u201d As one producer puts it: \u201cThe BBC has bet the farm and so far ended up in the shit. But it\u2019s getting 2,000 staff off its books, and with all these departures at least its overheads are going down.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "I was chatting with a friend recently \u2013 a&nbsp;successful actor who does abortion-rights advocacy on the side \u2013 about a big pro-choice fundraiser she\u2019s currently orchestrating. It was past midnight at her house, but she was still up, still working, clacking away at her laptop, tying up loose ends, pushing ticket sales, gathering auction items \u2013 her \u201cside\u201d project looking suspiciously like a second full-time job. \u201cYou\u2019re a hero,\u201d I said. \u201cNo, I am not,\u201d she snapped, vehement. \u201cSomebody\u2019s got to do it. It\u2019s a fucking embarrassment that I have to.\u201d She was right. \u201cOur country is a septic tank,\u201d I&nbsp;sighed. \u201cOn fire.\u201d \u201cFull-on fail.\u201d I still think that choosing to take on the exhausting, sisyphean, largely thankless work of abortion advocacy (we are not taught to say \u201cthank you\u201d for abortion; we are taught to never speak of it at all) is heroic. She could choose to leave that work to others, but she doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s&nbsp;significant. But that reaction \u2013 somebody\u2019s got to do it, so I&nbsp;do \u2013 triggered a familiar weariness in me. We shouldn\u2019t have to spend our spare time working,&nbsp;pro bono, to remove stigma from a&nbsp;procedure so common that a full third of the women you know have had one; or to raise money to help impoverished pregnant people travel hundreds of miles, to other states, to exercise a legal right; or to convince a supposedly free and enlightened nation, in 2016, that people with uteruses are autonomous human beings deserving of basic medical care. Each of these things should be a given, and we\u2019ve been having this conversation since before my grandmother was born, so why are we still talking about it now? When will the \u201cdebate\u201d end so that women can finally be fully invested in their work and passions and lives? It was when I sat down to write about Donald Trump\u2019s statement \u2013 he said: \u201cFrankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I&nbsp;don\u2019t think she\u2019d get 5% of the vote. The&nbsp;only thing she\u2019s got going is the women\u2019s card\u201d \u2013 that I realised: it\u2019s the same&nbsp;thing. How many times do feminists have to deconstruct and debunk the notion of the \u201cwoman card\u201d? How many rounds are we going to go this time? How many thinkpieces do we need before society accepts that sexism is real and we can move on to the far more important work of repairing the damage it has caused? The next time some rightwing dillweed drops a turd like \u201cwoman card\u201d, will anyone remember that women have already done this labour? Or will we just have to do it all over again? What a tremendous, tedious, pointless drain on our time and energy. Imagine what we could accomplish if we were just allowed to do our jobs. I hate this election. Everything about it makes me miserable. Donald Trump. Donald Trump\u2019s fans. Twitter. Abortion. Xenophobia. That thing on Ted Cruz\u2019s lip. The opinions in Ted Cruz\u2019s brain. Walls. Refugees. Four hundred and ninety-seven thousand debates. My Bernie friends yelling at my Hillary friends. My Hillary friends&nbsp;yelling at my Bernie friends. Straight white men insisting that identity politics have no value. The random dude who yelled at me for tweeting that I liked that little bird that landed on Bernie Sanders\u2019s podium, because he thought it sounded like I&nbsp;liked the bird better than Bernie, and none shall besmirch the honour of the Bern on Trevor\u2019s watch. (\u201cI get it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a vagina.\u201d) But maybe what I hate the most about this election is thinking about all the goddamn writing&nbsp;I\u2019m going to have to do for the next four (or, potentially, eight) years if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency. Misogynist rhetoric is going&nbsp;to&nbsp;reach levels of frenzy heretofore unknown to science, and with misogynist rhetoric comes feminist outcry, and with feminist outcry comes dopey faux-confusion: \u201cI don\u2019t get why this is sexist. Explain it to me. Debate with me. Help me. Convince me.\u201d There is no sense of memory, of the fact that all of this has been explained many, many times before. Because why would they want to remember?

      "body": "<p>I was chatting with a friend recently \u2013 a\u00a0successful actor who does abortion-rights advocacy on the side \u2013 about a big pro-choice fundraiser she\u2019s currently orchestrating. It was past midnight at her house, but she was still up, still working, clacking away at her laptop, tying up loose ends, pushing ticket sales, gathering auction items \u2013 her \u201cside\u201d project looking suspiciously like a second full-time job.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hero,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I am not,\u201d she snapped, vehement. \u201cSomebody\u2019s got to do it. It\u2019s a fucking embarrassment that I have to.\u201d</p> <p>She was right. \u201cOur country is a septic tank,\u201d I\u00a0sighed. \u201cOn fire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFull-on fail.\u201d</p> <p>I still think that choosing to take on the exhausting, sisyphean, largely thankless work of abortion advocacy (we are not taught to say \u201cthank you\u201d for abortion; we are taught to never speak of it at all) is heroic. She could choose to leave that work to others, but she doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s\u00a0significant.</p> <p>But that reaction \u2013 somebody\u2019s got to do it, so I\u00a0do \u2013 triggered a familiar weariness in me. We shouldn\u2019t have to spend our spare time working,\u00a0pro bono, to remove stigma from a\u00a0procedure so common that <a href=\"http://www.1in3campaign.org/\" title=\"\">a full third of the women you know have had one</a>; or to raise money to help impoverished pregnant people travel hundreds of miles, to other states, to exercise a legal right; or to convince a supposedly free and enlightened nation, in 2016, that people with uteruses are autonomous human beings deserving of basic medical care. Each of these things should be a given, and we\u2019ve been having this conversation since before my grandmother was born, so why are we still talking about it now? When will the \u201cdebate\u201d end so that women can finally be fully invested in their work and passions and lives?</p> <p>It was when I sat down to write about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/28/donald-trump-women-voters-poll-republican\" title=\"\">Donald Trump\u2019s statement</a> \u2013 he said: \u201cFrankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I\u00a0don\u2019t think she\u2019d get 5% of the vote. The\u00a0only thing she\u2019s got going is the women\u2019s card\u201d \u2013 that I realised: it\u2019s the same\u00a0thing. How many times do feminists have to deconstruct and debunk the notion of the \u201cwoman card\u201d? How many rounds are we going to go this time? How many thinkpieces do we need before society accepts that sexism is real and we can move on to the far more important work of repairing the damage it has caused? The next time some rightwing dillweed drops a turd like \u201cwoman card\u201d, will anyone remember that women have already done this labour? Or will we just have to do it all over again?</p> <p>What a tremendous, tedious, pointless drain on our time and energy. Imagine what we could accomplish if we were just allowed to do our jobs.</p> <p>I hate this election. Everything about it makes me miserable. Donald Trump. Donald Trump\u2019s fans. Twitter. Abortion. Xenophobia. That thing on Ted Cruz\u2019s lip. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/29/ted-cruz-is-lucifer-in-the-flesh-says-former-speaker-john-boehner\" title=\"\">The opinions in Ted Cruz\u2019s brain</a>.

      "bodyText": "Read Paul Doyle\u2019s match report from Swansea: Anyway, thanks all for your company - bye. Well, Swansea played very well indeed. They set the tone early, snapping into tackles and attacking intelligently and in numbers. Then, when Liverpool threatened a comeback, they responded almost immediately; they cannot now be relegated. As for Liverpool, consult next Thursday night for a verdict. 90+3 min The away end is not full. Hard to argue with that one. 90+2 min So, if you\u2019re Klopp, how do you respond to this effort? On the one hand, a few smacked bottoms would be fair enough, on the other, why give out for a flat effort when there\u2019s a crucial game imminent? 90+1 min Brittan goes off and Fulton comes on. 90 min Swansea are enjoying this, fizzing the ball about as Ayew seeks his hat-trick. There shall be four added minutes. 90 min Time is elapsing. 88 min Steve McManaman gives Andre Ayew the man-of-the-match award, which is well deserved though still slightly harsh on Jack Cork, who set the tone for the afternoon. But it then transpires that Ayew\u2019s wife had a baby last week, and, as far as I can see, he refrained from the rocking celebration - which makes the bubbly all his. 87 min Swansea knock it along the back-four like Liverpool circa 1984, and the crowd cheer. 85 min Swansea are seeking more goals, and Sigurdsson has another belt from distance, this time finding Ward\u2019s midriff - he\u2019s had a very presentable afternoon. 83 min Martin Skrtel\u2019s head is not made of head. Sigurdsson absolutely panels one from outside the box and he simply bumps it away like it\u2019s nothing, which it was not. 82 min More rueful smiling from Klopp. I wonder what he means by it. 81 min For Howard Webb, that Sturridge penalty appeal wasn\u2019t a penalty, for him. 80 min Change for Liverpool: Brannagan replaces Ibe, who\u2019s had better days. 78 min Swansea win a corner down the left and the ball scooshes across the box, playing Sturridge\u2019s arm off the turf. As the penalty appeals ring out, Rangel slaps a shot at goal that hits the stanchion and ripples the side-netting,deceiving the commentary team, never mind the crowd. Good effort. 77 min Skrtel dives in on Sigurdsson, knocks him over, and is duly booked. He misjudges the flight and bounce of the ball so that when a leaping Ayew nicks it away from him, he\u2019s already committed to the foul. 75 min Sturridge, who has not made his selection for Villarreal an automatic one, weaves away from Brittan, his cross deflected behind. The corner comes to nothing, and so too does the next one, fisted clear by Fabianski. 73 min Ojo allows the ball to run across him onto his left foot and moves away from Rangel, who barges through him accordingly. He\u2019s booked. 73 min Montero departs - Clyne will be enjoying that more than most - and Naughton replces him. 71 min Ayew has been excellent this afternoon and he takes a pass from Cork on the half-turn, looking to feed Routledge in the same movement. He can\u2019t, but it was a nice idea. 69 min Liverpool are searching for the heroes inside themselves. What a glorious mess this is! After Lucas loses possession Montero races at Skrtel, twisting him inside and out before Clyne intercedes. But despite the presence of 43,865 defenders in the box Liverpool can\u2019t clear, and Montero retrieves the ball down the left of the box to cross. Somehow, Ayew reaches it first and swivels hard to scuff a drill and drill a scuff past Ward. That, you would posit, is in close proximity to that. 66 min Can Swansea raise it again? Simple, again. The corner finds Benteke around the penalty spot, Sigurdsson already lost in a risible mismatch, and with Stewart also chasing it, he heads firmly past Fabianski and into the corner. 63 min Better from Liverpool, Clyne breaking forward and finding Sturridge inside the box, who lays off a return. As he forces himself towards the ball, Taylor inserts himself into the race and slides it behind for a corner, studding Fabianski\u2019s face in the process. There\u2019s a break while he receives treatment. 62 min Lovely play by Rangel skipping forward and finding Routledge, who lifts the ball over Lovren and scoots around him to collect before the offside Ayew can intervene. But the attack is crowded out, after which ire is dispensed towards the ref for failing to penalise Ayew. 60 min Adam Lallana is warming up along the touchline. 58 min Lucas turns quickly and passes forwards, the ball finding its way to Ojo on the left. His cross is a decent one, and Benteke reckons he\u2019s pulled back by Amat as Taylor sidefoots firmly at his own goal - and just wide. At the corner, there\u2019s the usual skullduggery from both attackers and defenders, the free-kick awarded to the latter for an offence not entirely obviously on first or second glance. 58 min Not much going on, which is kind of the problem with this 4-4-2 Liverpool are at. There\u2019s not much movement between the lines, meaning it\u2019s tricky to find space and disconcert defenders. 56 min Ojo runs at Rangel and drills a cross into his shins, winning a corner; it\u2019s useless, and headed clear before the it so much as reaches the front post. 55 min Swansea are largely sitting back now, allowing Liverpool to knock it about from side to side and in front of them. 53 min This is already much better from Liverpool, who are trying and all sorts. Ibe races around two players along the right touchline, hits a cross against one, then the other, and is vexed when it bounces out of play and the throw-in goes against him. 51 min Lovren reaches a ball ahead of Ayew and leaves him first limping, then lying. Eventually, Klopp instructs his players to find toch and we see an inadvertent foot-stomp - a sair yin, no mistake, but not one that needed the play stopped. 50 min Sturridge accepts possession inside the centre-circle and seeking Ojo, floats a square ball behind him and into touch. He looks suitably sheepish. 49 min Liverpool knock it around in midfield - to no end, but it\u2019s an improvement of sorts. 48 min Physics appears to have taken hold - the rain means that the ball is dragging more than zipping now. This is not going to be pretty. 46 min That must\u2019ve been a tricky one for Klopp - Countinho played so badly that he deserves to trudge through a further 45 minutes, but, on the other hand, he\u2019s got things to do on Thursday. Anyway, looks like Liverpool are now playing a 4-4-2. 46 min Liverpool make two changes: Chirivella and Coutinho are relieved, with Lucas and Benteke pressed into service. \u201cArabic version of White Rabbit from the American Hustle soundtrack,\u201d emails Steven Wyatt: While you wait: Swansea have been as good as Liverpool have been abject, strong in the tackle and enterprising in attack with Cork, Montero and Ayew standing out. Klopp being Klopp, expect him to make changes and go for it after the break. 45 min There shall be a single, solitary additional minute. 44 min Coutinho seems, finally, to have reconciled his status with his presence on the pitch, and a sharp turn away from Brittan wins a free-kick just outside the D, just left of centre. He and Sturridge wait behind the ball, and the latter slams a miserable effort well over the top. Klopp enjoys more rueful laughter, and Benteke looks to be getting ready for a second half appearance. 43 min So, does Klopp try and win the game by sending on players he\u2019s keeping for Thursday - because that\u2019s what he\u2019ll need to do - or does he accept defeat right about now? Not a great choice, that. 42 min Ibe, who\u2019s barely featured, is given time on the ball and moving from left to centre, rolls square to Coutinho. He shoots hard, and Taylor deflects behind - the corner comes to nothing. 40 min Chirivella finds Stewart, who passes the ball around his heel, fooling Cork who fouls him. That\u2019s a booking. 38 min Montero is giving Clyne a difficult afternoon, and when he and Chirivella are beaten in quick succession, he slides in to earn a booking. Taylor\u2019s ball in is useless, but Liverpool don\u2019t get it away and a further cross comes in. This time, Skrtel heads clear, and Montero is there again, meeting it with an overhead kick that Ayew tries flicking on. He misses, and Ward seizes. 37 min Sturridge is in the game now, and on the half-turn clips an effort from outside the box that Fabianski grabs easily. But things may be changing. 36 min And Sturridge almost responds with an even better goal! Ojo rauns across midfield and slides through a pass that puts his man in a race with Amat. He wins it, easily, and lifts a delectable chip over Fabianski - it looks for all the world as though it\u2019s in, but drifts and pitches just wide. Liverpool may just have woken up. 35 min Liverpool have been shambolic so far, with the notable exception of Ward. Liverpool lose the ball just by the centre-circle - it\u2019s bouncing and Coutinho simply isn\u2019t arsed. Cork, on the other hand, is, and bursts through midfield before, just outside the box, just left of centre, using Lovren as a screen to powerdraw a curler into the far corner, three-quarters of the way up. Fantastic goal from the game\u2019s dominant force. 31 min Swansea have had 72% of the possession and Liverpool are doing well to be only one behind. 28 min Klopp is grinning ruefully - there might be some heavy metal tea-cup chucking in the changing room at half-time. And there\u2019s the Jefferson Airplane again, haring through at inside-left when Chirivella loses possession - he feints to go inside Lovren, fires in a low shot with his toe that Ward does well to save. 23 min A favourite and now topical football photo 26 min Smith loses Routledge and pulls him back - he\u2019s booked. And from the ensuing free-kick, just outside the box down its right side, Sigurdsson places the ball on Amat\u2019s head, about three yards out. But, somehow, he contrives to get underneath it and power a header over the bar! Strange behaviour. 25 min More excellence from Swansea as Montero nashes down the left and cuts back a sorely tempting cross for Sigurdsson, who thunks a drive at goal. But Ward does superbly to save with his feet, diving the wrong way. Simple but brilliant. Sigurdsson drills over a flat, low corner and Ayew, losing Sturridge and charging at Lovren, headbutts powerfully past Ward. Swansea have earned that. 20 min A Liverpool attack breaks down and Swansea break through Montero, on the left touchline and lifting a delicious ball into midfield. Another astute pass from Cork then finds Routledge, who does superbly to play in Ayew. He\u2019s about to shoot - and does - but Lovren is right over the deflect behind for a corner, 19 min Britton and Cork are showing Chirivella and Stewart at the moment. 17 min Taylor fires the ball into Ayew and Skrtel extends a leg around him to intercept. But Ayew falls over and the ref deduces a foul, the free-kick 40 yards out left of centre. It\u2019s underhit and headed clear, but Swansea come again, and a Cruyff turn from Cork just inside the box almost slips Ayew through. 16 min The aforementioned Klopp will not be enjoying this - his team have done almost nothing so far. 14 min Sturridge dallies in possession and Swansea pinch it from him to launch a break. In the end, Ayew leathers a shot over the bar when he ought to have done better, but that\u2019s Jurgen Klopps\u2019 preference for Divock Origi right there. 13 min Coutinho messes about outside his own box and is duly nailed by the excellent Cork, who transfers possession towards Ayew. He whips over a dangerous cross from the left, forcing Smith to hip behind. The corner comes to nowt. 12 min The rain is tipping down now - the helpful sheen will soon become unhelpful drag. A favourite footballing downpour: 10 min Smith finds Ibe who cuts into the box and stubs a cross at Sturridge. The ball is nip-high, more or less, and he swivels well to hook goalwards - but with toe not laces, enough to send the effort wide. 9 min Smith slides in on Routledge with studs up and control lacking; Roger East deems it worthy of nothing but a free-kick. That\u2019s Roger East no red cards so far this season, Roger East. 8 min \u201cI am bound to take issue with that sign indicating the kick off time of this fixture,\u201d emails Roy Allen. \u201c12 noon is, by definition, neither am nor pm. What is the world coming to? (If you print this I\u2019ll know it\u2019s a really terrible game.)\u201c Me, telt. I\u2019d always thought that it was a.m. when it\u2019s dark and p.m. when it\u2019s light. 6 min Liverpool have barely strung two passes together. 4 min Again, Rangel hits Montero, and this time he catches up with the ball and arriving on the edge of the box, has two men to his left - he finds neither. But Swansea look a threat, and if they can find a reliable striker for next season - not easy, granted - they\u2019ll do a lot better. 3 min Good stat from Darren Fletcher: with an average age of 23 years and 218 days, this is the youngest starting XI in Liverpool\u2019s history. 1 min Rangel lifts a ball down the touchline for Routledge, but it kicks off the turf and hurries on over the by-line. 1 min There\u2019s a lovely, footballing rain at the Liberty as Liverpool kick-off. Swansea have laid a wreath on the centre-spot in tribute to those killed at Hillsborough, and the crowd now honour the heroism of the families who finally achieved justice. The players are waiting to emerge, Liverpool led by captain for the day and Primal Scream devotee, Mrtn Skrtl. Get to grips with Sheyi Ojo. He looks a proper talent. Brilliant meaningless games (2): West Brom 5-5 Man United 5 Jurgen Klopp is excited by his young players - in particular by Cameron Brannagan, who is on the bench. He feigns amazement that the various selection and non-selection of Daniel Sturridge should be a topic for discussion - his growing disdain for obligatory interviews should be a pleasure to watch. Brilliant meaningless games: France v Belgium, third place play-off, Mexico \u201886 So, back to the teams: Swansea make two changes from last week\u2019s hiding at lowly Leicester. At the back, Amat replaces Fernandez, and in midfield, Montero comes in for the injured Fer; Gomis is back on the bench. Liverpool, meanwhile, make eight alterations following their defeat in Villarreal. Most interestingly, Kevin Stewart and Pedro Chirivella anchor their midfield, while in front of them, Coutinho, Ojo and Ibe offer pace, trickery, imagination and movement. BREAKING NEWS: Michael Owen has had a haircut. More as I get it. You will of course note that Liverpool have but six subs - Connor Randall was ruled out this morning after succumbing to a virus. And here are our teams... Swansea City (4-2-3-1, blatantly): Fabianski; Rangel, Amat, Williams, Taylor; Britton, Cork; Routledge, Sigurdsson, Montero; Ayew. Subs: Nordfeldt, Naughton, Fernandez, Ki, Fulton, Barrow, Gomis. Liverpool (4-2-3-1, obviously): Ward; Clyne, Skrtel, Lovren, Smith; Stewart, Chirivella; Ibe, Coutinho, Ojo; Sturridge. Subs: Mignolet, Benteke, Lallana, Lucas, Brannagan, Teixeira. Receptacle for misdirected fury and blame: Roger East Hello, good morning, and welcome to the merry month of May - or silent bum time as it\u2019s known by the unfortunate majority. Swansea are staying up, Liverpool want the Europa League, here\u2019s a meaningless game of football to encroach on the weekends of all concerned. Well, that\u2019s one way of looking at it - but fear not, there is another, correcter one. First of all, it is a scientific fact no game of football is ever meaningless, but in any case, import and excitement rarely correlate. So, Swansea are under no pressure whatsoever, able simply to enjoy themselves, and Liverpool have players keen to be involved in Thursday\u2019s return against Villarreal - in particular, the most talented amongst them, Daniel Sturridge. Eyes down for a thriller. Kick-off: 12pm BST",

That word is \u201cmugs\u201d. In a previous life as a betting shop cashier, one of the more difficult tasks associated with the job involved maintaining a straight face on the rare occasions someone handed over a slip on which they had forecast a sporting event so preposterously unlikely that, far from raising a quizzical eyebrow, one\u2019s immediate compulsion was to burst out laughing in the customer\u2019s face. Such a disrespectful reaction was considered inappropriate and frowned on by senior management, who have always held these mug punters in the highest of regard for reasons that almost certainly do not need to be explained here. This season, however, some of the mugs are fighting back. Or so we are told. In a couple of years working as a well-known high-street bookie\u2019s cashier, I do not recall ever taking a bet on any team, let alone a team of 5,000-1 rank outsiders, to win the Premier League. My experience of studying the psychology of betting shop patrons from behind the counter across which they so willingly pass their money is these people tend to prefer a quick fix and generally prefer a wager on events that offer the potential of a far quicker return than a football season with a gestation period of nine months. Why wait, when trap No2 in the second race at Romford dogs can win or lose in less than 30 seconds? In recent months, however, it has become apparent a more patient breed of punter exists. Their stories have been well documented, invariably sent out into the ether by the press departments of publicity-hungry bookies. They are the men \u2013 and they are always men \u2013 who for reasons best known to themselves around nine months ago, decided to bet on 5,000-1 outsiders Leicester City to win the Premier League. There is a certain poignant irony then, that when it became increasingly apparent this was exactly what may happen and these people were confronted with the prospect of winning unimaginable, life-changing amounts of money, many of them got twitchy, ran out of patience and lost whatever blind faith it was that had prompted them to take a punt on Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side in the first place. In March, one Leicester fan from Warwickshire cashed out his golden ticket, worth a potential \u00a3250,000, for \u00a372,000 offered to him by Ladbrokes, with whom he had struck his \u00a350 bet. \u201cIt will mean so much if we win, so there\u2019s no point in being greedy,\u201d said the man, who wished to remain anonymous and may well now wish he had held his nerve for a bit longer. \u201cIt\u2019s a life-changing amount of money and we congratulate our customer for holding his nerve this long,\u201d said a Ladbrokes spokeswoman, her unspoken caveat presumably being that, in the hands of the kind of person who thinks little of betting \u00a350 on a 5,000-1 long shot, \u00a372,000 may not last very long. Of course, this is not to say our anonymous friend from Warwickshire will hand back Ladbrokes their \u00a372,000 in instalments, as they almost certainly hope he will. There could be any number of reasons, rational or sentimental, why he thought betting \u00a350 on Leicester City to win the league was a shrewd investment, although it is almost certain not one involved the kind of thought process that might have compelled any sensible English football fan to say to themselves last August: \u201cYou know, I genuinely think Leicester City might win the Premier League.\u201d Having said that, last week the story emerged of one Leicester fan, Leigh Herbert, who did exactly that although he was game enough to concede he had been drunk in a field in Cornwall at the time. \u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t think they would win it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut my heart wanted them to, just like every fan with their own team.\u201d As his team\u2019s star striker discovered to his considerable embarrassment last year, the combination of alcohol and gambling can often result in extremely poor judgment and have regrettable consequences but Herbert got exceptionally lucky. Tom Hanks is another man possibly set for a much-needed bumper payday, having apparently put \u00a3100 on the Foxes. Industry reports suggest bookmakers are facing a \u00a320m payout in the almost inevitable event of Leicester being crowned champions and, as is customary, they will cry crocodile tears of self-pity while milking their misfortune for every possible drop of available publicity. As everyone loves an unlikely winner, what they almost certainly will not mention is how much they raked in from the kind of people who support other teams and bet their money on different long shots. Amid all the jubilation surrounding Leicester, tales of the inevitable optimists and fruitcakes who bet on Aston Villa or Newcastle to top the table have been few and far between. It seems they are almost certainly out there but their stories have gone untold.",

    "webTitle": "John RWD Jones obituary", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The human rights barrister John RWD Jones devoted himself to helping those in peril in the courts. He was a leading architect of the nascent system of international criminal trials, and in those trials he was the best of defence counsel for the worst of defendants: those accused of atrocities. He has died at the age of 48, after being struck by a train at West Hampstead station, north London, and an inquest has yet to be held. It was at the United Nation\u2019s special court for Sierra Leone in 2003 that John made his first permanent mark. I had been concerned, as its first president, that international justice had, ever since, and including, the Nuremberg trials after the second world war, been delivered by courts which had an in-built bias towards the prosecutor: equality of arms required a defender. John was appointed to head the new Sierra Leone special court defence office, and his dedicated work not only proved that such an office was necessary in the interests of fairness, but ensured that it would be replicated in other courts \u2013 including the new international criminal court (the ICC) in The Hague, where hearings started in 2006. Last year, John represented one Sierra Leone convict \u2013 the former president of Liberia Charles Taylor \u2013 now serving a 50-year sentence in a British prison, in an attempt to have him transferred to a jail in Africa. John\u2019s academic excellence enabled him to preach what he practised: he wrote a textbook with Antonio Cassese, a founding father of international criminal law, who in 1993 had become president of the war crimes court for the former Yugoslavia (the ICTY). The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court: A Commentary (2002) examines the institution\u2019s legal basis; International Criminal Practice (1998, third edition 2003), written with his friend and colleague Steven Powles, analyses the operation of the various courts and tribunals. With his wife, the Slovenian lawyer Mi\u0161a Zgonec-Ro\u017eej, John wrote an important article on the rights of suspects for Amal Clooney\u2019s book The Special Tribunal for Lebanon (2014). In 2005 John joined Doughty Street Chambers, where he specialised in extradition law and served as a part-time immigration judge. He appeared for governments as well as for potential extraditees, and earned praise from judges for the fairness of his approach. Throughout his legal life his scholarship enabled him to intellectualise what he was doing daily in the forensic arena: he produced the valuable Extradition and Mutual Legal Assistance Handbook (2005, second edition 2010). He appeared in a number of leading extradition cases, including a supreme court decision about the needs of vulnerable children caught up in the process. He was a member of the team acting for Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder confined to the Ecuadorian embassy in London pending the resolution of an extradition application by Sweden, and it was his submissions that persuaded the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention this year to rule (much to the annoyance of the UK government and newspaper editorials) that Assange was being wrongfully detained. John was appointed QC in 2013, and worked full time at the Hague from the following year as resident director of Doughty Street International. He represented some of the most demonised (and, it must be said, a few of the most demonic) defendants, always putting up the legal arguments they were entitled to make and thus ensuring that justice upon them would be seen to be done. He appeared for Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and the Libyan spymaster Abdullah al-Senussi, mastermind of some of the worst crimes of the Gaddafi era, in appeals to have them tried for crimes against humanity by the ICC, which cannot pass a death sentence, rather than lynch-law Libyan tribunals. Born in Wimbledon, south-west London, John was the son of Dr Hugh Jones and his wife, Margaret. From the independent sixth-form college Mander Portman Woodward, London, he went to study philosophy, politics and economics at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, and took master\u2019s degrees in law at City University, London, and George Washington University, in the US capital. He was called to the bar at Lincoln\u2019s Inn in 1992. It was at The Hague, as a legal officer for the ICTY (1995-99) that his special ability was first recognised by Cassese. He engaged John to help draft the ICTY\u2019s rules of evidence and procedure, and then in 1998 dispatched him to Arusha, in northern Tanzania, to do likewise for the ICTR, the court set up to punish the perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide. John usually acted in death penalty and other deserving cases free of charge. He gave time unstintingly to mentor young lawyers and to assist colleagues with creative arguments in his specialities. His advocacy was fluent and unflappable, his scholarship unimpeachable and his sense of humour always intact. From 2008, he served as a trustee of the Orangutan Protection Foundation. He is survived by Mi\u0161a, his sons, Patrick and Zachary, his sister, Anne, and his parents. \u2022 John Richard William Day Jones, barrister, born 14 June 1967; died 18 April 2016",

So on that front director general Tony Hall\u2019s big test is almost over. Far more testing and potentially significant for the BBC in the longer term, and what everyone at the BBC is talking about internally, however, are Hall\u2019s plans for a very major reorganisation of the whole structure of the BBC. TV and Radio directorates will disappear to be replaced with three new \u201ccontent focused\u201d divisions \u2013 loosely titled Inform, Educate and Entertain. Content commissioning along with TV and radio channels will be spread out amongst the three divisions, based on which they\u2019re thought to fit best. So news and Radio 5 Live into Inform, BBC1, drama, entertainment, comedy, Radios 1, 2 and BBC3 into Entertain, and documentaries, factual, Radio 4 \u2013 or at least those bits of it that haven\u2019t been snaffled by Entertain \u2013 into Educate. With the three divisions overseen by an all-powerful director of content. All in the name of preparing the BBC for the fully converged digital world where content, as opposed to delivery platforms, really is king. In fact this is not in principle a new idea at all. BBC strategists have been developing plans for something like this for literally decades. Greg Dyke adopted some of it, giving more power to genre commissioning heads as opposed to TV channel controllers in the belief that only they would have the \u201cbig picture\u201d for content in a converging world. Mark Thompson who followed him \u2013 and who was the only DG to have run a major TV channel \u2013 backed away from advancing further down Dyke\u2019s path, believing it was way too far ahead of where audiences actually were in their consumption of BBC services, and thus allowed the traditional TV and radio channels to reassert their creative dominance. George Entwistle, however, was completely committed to breaking up TV and Radio and I remember being briefed by him on his plans. Sadly for him he didn\u2019t get a chance to even begin to implement them. Which brings us to Hall and the closest the BBC\u2019s strategy civil service (as one very senior executive described them) have ever got to the fulfilment of their digital dream. Trouble is, though, that while they might look great in the obligatory power-point presentations, these plans are riddled with profound operational difficulties \u2013 many of which bring with them, once people understand what\u2019s at stake, the potential for huge public rows. So much so that the announcement of the scheme has been postponed at least twice and is now not due to take place until after the white paper is published later this month. For a start dismantling the traditional directorates overseeing TV and Radio is genuinely fraught with risk, once you realise how they work. To the strategist they just look like dinosaurs from a bygone age fixated on all the wrong things. In reality however the BBC\u2019s quality control functions, which guarantee the quality of its output, are absolutely plugged into those channel structures. Who will do that and with what lines of accountability? Secondly, given that all the mainstream TV channels and most of the radio stations run content that might be thought of as coming from all three of the new directorates, where does the overview function currently exercised by the channels and their controllers overseen by the TV and Radio directorates sit? And thirdly where does the audience fit into all this, given that consumption of BBC content is still overwhelmingly via traditional channels? The potential failure to grasp the importance of channel controllers to the BBC\u2019s communication with the viewing/listening public is completely wrong-headed. They need looking after and nurturing, and channels need to be coordinated as well as competitive with each other. All of which is currently done by the TV and Radio directorates which will no longer exist. These are the sorts of critical operational details that high-level strategists (and their bean-counter chums in finance and HR who just love the idea of breaking up \u201cobstructive\u201d traditional baronies) tend not to see. This is a plan that raises many more questions \u2013 big and important ones \u2013 than answers and currently looks (from the inside at least) to be very far from fully thought-through. Some talented senior executives have already left and others are preparing to follow them. In fact it is little short of playing with fire and will most likely create far more serious and far-reaching difficulties than the government or its white paper.",

John Zylinski is expected to endorse Goldsmith for the election on Thursday at a Trafalgar Square rally on Monday. Although Zylinski is a marginal figure in the race, his support for the Tory MP is likely to help him as he he attempts to win over an estimated 100,000 Polish voters in the capital. While critical of the Tory and Labour frontrunners in the race, Zylinski had been particularly scathing of Goldsmith, who he said had \u201cno real achievements in life apart from inheriting \u00a3300m and running an ecology magazine\u201d. But Zylinski, a prince whose family were uprooted by the communist government and fled to Britain during the second world war, said he was urging Polish voters in London to give their second preference vote to Goldsmith. Zylinski, who last year challenged Ukip leader Nigel Farage to a sword duel, has released a statement from Goldsmith\u2019s campaign director, Mark Fullbrook, supporting calls for a memorial to commemorate Polish pilots who fought in the Battle of Britain, as well as the Saturday school funding. It added: \u201c[Goldsmith] is also aware of the importance to the Polish community that Saturday schools play and will use his powers as London mayor to secure more funding to these so that Polish children across London can continue to learn about their country\u2019s language, culture and history.\u201d Goldsmith\u2019s campaign has been focusing on targeting various London communities, often with specifically tailored mailshots, although he rejected accusations that he has engaged in \u201cdog-whistle politics\u201d against his Labour opponent Sadiq Khan by seeking to link him with extremism and Labour\u2019s anti-semitism row.",

    "webTitle": "The golden age of investing is over: get used to Wall Street's 'new normal'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a question that has haunted the minds of high-flying financiers, self-help authors and regular Americans for decades: what\u2019s the best way to make money investing? In the past, the best way, hands down, was to have won the genetic lot: to have been born so that your peak earning and investing years coincided with a bull market. If you came of age in the early 1980s and started investing, you\u2019ve already won the game. Those years saw an extraordinary bull market in the bond market, and the three decades since included what became a golden age for stock market investors. Sure, the stock market\u2019s path was a bumpy one, with downturns, mini-crashes and other more serious bursts, like of the dotcom bubble in 2000. Overall, however, returns greatly exceeded historical averages, and recessions cleared the way for the market to climb to greater heights. Consulting company McKinsey is now warning us that the factors that contributed to those golden age returns don\u2019t exist any more. But the era lasted long enough to make Americans think of it as normal, and to leave us wondering about what feels like an \u201cabnormal\u201d environment of volatile markets and mediocre returns. That, the McKinsey analysts argue in a new report making waves throughout the investment world, is precisely the wrong way to look at the whole matter. It was those abnormally high returns that were unusual, they point out. Now we\u2019re heading into a period of compressed or collapsing investment returns, and we\u2019ll need to adjust all our expectations and behavior accordingly. The McKinsey study attributes the exceptional returns to four unusual factors. A sharp decline in US inflation rates, to well below their historic average, led to a rise in the price that investors were willing to pay for every dollar of corporate earnings, or the much-discussed price/earnings ratio. A steep drop in interest rates boosted returns from bonds and also helped buoy stock prices. While global GDP growth was normal during the golden era, the researchers found that demographics in emerging markets and improving productivity worldwide boosted corporate profits and revenues, and contributed to stock market returns. Then there\u2019s the unprecedented surge in corporate profits in the last three decades: US companies never had it so good. These factors are gone. It\u2019s time to brace for a period in which investment returns could be lower than long-term averages. Between 1985 and 2014, the US stock market delivered returns of 7.9%, on average, every year; the bond market rewarded investors with an average annual return of 5%. Over the next 20 years, look for those figures to shrink to as little as 4% to 5% for stocks (if you\u2019re cautious about the economic outlook), and zero to 0.1% for bonds. If you take a more upbeat view of the economy, you can ratchet the figures up to 5.5% to 6.5% for stocks, and 1% to 2% for stocks. Well, that\u2019s OK, isn\u2019t it? You could put all your money in stocks and ignore bonds \u2013 how much difference can a percentage point or two make? You could also put all your eggs in a proverbial basket, and ignore the details. While you\u2019d be right to favor stocks in any asset allocation model (they tend to perform better over the long haul), you also need diversity. As the crisis of 2008 reminded us all, there will be periods when if you don\u2019t have at least part of your portfolio in safer investments, such as bonds, you\u2019ll end up losing capital. A similar look at the long term shows that a single percentage point can make a very, very big difference. Let\u2019s say that you\u2019ve got $100,000 and you\u2019re earning an annual return of 5.5%. At the end of 30 years, assuming you have reinvested all of the money you make, thanks to the magic of compounding, you\u2019ll have about $500,000. But if your returns are only 4.5%, that sum will fall to $375,000. A single percentage point has cost you $125,000 over 30 years. A decline of two percentage points, and you\u2019ve lost nearly half of your total potential returns. McKinsey\u2019s message is that investors need to lower their expectations, work more years and double their savings. While many advisory firms don\u2019t find much to quibble about in McKinsey\u2019s conclusions, some aren\u2019t as willing to tell investors to simply give up. \u201cMcKinsey\u2019s take on lower returns is spot on, in our opinion,\u201d says a memo from New Jersey investment advisor RegentAtlantic. But it also argues there are parts of the market \u2013 such as the emerging markets, and smaller companies in those markets, in particular \u2013 that offer higher returns (and more risk). The report, however, merely articulates handwriting that\u2019s been on the wall for a while. But it does warn that it\u2019s going to be much, much more difficult for any of us to recover from any financial mistakes that we make. The markets aren\u2019t going to give us a helping hand. So when you read lists of financial tips such as starting to contribute to your 401k as soon as you can, don\u2019t see them as suggestions \u2013 they\u2019re commandments. If the market isn\u2019t going to help increase the amount you save, you\u2019ll have to do it, making every dollar you put aside more valuable \u2013 and the dollars you save in your 20s will always be vastly more valuable than those you invest in your 40s or 50s, thanks to compounding. Just do it. Similarly, watch out for some of the worst financial pitfalls you can make: dipping into that 401k, except in the direst of emergencies; racking up credit card debt and making only minimum payments; buying more houses than you can afford. Even paying for private schools from kindergarten through college, or helping to finance your child\u2019s wedding, can be a mistake if you\u2019re doing it at the expense of funding your own retirement needs. Yes, you are investing in your children\u2019s future (or the future health of the florist or wedding photographer\u2019s businesses), but how will they feel when, in 15 to 20 years\u2019 time, they realize that the price for that financial help is ongoing financial support? In a low-return environment, with investment tailwinds transformed into headwinds, those are some of the tough trade-offs that we\u2019ll have to wrestle with. Like it or not, it\u2019s time to prepare for the \u201cnew normal\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s a question that has haunted the minds of high-flying financiers, self-help authors and regular Americans for decades: what\u2019s the best way to make money investing? </p> <p>In the past, the best way, hands down, was to have won the genetic lot: to have been born so that your peak earning and investing years coincided with a bull market. If you came of age in the early 1980s and started investing, you\u2019ve already won the game. Those years saw an extraordinary bull market in the bond market, and the three decades since included what became a golden age for stock market investors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/24/investment-banking-tough-times-nomura-barclays\">Times are hard for bankers \u2013 but they did nearly bankrupt the planet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sure, the stock market\u2019s path was a bumpy one, with downturns, mini-crashes and other more serious bursts, like of the dotcom bubble in 2000. Overall, however, returns greatly exceeded historical averages, and recessions cleared the way for the market to climb to greater heights. Consulting company McKinsey is now warning us that the factors that contributed to those golden age returns don\u2019t exist any more. But the era lasted long enough to make Americans think of it as normal, and to leave us wondering about what feels like an \u201cabnormal\u201d environment of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/15/us-stock-markets-fall-dow-oil-prices-china\">volatile markets and mediocre returns</a>.</p> <p>That, the McKinsey analysts argue in a new report making waves throughout the investment world, is precisely the wrong way to look at the whole matter. It was those abnormally high returns that were unusual, they point out. Now we\u2019re heading into a period of compressed or collapsing investment returns, and we\u2019ll need to adjust all our expectations and behavior accordingly.</p> <p>The McKinsey study attributes the exceptional returns to four unusual factors.</p> <p>A sharp decline in US inflation rates, to well below their historic average, led to a rise in the price that investors were willing to pay for every dollar of corporate earnings, or the much-discussed price/earnings ratio. A steep drop in interest rates boosted returns from bonds and also helped buoy stock prices. While global GDP growth was normal during the golden era, the researchers found that demographics in emerging markets and improving productivity worldwide boosted corporate profits and revenues, and contributed to stock market returns. Then there\u2019s the unprecedented surge in corporate profits in the last three decades: US companies never had it so good.</p> <p>These factors are gone. It\u2019s time to brace for a period in which investment returns could be lower than long-term averages.</p> <p>Between 1985 and 2014, the US stock market delivered returns of 7.9%, on average, every year; the bond market rewarded investors with an average annual return of 5%. Over the next 20 years, look for those figures to shrink to as little as 4% to 5% for stocks (if you\u2019re cautious about the economic outlook), and zero to 0.1% for bonds. If you take a more upbeat view of the economy, you can ratchet the figures up to 5.5% to 6.5% for stocks, and 1% to 2% for stocks.</p> <p>Well, that\u2019s OK, isn\u2019t it?

      "bodyText": "Norm Kelly was quite excited about Drake\u2019s new album. He had that in common with all of Toronto. Views, released on Friday, is an ode to Drake\u2019s hometown: references abound to local streets and landmarks, city transit gets a shout-out, and the album cover, already widely parodied, finds the rapper perched nonchalantly atop the CN Tower. But Kelly\u2019s affection ran deeper than mere civic pride. The 74-year-old city councillor and former de facto mayor greeted the record like a father in a delivery room. His love wasn\u2019t just fervent. It was paternal. Views arrived at midnight and Norm Kelly ushered it in. On Twitter, where he boasts nearly three hundred thousand followers, Kelly was aglow with praise. \u201cThe city is urging those who plan on purchasing #VIEWS to make sure your fire alarm is operational,\u201d he joked in the hours before release. And when it finally dropped, he was succinct about the thrill. He tweeted just two words: \u201cOh boy.\u201d Toronto picked the exclamation up as if he\u2019d just spoken for the whole city. He was retweeted more than five thousand times. Kelly is a social media phenomenon. It\u2019s not often that city councillors are Twitter stars, but Kelly definitely is one. Indeed, among millennials, he\u2019s thought of as part idol and part meme: they\u2019ve christened him \u201c6 Dad\u201d, derived from Drake\u2019s name for Toronto, \u201cthe 6\u201d, which has since become a globally recognized alias for Canada\u2019s largest city. Kelly has been active on Twitter since 2010, but it was only last summer that he attracted so considerable a following. In July, while Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill was engaged in a much-publicized quarrel with Drake, Kelly tweeted a message in supported of the hometown superstar: \u201cYou\u2019re no longer welcome in Toronto, @MeekMill.\u201d It would go on to be retweeted 129,675 times \u2013 and with that, the otherwise inauspicious @norm went viral. Further barbs, nastier (and funnier) still, continued to hit the Twitter stratosphere. So merciless were Kelly\u2019s attacks that Meek Mill was soon compelled to respond: \u201cAye white man @norm what gives you the audacity to tell me I can\u2019t come somewhere over voicing my opinion!\u201d the rapper tweeted. It was highly unusual that a popular rapper should have bothered to retaliate against a politician in his mid-70s. Naturally, Kelly \u2013 and, of course, his new squad of Drake-loving young fans \u2013 took this retort as a compliment. \u201cI innocently strayed on to the rap battlefield,\u201d Kelly said with modesty, seated behind the desk of his City Hall office. \u201cI sent that tweet out there about Meek. That just sparked an enormous amount of interest. With Meek, things turned serious.\u201d Kelly still ribs his rival on occasion, to great effect: a joke he made at the rapper\u2019s expense in January has been retweeted more than 150,000 times. His account generally thrives without confrontation. Interest varies, as you might imagine. A declaration about ginger ale may luck into 6,000 retweets; an advisory about March break activities in Toronto may earn only a few dozen. The breakout successes repeat a familiar theme: rap feuds. In March, Kelly marshalled a Drake reference to trash-talk Donald Trump. Within hours, it had been retweeted 25,000 times. The swagger has proven enormously successful. Kelly is now a full-blown local celebrity: when he goes out, he\u2019s swarmed, cheered, hollered at or excitedly high-fived. Hardly a day passes that an eager Torontonian doesn\u2019t descend upon him, unsheathe an iPhone, and snap a quick selfie. Kelly, the stalwart, septuagenarian politician, has found a new generation of fans, many of whom are too young even to vote. Kelly\u2019s command of contemporary rap vernacular is curiously precise. Impressive too is his fluency in the language of memes: scarcely does he misuse a Gif or hashtag, or deploy a \u201cbae\u201d when he really means \u201cwoes\u201d. Young people, meanwhile, have a low tolerance for imposters and a keen eye for spotting the fakes. They\u2019re quick to call out politicians like Hillary Clinton for trying to sound hip, and lately some have been wondering if Kelly has someone else pulling the levers behind the scenes. Kelly slammed Meek Mill when Mill insisted Drake employed a ghostwriter. Now Kelly is often accused of the same. The chief suspect is Jerry Nasr, a special assistant in Kelly\u2019s office. Toronto media tend to refer to Nasr\u2019s presence in the office in a somewhat accusatory way: there are often \u201crumors\u201d of his involvement with the Twitter account, or suggestions that his purview extends beyond what he claims. \u201cWith pictures and stuff,\u201d he told me vaguely, when I asked outright in what way he helped. Kelly elaborated: \u201cOne of the things I learned, early on, was that a tweet that uses a visual gets more viewers than just text. I asked Jerry if he could do the time-consuming search for photographs to illustrate what I\u2019m looking for. If he finds something that really intrigues him, he brings it to my attention.\u201d Nasr, too, keeps Kelly \u201cup to date with what\u2019s trending\u201d, but the content, he insists, \u201cis all Norm\u201d. For Kelly, the practice is an expression of his sensibility. \u201cI grew up on Laurel and Hardy, Groucho Marx, Monty Python. To have an outlet for the comic sense I\u2019ve developed over the years really strikes me as something fun.\u201d The strategy has clearly been successful: people adore Norm. But his popularity among millennials is not without complications. Kelly\u2019s high profile has made him the target of a number of vitriolic local editorials \u2013 most of which insinuate that time in the spotlight is time he could be doing the mundane work of politics, echoing the problems pundits in the country have had with Justin Trudeau\u2019s winning charm \u2013and has trained on him a high degree of scrutiny. Whatever drawbacks stardom brings, Kelly can be assured of one ally: Drake, the 6 God himself. Not long after his skirmish with Meek Mill, Kelly received word of a social invitation: Drake wanted him to be his guest at OVO Fest, the annual concert he hosts in Toronto. But Kelly couldn\u2019t make it. They were fated to meet again. Last autumn, Kelly was invited by a local university\u2019s student union to attend a free outdoor concert \u2013 an invitation extended with ulterior motives. \u201cThey told me they had invited Drake,\u201d Kelly remembers. \u201cSigns, as they read them, indicated there was a pretty good chance Drake would be there. They said if I could come and meet him, that would be the cherry on top.\u201d Drake did indeed turn up, and he welcomed Kelly warmly. \u201cWe chatted very comfortably,\u201d Kelly says, understandably pleased. (Kelly, of course, had company: \u201cJerry came and brought his girlfriend.\u201d) Since then, the pair have been friendly. \u201cI saw Drake at a Toronto Raptors game recently,\u201d Kelly tells me. \u201cI approached him to say hello. He sensed me coming. He turned to look at me, and his first words were, \u20186 Dad!\u2019\u201d",

With Meek, things turned serious.\u201d Kelly still ribs his rival on occasion, to great effect:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/norm/status/688886736991170561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"> a joke he made at the rapper\u2019s expense in January</a> has been retweeted more than 150,000 times.</p> <p>His account generally thrives without confrontation. Interest varies, as you might imagine. A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/norm/status/709932390366453760\"> declaration</a> about ginger ale may luck into 6,000 retweets; an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/norm/status/709390927756988416\">advisory</a> about March break activities in Toronto may earn only a few dozen. The breakout successes repeat a familiar theme: rap feuds. In March, Kelly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/norm/status/709545848032497665\">marshalled </a>a Drake reference to trash-talk Donald Trump. Within hours, it had been retweeted 25,000 times.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/norm/status/688886736991170561\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When your girl lets you take pics with her money. <a href=\"https://t.co/I0NNUAMg0l\">pic.twitter.com/I0NNUAMg0l</a></p>&mdash; Norm Kelly (@norm) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/norm/status/688886736991170561\">January 18, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/29/views-drake-new-album-talking-points\">Views on Views: the talking points from Drake\u2019s new album</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The swagger has proven enormously successful. Kelly is now a full-blown local celebrity: when he goes out, he\u2019s swarmed, cheered, hollered at or excitedly high-fived. Hardly a day passes that an eager Torontonian doesn\u2019t descend upon him, unsheathe an iPhone, and snap a quick selfie. Kelly, the stalwart, septuagenarian politician, has found a new generation of fans, many of whom are too young even to vote.</p> <p>Kelly\u2019s command of contemporary rap vernacular is curiously precise. Impressive too is his fluency in the language of memes: scarcely does he misuse a Gif or hashtag, or deploy a \u201cbae\u201d when he really means \u201cwoes\u201d. Young people, meanwhile, have a low tolerance for imposters and a keen eye for spotting the fakes. They\u2019re quick to call out politicians <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2015/12/hillary_clinton_speaks_like_a_millennial_on_social_media.html\">like Hillary Clinton</a> for trying to sound hip, and lately some have been wondering if Kelly has someone else <a href=\"http://torontoist.com/2016/01/2015-villain-norm/\">pulling the levers</a> behind the scenes. Kelly slammed Meek Mill when Mill insisted Drake employed a ghostwriter. Now Kelly is often <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samomaryleona/status/692117967551762432\">accused</a> of the same. </p> <p>The chief suspect is Jerry Nasr, a special assistant in Kelly\u2019s office. Toronto media tend to refer to Nasr\u2019s presence in the office in a somewhat accusatory way: there are often \u201crumors\u201d of his involvement with the Twitter account, or suggestions that his purview extends beyond what he claims. \u201cWith pictures and stuff,\u201d he told me vaguely, when I asked outright in what way he helped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77cc33096b882708a20d7440f54b2d26412a708c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77cc33096b882708a20d7440f54b2d26412a708c/0_58_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Norm Kelly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norm Kelly: \u2018I innocently strayed on to the rap battlefield.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Irvine James</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kelly elaborated: \u201cOne of the things I learned, early on, was that a tweet that uses a visual gets more viewers than just text. I asked Jerry if he could do the time-consuming search for photographs to illustrate what I\u2019m looking for. If he finds something that really intrigues him, he brings it to my attention.\u201d Nasr, too, keeps Kelly \u201cup to date with what\u2019s trending\u201d, but the content, he insists, \u201cis all Norm\u201d. </p> <p>For Kelly, the practice is an expression of his sensibility. \u201cI grew up on Laurel and Hardy, Groucho Marx, Monty Python. To have an outlet for the comic sense I\u2019ve developed over the years really strikes me as something fun.\u201d</p> <p>The strategy has clearly been successful: people adore Norm. But his popularity among millennials is not without complications. Kelly\u2019s high profile has made him the target of a number of vitriolic local editorials \u2013 most of which insinuate that time in the spotlight is time he could be doing the mundane work of politics, echoing the problems pundits in the country <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/18/justin-trudeau-canada-prime-minister-politics-appearence\">have had with Justin Trudeau\u2019s winning charm</a> \u2013and has trained on him a high degree of scrutiny.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I grew up on Laurel and Hardy, Groucho Marx, Monty Python.

Not long after his skirmish with Meek Mill, Kelly received word of a social invitation: Drake wanted him to be his guest at OVO Fest, the annual concert he hosts in Toronto. But Kelly couldn\u2019t make it. </p> <p>They were fated to meet again. Last autumn, Kelly was invited by a local university\u2019s student union to attend a free outdoor concert \u2013 an invitation extended with ulterior motives. \u201cThey told me they had invited Drake,\u201d Kelly remembers. \u201cSigns, as they read them, indicated there was a pretty good chance Drake would be there. They said if I could come and meet him, that would be the cherry on top.\u201d Drake did indeed turn up, and he welcomed Kelly warmly. \u201cWe chatted very comfortably,\u201d Kelly says, understandably pleased. (Kelly, of course, had company: \u201cJerry came and brought his girlfriend.\u201d)</p> <p>Since then, the pair have been friendly. \u201cI saw Drake at a Toronto Raptors game recently,\u201d Kelly tells me. \u201cI approached him to say hello. He sensed me coming. He turned to look at me, and his first words were, \u20186 Dad!\u2019\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As Stig Abell settled into the editor\u2019s chair at the Times Literary Supplement last Wednesday he may have been relieved that his days as managing editor of the Sun were over. It was the day his former paper faced a barrage of protest for failing to cover the inquest verdict of the 1989 Hillsborough football tragedy on its front page. When asked Abell wouldn\u2019t say what he would have done if still at the Sun, but it seems unlikely the sensitive man colleagues describe would have agreed with the story\u2019s treatment. Nevertheless there is an incongruity to his change of jobs. He agrees that, after spending the best part of three years at the populist red-top, his move to a highbrow literary weekly review is remarkable. \u201cIt\u2019s a very strange old thing, isn\u2019t it,\u201d he says. Anyone studying his CV would concur and might also believe he has enjoyed something of a gilded life. He has built a successful media career as a newspaper executive, radio broadcaster and TV performer some 15 years after graduating from Cambridge with a double first but without any firm plans. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a clue what I wanted to do,\u201d he says. \u201cI saw a Guardian advert offering a starter job for a graduate with the Press Complaints Commission, so I applied.\u201d He also emailed the TLS\u2019s then fiction editor, Lindsay Duguid, and said he would like to review books. \u201cShe had a wonderful policy of trying people out and sent me a novel by the American author, Ethan Canin, asking for 600 words please. And that was it. I started writing for the TLS every month.\u201d That led to him also reviewing for the Daily Telegraph and the Spectator. \u201cI had this little cottage industry of book reviewing while at the PCC.\u201d His rise at the now defunct PCC saw him promoted rapidly to assistant director, then deputy director and, in 2009, to the key role of director. He had already formed a good working relationship with a chairman he admired, Christopher Meyer, but they soon found themselves plunged into the phone-hacking controversy. Abell says: \u201cWe were a small group trying to help members of the public while upholding the principle of freedom of expression. But the PCC\u2019s phone-hacking report was wrong. And we were widely criticised for being insufficiently interested in hacking, which has a certain amount of truth to it. We were overwhelmed, and I spent two years trying to keep the PCC relevant as the scandal grew worse. Let\u2019s be honest: it was an issue that bamboozled institutions a lot more powerful than the PCC.\u201d He stresses that the regulator was being sensibly reformed until \u201cthe edifice came down\u201d with the Guardian\u2019s revelation in July 2011 about the interceptions of Milly Dowler\u2019s voicemail messages. Then came the Leveson inquiry and Abell wrote the longest submission by any organisation, 140,000 words. \u201cIt was just me in a room with our lawyer,\u201d he recalls with some pride. He left soon afterwards. \u201cI had to think of my mental health, my family life. It was a very stressful job running the PCC.\u201d He took a salary cut to work for Pagefield, an agency specialising in corporate reputation management. \u201cIt was fascinating,\u201d he says. \u201cI was able to draw on my experience in handling PCC media storms. I did crisis communications for two years and enjoyed it.\u201d But he hankered for a return to the newspaper industry and was offered managing editorships at two titles. He chose to answer the call from the Sun\u2019s editor, David Dinsmore. With his PCC background, was he not viewed as the gatekeeper becoming a poacher? He agrees: \u201cPeople could have been sniffy, but they were welcoming because they could see I was just trying to help them do their jobs. \u201cI realised the need to restore confidence among staff who\u2019d had the stuffing knocked out of them because so many had been arrested for paying public officials. I feel very protective of the Sun and the staff. There are so many nice, decent people who don\u2019t get the credit they deserve.\u201d He also exhibits some of the paper\u2019s chippiness about what its staff regard as establishment bias against the Sun. As an example, he points to the failure to win the scoop of the year award for its July 2015 story, \u201cTheir royal heilnesses\u201d, the revelation of a 1933 film clip of the future Edward VIII teaching the princesses how to make a Nazi salute. \u201cI remember walking with David to Buckingham Palace to show them the video two days before publication. Then we published it across eight pages, did it beautifully, proper popular history and popular tabloid journalism. We were so proud of it and got nothing for it.\u201d Despite his lack of a journalistic background, Abell regularly edited Monday issues of the Sun. \u201cI got great satisfaction from it,\u201d he says. But the severing of his partnership with Dinsmore is thought to have played a part in his decision to leave the paper. Once Tony Gallagher became editor, Abell had less of an influence in the newsroom. But by that time, he had expanded his media profile, having become a radio presenter on LBC and a newspaper reviewer on Sky News. Is he not in danger of doing too much? \u201cYes, but it\u2019s a precarious existence in the media. I\u2019ve agreed with my wonderful understanding wife that I\u2019ll work hard for 10 to 15 years and take it while I can get it, provided that the life doesn\u2019t destroy home life.\u201d And now for the TLS: how did he land that job? With the planned retirement after 14 years of its editor, Peter Stothard, there were vague plans to approach a high-profile figure, such as Martin Amis. But they were abandoned when Abell sent a two-page document with ideas for revitalising the weekly to News UK chief executive, Rebekah Brooks. She showed it to News Corp\u2019s chief executive, Robert Thomson, who said: \u201cGo for it.\u201d Abell scoffs at any suggestion of dumbing down. \u201cI love the paper but I think there\u2019s more to be done with it. I\u2019ve sat down with virtually every member of staff. They have ideas too. They\u2019re interested, enthusiastic and passionate, so I\u2019m looking forward to working with them. I\u2019m also respectful of the readers who currently subscribe. They are loyal, have certain expectations, so the changes that may come are additional, not substitutions.\u201d And what might they be? He talks of \u201cmore cultural content, more film reviews, essays, works-in-progress by writers\u201d. Abell recognises the TLS, which lays claim to 30,000 subscribers for its print and digital versions, is a niche publication. Its elite readers are arguably less likely to drift away than those deserting daily newsprint titles. \u201cIt provides intelligent journalism and that\u2019s a growth area,\u201d he says. He believes the audience straddles two groups \u2013 an academic readership that \u201cregards the TLS as an authority [because it] reviews big, serious books properly\u201d and university-educated professional people \u2013 lawyers, say, or doctors and accountants \u2013 \u201cwho are interested in being challenged, big ideas\u201d. He believes the TLS enjoys \u201ca great reputation in America because it epitomises the best of British scholarship, and the best of British journalism.\u201d Abell thinks that the gradual reduction of their arts coverage by several national papers in the UK offers the TLS an opportunity to pick up new readers \u201ceager to engage with important cultural ideas\u201d. He also reveals that the TLS is to become part of the Times\u2019s overall subscription offering and that \u201cpodcasts are coming\u201d. Abell, known for having spent his commuting hours in 2013 reading the complete plays of Shakespeare, bubbles with as much enthusiasm for his new venture as he did for his Sun front pages.

      "bodyText": "It took a little more than 12 hours for Will Ferrell to drop out of a starring role in a satirical film about Ronald Reagan\u2019s struggles with Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 just long enough for conservatives to muster up a bit of outrage with which to knock the comedian into submission, and to raise questions about whether the free speech brigade has become PC. Hadn\u2019t they said self-censorship and worrying about offending people are signs of the apocalypse? Aren\u2019t I a bleeding heart liberal who needs to lighten up? Partisan gaming aside, how far can satire go \u2013 is there a line? I\u2019d argue yes, even when it comes to leaders round the world. It\u2019s easy to make fun of politicians, especially presidents. Most have big, honking targets on their backs, or, in the case of Bill Clinton, a massive nose on his face \u2013 ready material for cartoonists, journalists and comedy writers. It\u2019s also cathartic for the public to needle our fellow citizens who wield the bloody cudgel of authority. We see our leaders every day, on television, the internet, or the front page of a tabloid \u2013 the ubiquity of heads of state is rivaled only by Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter, who seems to hold more sway over the average human life than the president of Brazil, impeached or unimpeached. I could probably draw Barack Obama\u2019s face from memory faster than I could my own face (to be fair, I mostly know my face from absolute necessity \u2013 it\u2019s unavoidable when I have to take on a pimple or measure the width of my bald spot). Politicians are especially inviting for mockery when you realize that they control our lives and may or may not be unrepentantly corrupt. The image of David Cameron, the British prime minister, defiling a pig knocks him down to our level, or slightly below us \u2013 I don\u2019t know many pig defilers at this stage. The moralistic ones are even more tempting. The \u201cTed Cruz is the Zodiac Killer\u201d meme is funny only because the man persists in telling everyone else on the planet how to behave, like some kind of beady-eyed Miss Manners. I hate to explain how comedy works, but if he actually murdered anyone, we probably wouldn\u2019t laugh quite as much. Ronald Reagan \u2013 actor, governor, president, tearer-downer of walls, breaker of chains, and mother of dragons \u2013 certainly opened himself up for mockery during his time in office. The pithy one-liners, the cowboy hats, and the homespun wisdom made him seem less like a human being and more like the generic president from a B-grade disaster movie. It\u2019s as though America elected William Devane or Robert Vaughn to run the country. Why not laugh at a guy like that? But the least funny thing about Reagan was that he had Alzheimer\u2019s. I\u2019m grateful that I\u2019ve never had to watch the disease take hold in a loved one, but few fates sound more terrifying than someone you care about forgetting who you are. Dementia does not strike me as unmined territory of comedy. That said, I think plenty of people on the left want to laugh at Reagan for the same reason conservatives love to verbally abuse Obama: the adoration the other side showers on him can verge on the obnoxious. But liberals are also told, routinely, that Reagan\u2019s resume was unimpeachable. They\u2019re bombarded with talking points from modern politicians, who are desperate to detail the belief system of St Ronnie. Cruz mentions Reagan in his stump speeches so often that you\u2019d think he keeps around a cardboard cutout of the man everywhere he goes, to lay offerings at its feet and fake photos with other believers. I\u2019d be happy to never hear the name Ronald Reagan again outside of a rousing game of Trivial Pursuit: Film Edition. But mocking his disease is akin to trying to make light of Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s polio. He had no control over it, and it devastated those around him. It\u2019s the very definition of punching down, and because I am not an unfeeling monster, I can\u2019t help but sympathize with Reagan\u2019s children, who will never be able to laugh at their father\u2019s condition. Before we knew Reagan had Alzheimer\u2019s, reports of his issues with lucidity were treated as fair game by comedy writers. On Saturday Night Live, Phil Hartman portrayed the 40th US president as a doddering geriatric, prone to falling asleep during briefings, an impression based on the political chatter of the day. His wife, Nancy, had an astrologer offer advice during her time in the White House, which still sounds insane, even during a year when the presumptive Republican nominee for president has appeared at WrestleMania and been on the receiving end of a Stone Cold Stunner. At the time, it probably felt like a relief to to caricature Reagan as a crazy old fool, a man who loved naps more than running a country, who turned a blind eye toward the Aids epidemic, shut down mental hospitals, destroyed trade unions, and generally cratered our economy so badly with supply-side theories that, by the time he left office, the nation was trapped in a crippling recession. His successor took the blame. Those horrible policy decisions are what make Reagan an object for ridicule. As is often the case, the people across from him on the ideological divide feel they can reclaim their dignity through a well-executed joke. It\u2019s why Republicans relish any chance to paint Obama as a pretentious communist from Kenya, and why Democrats never tire of portraying George W Bush as a yokel. Satire is the great equalizer, the last tool available to the helpless masses. Armed rebellions haven\u2019t been popular in this country for a couple of centuries, so a sharp witticism is the next best thing. There\u2019s a reason Donald Trump spent so much time attempting to thwart the efforts of Graydon Carter\u2019s 90s satire magazine, Spy. Two decades later, he\u2019s still saying his hands are normal, beautiful, completely fine. If satire is a valuable tool for the proletariat, then why have limits? Why not attack Reagan? His missteps still haunt the nation, so shouldn\u2019t he have to answer for them? Or should we hold tight to the modicum of decency in all of us? The former president isn\u2019t around to field the criticisms of a movie or an op-ed, but his family is still here to relive whatever agony his deterioration and death brought. The joke is not on Reagan for being sick, or on his children. It\u2019s on us for rubber-stamping his policies, and then elevating him to the level of a deity after he died. Instead of seriously dealing with his legacy, people name airports after him and use him to score political points. No movie is going to change what we\u2019ve done.",

    "webTitle": "TV networks battle new media threat as Facebook looms over ad war", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Television executives have cause to be scared: though they\u2019ve survived at least eight years of predicted doom, billions in ad money has disappeared, ratings have dwindled and new power players have emerged from unexpected corners. While the old guard has struggled on, Facebook and Google have risen. As they have since 2008, a horde of aspiring power players will converge on New York City for the annual marathon of internet company presentations, the Digital Content NewFronts: YouTube, Vice, Hulu, Activision Blizzard, and old-media stalwarts like Playboy and the Economist trying to get in on the action. The pitch is usually simple: we are the new guard, despite our advancing age \u2013 television is old hat. The event is timed to come before the TV giants have a chance to make their own pitches in the middle of May, and each company will make its own claim to be the best alternative to stodgy old channel-surfing. But one company, the behemoth sucking cash out of ad budgets in multiple industries, won\u2019t be in attendance. \u201cFacebook added nearly two Viacoms of ad revenue last quarter,\u201d tweeted Rich Greenfield, an analyst with the financial firm BTIG, with a chart to compare the fortunes of the social media giant and the troubled cable conglomerate. Viacom still owns quite a bit of \u201cmind share\u201d, as business-school types call the section of our brains colonized by marketers, such as Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures, among others. But this quarter, the company had to admit that it faces declines not just in ad revenue but in fees paid by cable companies for Viacom programming. In April, the federal government announced steps to further loosen cable companies\u2019 grip on the market. Viacom\u2019s declines \u2013 mirrored by those of its rivals \u2013 are widely considered to be part of a domino effect amid the rise of Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime and other streaming services, many of which will present at next week\u2019s NewFronts. Cable companies that long enjoyed captive audiences are now stuck watching their viewers flee for cheaper venues. Those companies are adjusting \u2013 many are simply ratcheting up the price of internet subscriptions to homes that abandon TV, or introducing artificial \u201cdata caps\u201d on those same services, a move that mostly affects streaming video. Some have tried to meet their viewers halfway \u2013 Comcast\u2019s consumer interface now includes a Netflix-like library, for instance \u2013 but others are mired in bureaucracy. And TV ratings show that people aren\u2019t waiting around for companies to make things easier, Greenfield wrote last week, after research on corporate earnings. He said subscribers were finally leaving cable subscriptions for good. \u201cWe believe if the video subscriber trends of the past six months continue throughout 2016, video subscribers could fall by over 600,000,\u201d he said. The previous year, the top seven cable companies lost only 48,000 customers. But the battle for dollars is not simply between streaming sites and old-fashioned TV \u2013 it\u2019s between video and everything else, especially Google and Facebook, the two companies that are winning the war. One factor in Facebook\u2019s growth, obscured by the philanthropic activities of its founder, is that as a business it is an advertising platform first, foremost and almost exclusively. Google will be in attendance next week; YouTube, owned by the digital media giant, reliably holds the best-attended presentation of the week. Facebook, in particular, has been very successful in its bid to move huge swaths of mobile activity, much of it ad-friendly, to its flagship app. Last week it reported $5.2bn of about $5.4bn in total revenue in the previous three months. Google, which doesn\u2019t break out revenues from YouTube, put its own revenues from advertising across all its platforms at $18bn. There are other apps, such as WhatsApp, where it has not yet even \u201cturned on\u201d advertising, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg put it on last week\u2019s earnings call. Disney, during the three months ending 2 January, earned $6.3bn from all of its television businesses \u2013 from both ads and cable subscriptions. This is still an increase, but an increase, the company admits, \u201cpartially offset by lower ratings\u201d. Disney\u2019s share of the TV market is huge, but it competes with several gigantic players: Viacom, Fox, Comcast, Warner Bros and others. No one in the digital world can hold a candle to Google or Facebook. In a conference call last week, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, responded diplomatically to a question about ad budgets leaving the TV sector, saying: \u201cDollars are shifting from all types of media formats to where consumers are spending their time\u201d. That shift, at the moment, is undramatic: ad spend on TV was down in 2015, but it was only down to $80.4bn from a little over $82bn the year before, according to Nielsen. Facebook\u2019s ad revenue for 2015 was $17.1bn. More, if you forgive some losses on currency exchange. Google\u2019s ad revenue for the same period was $67.4bn. Neither company breaks out its video ad units, but together, with $84.5bn, they exceed the entire US TV advertising economy, and are essentially the only games in town. At this point every year, ad buyers tend to remind TV networks that budgets are fungible, and not just from one kind of video to another, but across types of media \u2013 away from print, for example. Google and Facebook control as many types of media as they possibly can. The tech giants \u201care capturing the vast majority of the industry\u2019s growth\u201d. said Brian Wieser, senior analyst for Pivotal Research and formerly a forecaster at the major ad agency Magna Global. In this new role, Facebook and Google act like advertising agencies: they have huge, international operations, with scattered units that can shift to nestle comfortably into a given user\u2019s life. Media companies are diversified across various kinds of revenue, including movie ticket sales, theme parks, affiliate fees and advertising. Facebook and Google are diversified across various kinds of advertising. So as the ad world lines up to see new products over the next two weeks, and then does the same for the major TV companies, buyers may long for the times when networks and the cable companies set the schedule. \u201cContent is king\u201d, the mantra at every presentation, has been cast into doubt by the influence of digital platforms. As any process server knows, it isn\u2019t the letter in the envelope that matters most \u2013 it\u2019s who delivers it, and how.",

But one company, the behemoth sucking cash out of ad budgets in multiple industries, won\u2019t be in attendance.</p> <p>\u201cFacebook added nearly two Viacoms of ad revenue last quarter,\u201d tweeted Rich Greenfield, an analyst with the financial firm BTIG, with a chart to compare the fortunes of the social media giant and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/18/sumner-redstone-health-viacom-cbs-lawsuit\">the troubled cable conglomerate</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RichBTIG/status/725800486767607809\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Internet vs TV<br><br>Facebook added nearly two Viacoms of ad revenue last quarter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/goodlucktv?src=hash\">#goodlucktv</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/vA98xqoZkx\">pic.twitter.com/vA98xqoZkx</a></p>&mdash; Rich Greenfield (@RichBTIG) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RichBTIG/status/725800486767607809\">April 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Viacom still owns quite a bit of \u201cmind share\u201d, as business-school types call the section of our brains colonized by marketers, such as Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures, among others. But this quarter, the company had to admit that it faces declines not just in ad revenue but in fees paid by cable companies for Viacom programming. In April, the federal government announced steps to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/15/obama-fcc-support-cable-box-options-broadband\">further loosen cable companies\u2019 grip </a>on the market. </p> <p>Viacom\u2019s declines \u2013 mirrored by those of its rivals \u2013 are widely considered to be part of a domino effect amid the rise of Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime and other streaming services, many of which will present at next week\u2019s NewFronts. </p> <p>Cable companies that long enjoyed captive audiences are now stuck watching their viewers flee for cheaper venues. Those companies are adjusting \u2013 many are simply ratcheting up the price of internet subscriptions to homes that abandon TV, or introducing artificial \u201cdata caps\u201d on those same services, a move that mostly affects streaming video. Some have tried to meet their viewers halfway \u2013 Comcast\u2019s consumer interface now includes a Netflix-like library, for instance \u2013 but others are mired in bureaucracy.</p> <p>And TV ratings show that people aren\u2019t waiting around for companies to make things easier, Greenfield wrote last week, after research on corporate earnings. He said subscribers were finally leaving cable subscriptions for good. \u201cWe believe if the video subscriber trends of the past six months continue throughout 2016, video subscribers could fall by over 600,000,\u201d he said. The previous year, the top seven cable companies lost only 48,000 customers. </p> <p>But the battle for dollars is not simply between streaming sites and old-fashioned TV \u2013 it\u2019s between video and everything else, especially Google and Facebook, the two companies that are winning the war. One factor in Facebook\u2019s growth, obscured by the philanthropic activities of its founder, is that as a business it is an advertising platform first, foremost and almost exclusively. Google will be in attendance next week; YouTube, owned by the digital media giant, reliably holds the best-attended presentation of the week.</p> <p>Facebook, in particular, has been very successful in its bid to move huge swaths of mobile activity, much of it ad-friendly, to its flagship app. Last week it reported $5.2bn of about $5.4bn in total revenue in the previous three months. Google, which doesn\u2019t break out revenues from YouTube, put its own revenues from advertising across all its platforms at $18bn. There are other apps, such as WhatsApp, where it has not yet even \u201cturned on\u201d advertising, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg put it on last week\u2019s earnings call.</p> <p>Disney, during the three months ending 2 January, earned $6.3bn from all of its television businesses \u2013 from both ads and cable subscriptions. This is still an increase, but an increase, the company admits, \u201cpartially offset by lower ratings\u201d. Disney\u2019s share of the TV market is huge, but it competes with several gigantic players: Viacom, Fox, Comcast, Warner Bros and others. No one in the digital world can hold a candle to Google or Facebook.</p> <p>In a conference call last week, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, responded diplomatically to a question about ad budgets leaving the TV sector, saying: \u201cDollars are shifting from all types of media formats to where consumers are spending their time\u201d. </p> <p>That shift, at the moment, is undramatic: ad spend on TV was down in 2015, but it was only down to $80.4bn from a little over $82bn the year before, according to Nielsen.</p> <p>Facebook\u2019s ad revenue for 2015 was $17.1bn. More, if you forgive some losses on currency exchange. Google\u2019s ad revenue for the same period was $67.4bn. Neither company breaks out its video ad units, but together, with $84.5bn, they exceed the entire US TV advertising economy, and are essentially the only games in town. At this point every year, ad buyers tend to remind TV networks that budgets are fungible, and not just from one kind of video to another, but across types of media \u2013 away from print, for example. Google and Facebook control as many types of media as they possibly can. The tech giants \u201care capturing the vast majority of the industry\u2019s growth\u201d. said Brian Wieser, senior analyst for Pivotal Research and formerly a forecaster at the major ad agency Magna Global. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/30/the-handmaids-tale-hulu-tv-series-margaret-atwood-women\">The Handmaid's Tale is coming to Hulu \u2013 with a white man at the helm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In this new role, Facebook and Google act like advertising agencies: they have huge, international operations, with scattered units that can shift to nestle comfortably into a given user\u2019s life. Media companies are diversified across various kinds of revenue, including movie ticket sales, theme parks, affiliate fees and advertising. Facebook and Google are diversified across various kinds of advertising.</p> <p>So as the ad world lines up to see new products over the next two weeks, and then does the same for the major TV companies, buyers may long for the times when networks and the cable companies set the schedule. \u201cContent is king\u201d, the mantra at every presentation, has been cast into doubt by the influence of digital platforms. As any process server knows, it isn\u2019t the letter in the envelope that matters most \u2013 it\u2019s who delivers it, and how.</p>",

      "bodyText": "7 May 2011 The mood is mixed. Leicester finish 10th in the Championship with a chaotic but upbeat 4-2 home win over Ipswich. Sven-Goran Eriksson \u2013 hired expensively in October by the club\u2019s Thai-based 80% owners to clean up after Paulo Sousa\u2019s nine-game reign \u2013 reflects on his lot. \u201cAt one stage this season I could have bet we would finish in the play-offs. But we conceded too many goals all season, and today was typical. We must alter our approach.\u201d 18 May 2011 Thai owners Vichai and Aiyawatt Raksriaksorn buy the other 20%, and promise Eriksson a hefty budget. 27 June 2011 He rises to the challenge \u2013 spending \u00a315m on 13 players, including Leeds keeper Kasper Schmeichel. He later reveals he also fancies LA Galaxy\u2019s David Beckham (\u201che would be welcome\u201d), and shares the big vision: \u201cThe target is not only to reach the Premier League but to stay in it. And to reach Europe too.\u201d 24 October 2011 13 games later Eriksson is sacked \u2013 signing off after a 3-0 home defeat by Millwall. The owners change course and opt for a familiar face instead: Nigel Pearson rehired 17 months after he left for Hull. \u201cI am prepared to put myself into what is a pressure situation,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t mind that positive pressure. Expectations are high, but that doesn\u2019t faze me.\u201d 30 January 2012 Pearson adds to Eriksson\u2019s spending, signing Ben Marshall from Stoke, and two others who will have a bigger impact: \u00a31m Danny Drinkwater from Manchester United, and \u00a31m Wes Morgan from Forest. 17 May 2012 Pearson leads his side to an untidy ninth-place finish, with just one win in the final four. The owners sanction another overhaul \u2013 with the most eye-catching move of the summer a \u00a31m deal for prolific 25-year-old Fleetwood striker Jamie Vardy, a record fee for a non-league player. Vardy says he hopes he can make the step up. \u201cI know the standard of the players is going to be a lot better. But I\u2019ve played in the FA Cup a few times this year and managed to do well against the league clubs. Hopefully I can carry that on.\u201d 5 October 2012 After another mixed start, the owners deny reports that they plan to sack Pearson and hire Harry Redknapp instead. \u201cNigel has and continues to retain our total support, and remains absolutely key to what we are trying to achieve. Our appetite and desire for success with Nigel as manager remains undiminished.\u201d Pearson shrugs it off. \u201cI don\u2019t know who is being mischievous in terms of these stories. It\u2019s a bit of an irritant but it\u2019s not going to alter how I work.\u201d Results stay inconsistent, but they reach Boxing Day in fifth. 21 February 2013 After a fine run of form lifts them to second, a sudden downturn prompts a loan deal: 19-year-old Harry Kane arriving from Spurs. \u201cHe\u2019s a player we know a lot about,\u201d says Pearson. \u201cHe will bring goals and a fresh impetus. It keeps the competition keen.\u201d Kane scores on his debut against Blackburn but his presence fails to stop the slide. City approach the final day having dropped outside the play-offs, needing a win away at Forest. But against the odds they do it \u2013 3-2, via a late winner from Anthony Knockaert. It secures sixth place. 12 May 2013 After winning their play-off semi-final first leg 1-0, Leicester travel to Watford, one game from Wembley. It\u2019s a day few will forget. 2-1 down in the 95th-minute, Pearson\u2019s side are given a penalty. Anthony Knockaert steps up \u2013 but Manuel Almunia saves both his shot and his follow-up. Then it gets worse. Watford launch a counterattack, and 20 seconds later it\u2019s 3-1 to the home side. Reporter Johnny Phillips, trying to describe it all in real-time for Sky, goes viral. Pearson says: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a worse way to lose.\u201d 11 January 2014 After regrouping over the summer, City fly through the first few months and are top by the turn of the year. Looking to cement the run, the owners sanction another deal: Pearson landing \u00a3350,000 Le Havre winger Riyad Mahrez. \u201cRiyad is a pleasing addition,\u201d says Pearson. \u201cWhenever we look to add to our squad, it has to be a player that will improve us while complementing what we already have. Riyad fits that description.\u201d 6 April 2014 With promotion secured and six games still to play, Pearson reveals how he did it \u2013 explaining he had to clear Sven-Goran Eriksson\u2019s costly \u201crubbish\u201d out of the squad to produce a winning formula. \u201cPeople want to talk about this season in isolation, but I keep telling them it\u2019s actually about what has been done over the last two-and-a-half years. One of the biggest jobs was to get rid of the rubbish \u2013 the players who don\u2019t have any value. We now have lots who can make this step up. I intend to keep them together.\u201d 22 April 2014 A 1-0 win at Bolton secures the title with two games to spare. They end the season having broken a string of club records, including a brilliant run of nine consecutive league wins. Pearson is named Championship manager of the year, while Schmeichel, Morgan and Drinkwater all make it into the PFA team. The owners, meanwhile, insist they can still comply with Financial Fair Play rules, despite announcing a \u00a334m loss for 2012-13. \u201cWe are highly confident of complying with league regulations.\u201d 25 June 2014 Pearson agrees a three-year contract extension, Vardy signs a four-year deal and summer signings include Villa\u2019s Marc Albrighton, Brighton\u2019s Leonardo Ulloa, former Inter star Esteban Cambiasso and QPR\u2019s Danny Simpson. Pearson sets out his vision for City\u2019s first season back in the top flight after a 10-year absence and rejects any talk that he might have to drop his low-profile, sitting-in-the-stands approach in favour of a more centre-stage, headline-making role. I do think there is a lot of pressure on managers to behave in a certain way \u2013 this talk of \u2018passion\u2019 \u2013 which I don\u2019t always think is beneficial. I look at managers and think \u2018Are you acting? Are you playing the role that people want you to play?\u2019 For English managers it is almost as if you have got to act in that \u2018passionate\u2019 way \u2013 there\u2019s more slack cut for foreign coaches because they seem able to look \u2018thoughtful\u2019 \u2026 and then there\u2019s this talk about whether you wear a suit or a tracksuit. I don\u2019t intend changing how I look just because I\u2019m in the Premier League. I will wear a tracksuit.\u201d 21 September 2014 The promised tidy, low-key start to the season explodes into life with one of the top flight\u2019s great comebacks: Leicester, 3-1 down, beating Manchester United 5\u20133. It\u2019s the first time in 853 Premier League matches that United have surrendered a two-goal lead and lost. Vardy sets up his side\u2019s first, wins two penalties and scores the fourth. \u201cWhen you\u2019re 3-1 down against United, to win the game, I think it\u2019s a decent result,\u201d Pearson says. \u201cIt says a lot about the character. We\u2019ve got a bit more quality than people maybe think.\u201d 7 February 2015 But the feelgood factor fades fast. Two months after being fined for verbally abusing a Leicester fan during a defeat to Liverpool, the pressure on Pearson appears to tell again. In a bizarre moment, he holds down and mock-strangles Palace\u2019s James McArthur during a 1-0 loss. Asked why he refused to let go, he tells the press: \u201cBecause he said something to me. I\u2019m more than capable of looking after myself.\u201d Pearson is sacked \u2013 only to be reinstated hours later when the owners have a change of heart. 14 March 2015 After a 0-0 draw with Hull \u2013 towards the end of an eight-game winless run \u2013 Pearson is asked by a reporter whether his bottom-placed side are \u201cwaxing or waning\u201d in the relegation run-in. \u201cI don\u2019t have to use that sort of analogy,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are in the same position. We\u2019ve got 10 games left, six games at home, and our home form has to be drastically improved to give us the best chance [of staying up]. That\u2019s it. You got any more questions you want to ask? Obviously not. Waxing or waning? Fucking hell. My arse.\u201d 29 April 2015 A 3-1 home defeat to Chelsea stalls what looks like a dramatic late revival, ending a run of four straight wins which had lifted them to 17th. After the game Pearson says his players have been unfairly criticised by the press, then becomes involved in a row with a reporter who asks for clarification. \u201cI think you are an ostrich. Your head must be in the sand. Is your head in the sand? Are you flexible enough to get your head in the sand? My suspicion would be no.\u201d Reporter: \u201cProbably not.\u201d Pearson: \u201cI can, you can\u2019t. You can\u2019t.\u201d 16 May 2015 But the Chelsea defeat was just a blip: Leicester\u2019s dramatic recovery continues and they clinch safety with a game to spare, via a 0-0 draw at Sunderland. A final day 5-1 win over QPR completes a run of seven wins from their last nine games and they finish 14th \u2013 becoming only the third Premier League side to survive being bottom at Christmas. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in me trying to flower over it, I was relieved,\u201d says Pearson. \u201cIt\u2019s not been easy. But through it all we\u2019ve managed to stick together. That\u2019s the important thing.\u201d 30 June 2015 The close-season seems to start well. Aiming to cement that togetherness and build on the run-in\u2019s momentum, Pearson makes Robert Huth\u2019s loan move from Stoke permanent, and adds Christian Fuchs from Schalke and Shinji Okazaki from Mainz. But then, suddenly, it implodes. First, three Leicester reserves, including his son, are sacked over a racist sex tape, filmed while on a \u201cgoodwill\u201d tour to Thailand. Then, two weeks later, Pearson himself is out. The owners blame a \u201cfundamental difference in perspective\u201d. 13 July 2015 They turn instead to Claudio Ranieri \u2013 eight months after he was sacked by Greece following a humiliating defeat by the Faroes. Former players aren\u2019t having it. Gary Lineker calls it \u201can uninspiring choice\u201d; Robbie Savage says \u201cnot for me\u201d; and Tony Cottee is \u201castonished \u2026 It\u2019s a strange appointment.\u201d Ranieri signs Caen\u2019s N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and promises: \u201cI will squeeze all my energies into getting the best results.\u201d 13 August 2015 After leading his new side to a 4-2 opening day win over Sunderland, Ranieri faces his first crisis: the club handing Vardy a \u201csubstantial fine\u201d after video emerges of him using a racial slur at a casino in late July. Vardy, who opened the scoring against Sunderland, apologises for \u201ca regrettable error\u201d and keeps his place in the side \u2013 starring in a 2-1 win at West Ham two days later. Ranieri is pleased with the 100% start but plays it cool. \u201cWe can\u2019t think, \u2018oh we are top of the league\u2019. We have six points. That is what is important.\u201d 24 October 2015 Ranieri\u2019s squad, now in fifth but shipping goals, finally keep a clean sheet in a 1-0 win over Palace \u2013 and Ranieri delivers on his pledge to reward them with an afternoon at Peter Pizzeria in Leicester. \u201cThey deserve this pizza and today we will eat,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cFootball is like pizza. The most important ingredient is team spirit and the second is they enjoy training. That is important. Also to sprinkle a little luck is important, like salt. The fans are the tomato. Without the tomato, it\u2019s no pizza.\u201d 28 November 2015 Vardy, in breathtaking form, breaks Ruud van Nistelrooy\u2019s record of scoring in 10 successive Premier League games. \u201cI am really pleased with Jamie,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cWe can all be very proud. But the real target this season is 40 points to be safe, and now we have 11 to go. That is our project.\u201d Leicester go second, level with Manchester City \u2013 but a week later they go top, beating Swansea 3-0 via a dazzling Mahrez hat-trick. \u201cOur fans must keep dreaming,\u201d says the manager, \u201cbut we must stay calm. I just want 40 points.\u201d 19 December 2015 Inspired by a tweet from Lineker (\u201cIf Leicester win the league I\u2019ll do the first MOTD of next season in just my undies\u201d), Leicester win 3-2 at Everton. They reach Christmas Day in first place \u2013 having been bottom 12 months earlier. 2 January 2016 A mini-stumble \u2013 two draws and a defeat to Liverpool, with no goals scored. But a point won at Bournemouth does mean Ranieri can finally tick his box. \u201cIt\u2019s OK! 40 points, clean sheet, champagne for my players.\u201d 2 February 2016 Hollywood writer Adrian Butchart takes a break from his Jamie Vardy movie script to watch from the stands as the striker scores a 25-yard screamer in a 2-0 win over Liverpool. \u201cIt was unbelievable,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cJust unbelievable what Vardy did.\u201d As pundits search for new ways to explain it, The Sun reveals the \u201cspooky stats\u201d that give the credit for Leicester\u2019s win-rate to Richard III. \u201cBefore the incredible discovery of the dead king\u2019s bones in 2012 it was a meagre 32%. Since he was reburied, it\u2019s a phenomenal 63%.\u201d 14 February 2016 A fortnight on, is this the long-anticipated wobble? Ranieri is unhappy with Danny Simpson\u2019s red card in a 2-1 defeat at Arsenal \u2013 but stays composed. \u201cWe carry on, and we smile.\u201d 10 April 2016 But now, after seven more games unbeaten and a gap opening up at the top, it\u2019s all too much. Ranieri is seen in tears of joy after a 2-0 win at Sunderland. He says later: \u201cYou do this job for the emotion you feel inside.\u201d 17 April 2016 Tension, and disbelief, mounts. As Spurs try to stay in touch, referee Jon Moss sends off Vardy in a frantic 2-2 draw with West Ham. Ranieri, though, does what he has done all season: absorbs the pressure, and looks to the positives. \u201cWe are in the Champions League, dilly ding, dilly dong! It\u2019s fantastic.\u201d A week later, without Vardy, they deliver their biggest win of the season, 4-0 over Swansea. It sets them up to win the title at Old Trafford \u2013 five years and 24 hours after Sven\u2019s side were scraping a 1-1 draw at Doncaster. As BBC management give the go-ahead to Lineker presenting in his pants, Ranieri calls for one final heave. \u201cWe must finish this story like an American movie. Be strong. Be solid. This is history.\u201d",

He later reveals he also fancies LA Galaxy\u2019s David Beckham (\u201che would be welcome\u201d), and shares the big vision: \u201cThe target is not only to reach the Premier League but to stay in it.

The owners change course and opt for a familiar face instead: Nigel Pearson rehired 17 months after he left for Hull. \u201cI am prepared to put myself into what is a pressure situation,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t mind that positive pressure. Expectations are high, but that doesn\u2019t faze me.\u201d</p> <h2>30 January 2012 </h2> <p>Pearson adds to Eriksson\u2019s spending, signing Ben Marshall from Stoke, and two others who will have a bigger impact: \u00a31m Danny Drinkwater from Manchester United, and \u00a31m Wes Morgan from Forest.</p> <h2>17 May 2012</h2> <p>Pearson leads his side to an untidy ninth-place finish, with just one win in the final four. The owners sanction another overhaul \u2013 with the most eye-catching move of the summer a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18109906\">\u00a31m deal for prolific 25-year-old Fleetwood striker Jamie Vardy</a>, a record fee for a non-league player. Vardy says he hopes he can make the step up. \u201cI know the standard of the players is going to be a lot better. But I\u2019ve played in the FA Cup a few times this year and managed to do well against the league clubs. Hopefully I can carry that on.\u201d</p> <h2>5 October 2012 </h2> <p>After another mixed start, the owners deny reports that they plan to sack Pearson and hire Harry Redknapp instead. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Nigel-Pearson-staying-say-Leicester-City-s-owners/story-17040259-detail/story.html\">Nigel has and continues to retain our total support</a>, and remains absolutely key to what we are trying to achieve. Our appetite and desire for success with Nigel as manager remains undiminished.\u201d Pearson shrugs it off. \u201cI don\u2019t know who is being mischievous in terms of these stories. It\u2019s a bit of an irritant but it\u2019s not going to alter how I work.\u201d Results stay inconsistent, but they reach Boxing Day in fifth.</p> <h2>21 February 2013</h2> <p>After a fine run of form lifts them to second, a sudden downturn prompts a loan deal: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21533301\">19-year-old Harry Kane arriving from Spurs</a>. \u201cHe\u2019s a player we know a lot about,\u201d says Pearson. \u201cHe will bring goals and a fresh impetus. It keeps the competition keen.\u201d Kane scores on his debut against Blackburn but his presence fails to stop the slide. City approach the final day having dropped outside the play-offs, needing a win away at Forest. But against the odds they do it \u2013 3-2, via a late winner from Anthony Knockaert. It secures sixth place.</p> <h2>12 May 2013</h2> <p>After winning their play-off semi-final first leg 1-0, Leicester travel to Watford, one game from Wembley. It\u2019s a day few will forget. 2-1 down in the 95th-minute, Pearson\u2019s side are given a penalty. Anthony Knockaert steps up \u2013 but Manuel Almunia saves both his shot and his follow-up. Then it gets worse. Watford launch a counterattack, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/12/watford-leicester-city-championship-play-off\">20 seconds later it\u2019s 3-1 to the home side</a>.

Riyad fits that description.\u201d</p> <h2>6 April 2014</h2> <p>With promotion secured and six games still to play, Pearson reveals how he did it \u2013 explaining he had to clear <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/leicester-boss-nigel-pearson-says-3382155\">Sven-Goran Eriksson\u2019s costly \u201crubbish\u201d </a>out of the squad to produce a winning formula. \u201cPeople want to talk about this season in isolation, but I keep telling them it\u2019s actually about what has been done over the last two-and-a-half years. One of the biggest jobs was to get rid of the rubbish \u2013 the players who don\u2019t have any value. We now have lots who can make this step up. I intend to keep them together.\u201d</p> <h2>22 April 2014</h2> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/leicester-city-win-championship-reading-middlesbrough\">1-0 win at Bolton secures the title</a> with two games to spare. They end the season having broken a string of club records, including a brilliant run of nine consecutive league wins. Pearson is named Championship manager of the year, while Schmeichel, Morgan and Drinkwater all make it into the PFA team. The owners, meanwhile, insist they can still comply with Financial Fair Play rules, despite announcing a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/11/leicester-city-finances-football-league-financial-fair-play-investigation\">\u00a334m loss for 2012-13</a>. \u201cWe are highly confident of complying with league regulations.\u201d</p> <h2>25 June 2014</h2> <p>Pearson agrees a three-year contract extension, Vardy signs a four-year deal and summer signings include Villa\u2019s Marc Albrighton, Brighton\u2019s Leonardo Ulloa, former Inter star Esteban Cambiasso and QPR\u2019s Danny Simpson. <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/nigel-pearson-exclusive-leicester-manager-4134388\">Pearson sets out his vision</a> for City\u2019s first season back in the top flight after a 10-year absence and rejects any talk that he might have to drop his low-profile, sitting-in-the-stands approach in favour of a more centre-stage, headline-making role. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I do think there is a lot of pressure on managers to behave in a certain way \u2013 this talk of \u2018passion\u2019 \u2013 which I don\u2019t always think is beneficial. I look at managers and think \u2018Are you acting? Are you playing the role that people want you to play?\u2019 For English managers it is almost as if you have got to act in that \u2018passionate\u2019 way \u2013 there\u2019s more slack cut for foreign coaches because they seem able to look \u2018thoughtful\u2019 \u2026 and then there\u2019s this talk about whether you wear a suit or a tracksuit. I don\u2019t intend changing how I look just because I\u2019m in the Premier League. I will wear a tracksuit.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2>21 September 2014</h2> <p>The promised tidy, low-key start to the season explodes into life with one of the top flight\u2019s great comebacks: Leicester, 3-1 down, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/21/leicester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">beating Manchester United 5\u20133</a>. It\u2019s the first time in 853 Premier League matches that United have surrendered a two-goal lead and lost. Vardy sets up his side\u2019s first, wins two penalties and scores the fourth. \u201cWhen you\u2019re 3-1 down against United, to win the game, I think it\u2019s a decent result,\u201d Pearson says. \u201cIt says a lot about the character. We\u2019ve got a bit more quality than people maybe think.\u201d</p> <h2>7 February 2015</h2> <p>But the feelgood factor fades fast.

In a bizarre moment, he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/07/nigel-pearson-james-mcarthur-leicester-palace\">holds down and mock-strangles Palace\u2019s James McArthur</a> during a 1-0 loss. Asked why he refused to let go, he tells the press: \u201cBecause he said something to me. I\u2019m more than capable of looking after myself.\u201d Pearson is sacked \u2013 only to be reinstated hours later when the owners have a change of heart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"335767ff6b4607083b36eef9467a25c546ee47be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/335767ff6b4607083b36eef9467a25c546ee47be/814_919_2986_1792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pearson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pearson v James McArthur, February 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>14 March 2015</h2> <p>After a 0-0 draw with Hull \u2013 towards the end of an eight-game winless run \u2013 Pearson is asked by a reporter whether his bottom-placed side are \u201cwaxing or waning\u201d in the relegation run-in. \u201cI don\u2019t have to use that sort of analogy,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are in the same position. We\u2019ve got 10 games left, six games at home, and our home form has to be drastically improved to give us the best chance [of staying up]. That\u2019s it. You got any more questions you want to ask? Obviously not. Waxing or waning? Fucking hell.

A final day 5-1 win over QPR completes a run of seven wins from their last nine games and they finish 14th \u2013 becoming only the third Premier League side to survive being bottom at Christmas. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in me trying to flower over it, I was relieved,\u201d says Pearson. \u201cIt\u2019s not been easy. But through it all we\u2019ve managed to stick together. That\u2019s the important thing.\u201d</p> <h2>30 June 2015</h2> <p>The close-season seems to start well. Aiming to cement that togetherness and build on the run-in\u2019s momentum, Pearson makes Robert Huth\u2019s loan move from Stoke permanent, and adds <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/03/leicester-christian-fuchs-free-transfer-austria\">Christian Fuchs from Schalke</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/26/leicester-shinji-okazaki-mainz\">Shinji Okazaki from Mainz</a>.

It sets them up to win the title at Old Trafford \u2013 five years and 24 hours after Sven\u2019s side were scraping a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/13174169.stm\">1-1 draw at Doncaster</a>. As BBC management give the go-ahead to Lineker presenting in his pants, Ranieri calls for one final heave. \u201cWe must finish this story like an American movie. Be strong. Be solid.

      "bodyText": "Residents of the picture postcard Cornish port of St Ives, beloved of artists, surfers and beach lovers, are going to the polls this week in a referendum that may restrict second home ownership. About 12,000 parishioners will be able to vote this Thursday on whether to approve a neighbourhood plan that includes a provision that new-build housing projects would only be given planning permission if they are reserved for people who live in St Ives and surrounding areas full time. Supporters of the idea argue that the housing market is out of control, pricing locals out of St Ives because second home owners have pushed the prices up to an unaffordable level. They say this has eroded the sense of community in the area. Critics of the provision believeit could increase the demand for existing houses, which would not fall under the policy, forcing prices up and putting even more smaller and affordable homes way out of the reach of local people. Andrew Mitchell, a town councillor and supporter of the policy, said ever increasing house prices was causing a \u201cfinancial cleansing\u201d of local people. He insisted, however, that it was not about keeping outsiders out. St Ives has long welcomed incomers, from artists throughout the 20th century to beatniks in the 1960s and surfers and tourists today. \u201cThe policy would only effect new builds. This policy, as wrongly portrayed in the national media, is not to exclude people coming here \u2026 it is to curb excessive development based on financial, speculative grounds and provide community local need development,\u201d Mitchell said. St Ives town council says 25% of residential properties were classed as second homes in 2011, a 67% increase since 2001. Over more than two years, the council and a team of volunteers have worked on the plan, which runs to 108 pages and covers a range of local issues. There is some concern that so much attention has focussed on just one small part, the \u201cfull-time principal residence housing\u201d section. The town clerk, Louise Dowe, called for the plan to be viewed as a whole document and hoped for a good turnout. The effect of the vote could be far-reaching. If the plan is accepted Cornwall council will be legally obliged to follow it when it make planning decisions. Architect Steve McTeare said the plan could send out the wrong message to visitors. In a letter to the St Ives Times &amp; Echo newspaper he wrote: \u201cThe economic lifeblood of the town is tourism; visitors demand a mixed type of accommodation and require places to stay in. The business community from the town thrive on this and the wealth it brings, both in terms of employment and recycling of money into the local economy.\u201d Des Hoskin, of the campaign group Clout \u2013 Carbis Bay and Lelant Opposing Urbanisation Together \u2013 backed the plan: \u201cYes means that we have control over what happens in our beautiful area. A no vote means no control with developers building everywhere.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ken Livingstone persists in mangling facts to suit his argument in his continued attempt to defend his comments on Hitler and Zionism. He took swipes at both \u201cold Blairites\u201d and the media on Saturday, and cited comments made by Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, at the World Zionist Congress, seeming to suggest the comments had been made in recent days and had gone unnoticed by the media. Livingstone seemed unaware that Netanyahu\u2019s remarks, which he cited selectively in his defence, were made in October and caused a storm of controversy both in Israel and internationally. The Israeli prime minister was roundly criticised for suggesting that the grand mufti of Jerusalem, a Palestinian, had persuaded Hitler to exterminate and not just expel Europe\u2019s Jews. His comments were so controversial, in fact, that Netanyahu felt compelled to clarify them: \u201cContrary to the impression that was created, I did not mean to claim that in his conversation with Hitler in November 1941 the Mufti convinced him to adopt the Final Solution. The Nazis decided on that by themselves.\u201d The reality is that Livingstone\u2019s latest attempt to defend his comments that \u201cHitler supported Zionism\u201d in 1932 before going \u201cmad and killing six million Jews\u201d is in line with his previous controversial remarks, invoking dubious history to support his claims. The problem, as others have pointed out, is that Livingstone appears to conflate multiple mistaken notions to suggest Hitler \u201csupported\u201d Zionism \u2013 as if at some stage he had felt positively towards a strand of Jewish political thought which even in the 1930s encapsulated different and competing ideas and individuals. The reality is that Hitler had harboured hostile views towards Jews since the 1920s, which coalesced first in the antisemitism of Mein Kampf, published in the middle of the decade. There is a twisted kernel of truth at the heart of Livingstone\u2019s claims when he alludes to the so-called Haavara (transfer) Agreement, although it took place in 1933 not 1932 as Livingstone suggests. Deeply controversial amid a Jewish European boycott of German trade, it saw an agreement between Germany and German Zionists to facilitate the emigration of Jews to British Mandate Palestine \u2013 not Israel as Livingstone states, which did not exist until 1948 - by ensuring would-be Jewish emigrants could transfer part of their property. As Yf\u2019aat Weiss explains in an essay for the Holocaust Memorial centre at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, the Haavara agreement allowed \u201cGerman Jews emigrating to Palestine to retain some of the value of their property in Germany by purchasing German goods for the Yishuv [the Jewish settlement in Mandatory Palestine], which would redeem them in Palestine local currency\u201d. Its context, as Weiss points out, was as a deal forged under the threat of Nazi persecution. Following the end of Jewish emancipation in Germany, she writes: \u201cGerman Jewry had to formulate survival tactics vis-\u00e0-vis the Nazi government of their own country.\u201d The interest of some in the Zionist movement was to flee the rampant and increasingly dangerous antisemitism of the National Socialists, but the German interest in the Haavara agreement was both fear that the Jewish boycott of Germany might have wider economic effects - ultimately a misplaced anxiety - and a desire to push German Jews to flee. The Haavara agreement was designed to encourage the emigration of Jews from Germany in line with National Socialist policies, but it did not have in mind the foundation of a Jewish state in Palestine, a key tenet of Zionism. Indeed, by late 1937 an anti-Nazi German official involved in administering the agreement suggested that fear in Nazi circles that it might lead to a Jewish state, to which Hitler was implacably opposed, was leading to suggestions \u201cit should be terminated.\u201d Fatally for his garbled argument, in the final analysis Livingstone confuses agency and intention. Hitler wanted neither Jews in Germany nor in their own state. The Nazi vision was for the Jews to be removed from any kind of political influence. He facilitated some emigration in pursuit of a policy of ethnic cleansing to \u201cconcentrate\u201d German Jews elsewhere. None of which amounts \u201cto Hitler\u2019s support for Zionism\u201d, no matter how complex the history. As the Haaretz columnist Anshel Pfeffer summed up Livingstone\u2019s three days of interventions: \u201cHis historical version of the Holocaust was only slightly more bizarre than his contention that someone who only hates Jews living in Israel \u2013 but not outside it \u2013 cannot be considered an anti-Semite.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hans Abrahamsen\u2019s composing career has developed in phases, including a period in the 1990s when he produced nothing new at all. But over the last decade he has written some of the most bewitching music to have emerged from Europe so far this century, works that seem to reinvent familiar musical devices in an utterly original way. Two years ago, the City of Birmingham Symphony gave the British premiere of one of the most extraordinary and exceptionally beautiful of those pieces, the song cycle Let Me Tell You, which Abrahamsen composed for the soprano Barbara Hannigan, using texts from Paul Griffiths\u2019 novel. The success of that piece (which went on to win the hugely prestigious Grawemeyer award, and which the CBSO is bringing to the Proms in August), encouraged the orchestra to be co-commissioners of another piece, Left, Alone, a concerto for piano left hand, which Abrahamsen composed for Alexandre Tharaud, who gave the world premiere in Cologne in January. Tharaud was the wonderfully agile soloist at Symphony Hall, too, with Ilan Volkov conducting. Abrahamsen himself was born with restricted use of his right hand so that, as he says, he has always had a \u201ca close relationship\u201d with those piano works, like the Ravel concerto, composed for left hand alone. None of those pieces, though, deals with the challenge of writing such a work in the way that Left, Alone does so memorably. As the title suggests, it\u2019s music of solitariness, in which the piano\u2019s lonely melodic line (which only very rarely becomes chordal) weaves its way through the glittering and grumbling thickets of canons and cross rhythms that the orchestra creates, trying to establish its own identity. It regularly finds itself stranded, without support, and only in the last of the six short movements is there some kind of reconciliation between the two. All this takes place in the special airy sound world that Abrahamsen has invented for himself, full of textures that can hang suspended in the orchestral stratosphere or plunge at any moment to the lowest depths that instruments can inhabit. Before the concerto, too, there was the chance to hear that world taken on in the work of another supreme musical colourist, as Volkov conducted Abrahamsen\u2019s orchestration of Debussy\u2019s Children\u2019s Corner, which renders that suite of piano pieces into astonishing miniature tours de force, each one with its own carefully defined range of sonorities, that seem at the same time to belong to two very different musical worlds. After these two pieces, even the colours of Mahler\u2019s Fourth Symphony seemed rather routine, though Volkov\u2019s performance was anything but. There was no sense of Knaben Wunderhorn cosiness here, but a dark undertow to every movement, which the CBSO realised very faithfully. Sarah Tynan was the silvery soprano soloist in the last movement, though after the menace that Volkov had found elsewhere in the symphony, her child\u2019s view of heaven, in which oxen are slaughtered and lambs led to their deaths, seemed anything but reassuring.",

      "body": "<p><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/long-bio/hans-abrahamsen\">Hans Abrahamsen</a>\u2019s composing career has developed in phases, including a period in the 1990s when he produced nothing new at all. But over the last decade he has written some of the most bewitching music to have emerged from Europe so far this century, works that seem to reinvent familiar musical devices in an utterly original way. </p> <p>Two years ago, the City of Birmingham Symphony gave the British premiere of one of the most extraordinary and exceptionally beautiful of those pieces, the song cycle <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/19/cbso-nelsons-review-barbara-hannigan-abrahamsen\">Let Me Tell You</a>, which Abrahamsen composed for the soprano Barbara Hannigan, using texts from Paul Griffiths\u2019 novel. The success of that piece (which went on to win the hugely prestigious Grawemeyer award, and which the CBSO is bringing to the Proms in August), encouraged the orchestra to be co-commissioners of another piece, Left, Alone, a concerto for piano left hand, which Abrahamsen composed for <a href=\"http://www.alexandretharaud.com/\">Alexandre Tharaud</a>, who gave the world premiere in Cologne in January. Tharaud was the wonderfully agile soloist at Symphony Hall, too, with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://maestroarts.com/artists/ilan-volkov\">Ilan Volkov</a> conducting. </p> <p>Abrahamsen himself was born with restricted use of his right hand so that, as he says, he has always had a \u201ca close relationship\u201d with those piano works, like the Ravel concerto, composed for left hand alone. None of those pieces, though, deals with the challenge of writing such a work in the way that Left, Alone does so memorably. As the title suggests, it\u2019s music of solitariness, in which the piano\u2019s lonely melodic line (which only very rarely becomes chordal) weaves its way through the glittering and grumbling thickets of canons and cross rhythms that the orchestra creates, trying to establish its own identity. It regularly finds itself stranded, without support, and only in the last of the six short movements is there some kind of reconciliation between the two.</p> <p>All this takes place in the special airy sound world that Abrahamsen has invented for himself, full of textures that can hang suspended in the orchestral stratosphere or plunge at any moment to the lowest depths that instruments can inhabit. Before the concerto, too, there was the chance to hear that world taken on in the work of another supreme musical colourist, as Volkov conducted Abrahamsen\u2019s orchestration of Debussy\u2019s Children\u2019s Corner, which renders that suite of piano pieces into astonishing miniature tours de force, each one with its own carefully defined range of sonorities, that seem at the same time to belong to two very different musical worlds.</p> <p>After these two pieces, even the colours of Mahler\u2019s Fourth Symphony seemed rather routine, though Volkov\u2019s performance was anything but. There was no sense of Knaben Wunderhorn cosiness here, but a dark undertow to every movement, which the CBSO realised very faithfully. <a href=\"http://www.sarahtynan.com/tablet/index.html\">Sarah Tynan</a> was the silvery soprano soloist in the last movement, though after the menace that Volkov had found elsewhere in the symphony, her child\u2019s view of heaven, in which oxen are slaughtered and lambs led to their deaths, seemed anything but reassuring.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For more than a decade, smart guns have been stuck in a Catch-22: personalized guns don\u2019t have a proven market, and buyers don\u2019t want a gun they think is untested or hard to find. Now Barack Obama is trying to break that stalemate by creating a market for smart guns among law enforcement agencies around the US. Some gun rights advocates view smart guns with suspicion, fearing that the new technology will be pushed on gun owners unwillingly, as a New Jersey law tried to do in 2002. The guns use fingerprint sensors or RFID tags to prevent the weapons from being fired by anyone except an authorized user. \u201cAs long as we\u2019ve got the technology to prevent a criminal from stealing and using your smartphone, then we should be able to prevent the wrong person from pulling a trigger on a gun,\u201d the president wrote in a White House Facebook post late last week. In a Friday report, touted by the White House as a milestone in the president\u2019s uphill battle to reduce gun violence, federal agencies said they were working with law enforcement officials to develop standards for smart guns that could be used by police officers. Once those new standards are released, the agencies will encourage law enforcement officers to volunteer to test smart guns in the field. They have promised that federal funding will be available to help police departments and other agencies buy new guns. If the technology can meet the standards \u2013 and if agencies can cooperate \u2013 the purchasing power of the federal government could be an enormous boost to the nascent industry. Executives \u201cwho are saying they are ready, wiling, and able to make a smart gun have been saying, \u2018All that we need is a purchase order that\u2019s large enough to turn the machines on,\u2019\u201d said Stephen Teret, a leading smart gun expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He called the White House\u2019s smart gun plan \u201cwonderful\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s very measured and logical and it doesn\u2019t force anyone to do anything,\u201d he said. In advance of the White House report, some law enforcement officials had expressed trepidation that police officers would be forced to use the new guns, with one national police union official telling Politico that officers \u201cshouldn\u2019t be asked to be the guinea pigs in evaluating a firearm that nobody\u2019s even seen yet\u201d. The smart gun report, produced by the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Homeland Security, said the smart gun push was \u201cnot a mandate that any particular individual or law enforcement agency adopt the technology once developed\u201d. According to the White House\u2019s report, law enforcement agencies \u201cwill be invited to make voluntary commitments\u201d about developing or buying smart guns. Agencies could volunteer, for instance, to buy a small number of smart guns to conduct a pilot program. Jonathan Mossberg, the CEO of iGun Technology Corporation, a Florida-based company that has developed a smart shotgun, said the White House\u2019s push to support new gun technology could be a \u201cwindfall\u201d for smart gun companies. He said his push to bring a smart gun to market had stalled since around 2002. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to raise money, and I think this could make it a while lot easier to raise money,\u201d he said. \u201cMore people can see the size of the market.\u201d But Mossberg said he also worried that the White House\u2019s push, particularly the pledge to subsidize the cost for departments that want to buy the new guns, would create an \u201cartificial market\u201d for smart guns. \u201cLet\u2019s say a gun company who has been against this type of development now sees an artificial market bolstered by the government,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could pour all their resources into developing the technology and leapfrog over people like me.\u201d Teret, the Johns Hopkins expert, compared Obama\u2019s smart gun push to a 1968 pledge from Dr William Hadden, then the head of a federal highway safety agency, that the government would work collaboratively the the automobile industry to improve safety by adding airbags to cars. Hadden said the government \u201cwould act as a midwife to help deliver the airbags\u201d, Teret recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s what President Obama is saying. He\u2019s saying the government can help with the delivery of the product to the marketplace.\u201d Polls have found conflicting data about the support for smart guns among consumers. One 2013 firearms industry poll suggested only 14% of respondents would be likely to buy a smart gun; a more recent poll sponsored by public health researchers found that 43% of gun owners would consider buying a childproof handgun that could only be fired by its authorized user. Law enforcement agencies were a challenging initial marketplace for smart gun adoption, Teret said, because police officers had \u201cheightened needs\u201d when it came to their guns. A police officer\u2019s firearm \u201chas to work when the policeman is wearing gloves. It has to be able to work if he\u2019s running through a swamp. It has to be able to work in zero degrees or 100 degrees. It has to work if it\u2019s clogged with mud,\u201d he said. A 1996 report on smart guns found the technology \u201cwas not quite ready for policemen\u201d, Teret said. Since then, he said, \u201cready for policemen\u201d has become the gold standard for gun consumers, with some gun owners arguing, \u201cIf they\u2019re not reliable enough for policemen, they\u2019re not reliable enough for me.\u201d Teret said that it might make sense to try to market smart guns to more tech-savvy consumers, the kind of people who want the latest iPad, as well as trying to make inroads into law enforcement market. One small 2003 study of unintentional gun deaths found that 37% of them could have been prevented with a personalized gun. The widespread consumer adoption of smart guns might also change the dynamics of America\u2019s illegal gun market, by making it difficult or impossible to use a gun stolen from its legal owner. Teret said that researchers did not have a clear estimate for how many gun deaths and injuries the widespread adoption of smart gun technology could prevent. But he said the personalized technology had the potential of reducing accidental shootings, suicides and homicides. \u201cAs long as we have a chance to reduce those gun deaths in a substantial way, why shouldn\u2019t we do that?\u201d he said. The National Rifle Association said it did not oppose smart gun technology. \u201cWe\u2019re not against the development of smart guns \u2013 we\u2019re against the mandated use,\u201d NRA spokesman Lars Dalseide said. But the NRA did not welcome Obama\u2019s smart gun plan with particular warmth. \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s obsession with gun control knows no boundaries,\u201d Jennifer Baker, director of public affairs for the NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement Friday. \u201cAt a time when we are actively fighting terrorists at home and abroad, this administration would rather focus the military\u2019s efforts on the president\u2019s gun control agenda.\u201d The White House promised to release initial specifications for a law enforcement-approved smart gun on 15 July, and the final version of the specifications by 15 October. The White House also announced Friday that the social security administration was moving forward with a plan to submit some of its records to the nation\u2019s background check system for gun sales, and that the White House would host a conference in May to talk to local leaders from all 50 states about gun violence prevention strategies.",

      "bodyText": "First things first. Caroline Pidgeon, Liberal Democrat candidate for London mayor and for the 25-strong London Assembly, denies being the source of the cold that her fellow frontline candidates have all caught during the long months of campaigning all over the capital\u2019s 600 square miles. It is a baseless allegation from a rival, she indulgently maintains. \u201cIt was Zac Goldsmith who caught it first,\u201d Pidgeon says. \u201cUnfortunately, it was me who ended up needing antibiotics.\u201d It is unfortunate too for Pidgeon that the surpassing ugliness into which the battle between the frontrunners Goldsmith, the Conservative Party candidate, and Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan has degenerated has meant her offer to the capital has received even less attention than it was always likely to. Having already served two terms on the Assembly, she is entitled to claim that she has direct experience of how City Hall works that all others seeking the top job lack. Yet that job, its powers, responsibilities and potential, have been all but wiped off the media agenda, initially by the smear strategy of the wretched Goldsmith campaign, and now by the crass behaviour of Ken Livingstone. For all that, Pidgeon, her cold in the past, sounds as upbeat now as when I interviewed her back in January. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s gone well. Ordinary people are saying they like what I\u2019m saying on childcare and cheaper fares that are affordable. And that\u2019s not just in places where we are strong, like Sutton, or in Bermondsey, where I\u2019m known.\u201d The former Southwark councillor has been arguing for setting up a mayoral house-building company to directly deliver Greater London Authority equivalents of 50,000 council homes and to raise finance towards supplying another 150,000 dwellings. She\u2019s pledged to increase the congestion charge, pilot a new, separate scheme around Heathrow and place curbs on heavy goods and construction vehicles in Central London. She wants more vigorous action on cleaning up polluting buses and taxis too, along with stronger regulation of Uber. The mother of a two year-old called Henry, she\u2019s also set out plans for improving childcare provision, which include raising \u00a350m through a voluntary \u201ctourism tax\u201d on London hotel guests. The cost of childcare remains an under recognised element of London\u2019s high cost of living, as the single parent charity Gingerbread has shown. How will Pidgeon get on when Londoners vote on Thursday? Opinion polls have shown her, Sian Berry of the Greens and Ukip\u2019s Peter Whittle in a single-figure cluster vying for third place, although London borough by election results since last year\u2019s general election have seen the Lib Dem vote share pick up significantly. In Europhile London, being passionately pro-Europe might work in her favour, though Khan and Berry are in the Remain camp too. She says it hasn\u2019t really been a factor when meeting people, though \u201clinking the two together motivates my campaigners.\u201d She adds: \u201cIt might affect Liberal Democrat voters\u2019 second preferences. Would you trust a candidate who wants to pull out of Europe?\u201d Goldsmith is for Brexit. Pidgeon is, as you\u2019d expect, disparaging about the campaigns of both Goldsmith and Khan. \u201cThey don\u2019t have much to say. They\u2019re almost fearful of saying anything.\u201d A chair and a vice chair of the Assembly\u2019s transport committee, she has maintained throughout that Khan\u2019s proposed across-the-board four year fares freeze is unaffordable. She expresses surprise that the fight between him and Goldsmith \u201cgot so dirty so early,\u201d and anticipates that it will cause regrets. \u201cI think both of them, but particularly Zac, will wish they hadn\u2019t done it.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has denied reports that it will seek to determine BBC scheduling following reports that it will bar the broadcaster from showing popular programmes such as Strictly Come Dancing at peak viewing times. Labour had accused John Whittingdale, the media and culture secretary, of \u201cunacceptable interference\u201d in the BBC before the publication of a white paper that will set out a new regime as part of a proposed deal to renew its royal charter for another 11 years. The BBC has voiced concerns at moves it says will undermine its independence, particularly about plans for the government to directly appoint most members of a new body to run the corporation instead of the BBC Trust. Whittingdale has said the charter was looking at whether the BBC should continue to be \u201call things to all people\u201d, or whether it should have a more \u201cprecisely targeted\u201d output mission. He has previously expressed concerns about the flagship news bulletin being broadcast at the same time as ITV\u2019s. ITV has complained about licence fee money being used to wage a ratings battle with it and other commercial channels. The Mail on Sunday quoted a government source as saying it would be \u201cobvious when ITV had a flagship programme they were hoping to get high ratings for and where it would be unfair for the BBC to take it on head-to-head\u201d. The shadow culture secretary, Maria Eagle, said: \u201cJohn Whittingdale is behaving as if he were running the BBC \u2013 he is not. This kind of meddling in day-to-day scheduling decisions would be a completely unacceptable interference in the independence of the BBC. Labour will fight it all the way. \u201cThe public will wonder why the government is interfering with the BBC, and why they are trying to dictate when they can schedule hugely popular programmes like Strictly Come Dancing.\u201d However, a spokesman from the Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport said: \u201cThe government will be setting out its plan on the BBC charter in a white paper in May. The secretary of state has made it clear on a number of occasions that the government cannot, and indeed should not, determine either the content or scheduling of programmes.\u201d A BBC source said: \u201cLet\u2019s see what the white paper says. The BBC doesn\u2019t aggressively schedule, but we do show programmes at the times people want to watch them. \u201cResearch has shown that an element of competition drives up quality across the industry and the public would be deeply concerned if the BBC\u2019s ability to show programmes such as Strictly, Doctor Who, and Sherlock at the times convenient to them were taken away. It would be odd to make it harder for people to find and watch the programmes they have already paid for.\u201d The BBC has also questioned ITV\u2019s scheduling tactics, saying it screened the second series of Broadchurch to go head-to-head with its popular Silent Witness drama series in January 2015. The salaries of stars could reportedly be made public for the first time. The BBC says its talent pay is already published in bands and that a review commissioned by the BBC Trust found the broadcaster had reduced spending on pay for top talent by 29% in five years, and overall spending on talent by 15%.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A British man who was among 13 people killed in a helicopter crash in Norway has been named locally as Iain Stuart. Stuart, 41, from Laurencekirk in Aberdeenshire, worked for the oilfield services company Halliburton. He was believed to be on a Super Puma carrying two crew and 11 passengers from the North Sea Gullfaks B oilfield, 74 miles (120km) off the Norwegian coast, to Flesland airport in Bergen when it crashed on Friday. All commercial passenger flights by the model of the Super Puma involved in the crash \u2013 an Airbus EC225LP \u2013 have been grounded in the UK by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), mirroring action taken by its Norwegian counterpart. BP and Statoil have also suspended the use of the aircraft model after the accident, so it is unable to carry oil and gas workers, the BBC reports. Tributes have been paid to Stuart, who was a member of Brechin golf club, where a flag flew at half mast on Saturday. Stephen Rennie, the resident golf professional and manager, told the Mail on Sunday: \u201cThe whole club is shocked and saddened to hear the devastating news about Iain. He was a very popular member of the club and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time.\u201d A family friend, Charles Aitken, 75, said: \u201cMy daughter knows his wife, Amy. They are a really lovely family \u2013 it\u2019s an absolute tragedy.\u201d In tributes posted on social media, Stuart was described as \u201calways a gent\u201d and \u201ca top bloke\u201d. Statoil said the pilots of the helicopter \u2013 a Norwegian and an Italian \u2013 were staff of CHC Helicopter. The 10 other Norwegian passengers were employed by companies including Schlumberger, Aker Solutions and Statoil. Their names have not yet been released. The aircraft shattered into pieces when it smashed into the rocky shoreline of Tur\u00f8y, a tiny island outside Bergen, Norway\u2019s second-largest city. Norwegian television showed footage of what appeared to be a helicopter rotor blade spiralling down minutes before the helicopter crashed. A witness, Rebecca Andersen, told the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang that the helicopter\u2019s \u201crotor blades came rushing toward us \u2026 Then we heard a violent explosion.\u201d Emergency crews pulled the wrecked fuselage out of the sea on Saturday before an investigation into the cause of the crash. A team from the UK\u2019s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has gone to the site. The Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, wrote on Twitter about the \u201chorrifying reports\u201d and said she was being kept informed about the rescue work. She said her thoughts went out to all those who had lost a loved one. EC225 Super Puma helicopters were previously grounded in the UK after two crashes in Scotland in 2012. Both incidents, in which all passengers and crew were rescued, were blamed on gearbox problems. The aircraft were allowed to resume flying in August 2013. Later that month a different model of Super Puma, the AS332 L2, crashed off Shetland, killing four people.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cI started photographing megachurches as an oppositional idea,\u201d explains Lisa Anne Auerbach, a California photographer and artist. \u201cI had been doing a series about small freestanding businesses [encapsulating] this idea of America: you\u2019re an individual, you hang up your shingle, you pick yourself up by your bootstrap, and become your own fantasy. I was thinking about megachurches being another part of the American dream \u2013 faith and family and community.\u201d Using a database published by Hartford Seminary, a theological college in Connecticut, Auerbach catalogued megachurches \u2013 \u201cand I use their definition for this\u201d, she stresses \u2013 in Protestant denominations, which claim to have weekly congregations of over 2,000 people. Auerbach also subscribed to Outreach magazine, a publication aimed at those who run churches, which has listings of megachurches. The top 50 in the country have more than 10,000 worshippers a week. Auerbach\u2019s project was driven by her bafflement at America\u2019s evangelical Christian demographic. \u201cWe hear about America being 90% Christian, or some crazy number, and as an artist living in Los Angeles, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m in touch with at all,\u201d she says. \u201cI had been reading about megachurches in the press, mostly in relationship to politics, and thinking: who are these people that are going to these places, that are buying this conservative agenda?\u201d With anthropological curiosity, Auerbach started exploring the phenomenon in proximity to her home, but always brought her camera when travelling elsewhere. So far, she has photographed megachurches in Florida, Arizona, Michigan, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina and California. Initially planning to make big prints of the megachurches, she reasoned: \u201cIf you walk into a room full of them, it\u2019s going to look like a recruitment \u2013 the opposite of what I wanted.\u201d So she decided to make a jumbo zine, which she dubs a \u201cmegazine\u201d, scaling up the traditional half-letter-size format to 60in. She has made three such megazines in total: one on psychics, two on megachurches. Auerbach\u2019s megachurch megazine is currently on view in a Paris exhibition called Wasteland: New Art from Los Angeles, a reference to the famed TS Eliot poem. The relationship between architecture, landscape and religion seems particularly strange from a European perspective. The conception of the cathedral is not only where one goes to be spiritual or commune with God, but to feel awe through the grandeur of the architecture and the building\u2019s history. Comparatively, the US megachurch buildings are stripped wholesale of that sense of wonder and connection to the past; they are also far from the focal point of a city. \u201cNotre Dame is a cathedral in the center of the city,\u201d says Auerbach. \u201cWhereas these churches, although they\u2019re very powerful, are hidden. The reason they\u2019re hidden, I found, is that they\u2019re camouflaged. They look like places we just drive by. They\u2019re in office parks; they\u2019re in former big box stores. I thought that was fascinating: I don\u2019t even know what to look for. That was the impetus to say: what is this thing?\u201d In tandem with the photographs, Auerbach provides statistics on purported congregation size and denomination, as well as church location and name. Some nomenclature is so fanciful as to seem fabricated (or at least worthy of the Onion): Love International Ministries, Potential Church, Life Changers International, Pilgrim Rest. Auerbach jotted down personal anecdotes about her experience, to \u201cflesh out the photographs a little bit\u201d. She noted bad puns, such as \u201cthou shalt not park here\u201d signs in a lot, and a church coffee shop called He Brews. She observed that the sign reading \u201cchapel\u201d was the exact dimension and typeface as the one adjacently announcing \u201crestrooms\u201d. She noticed a mosaic cross juxtaposed directly above a garbage can, and a church parking lot \u201csuspiciously filled with single men sitting in their cars and pickup trucks\u201d. Encountering an outdoor baptismal tub, she wondered if people ever repurposed it for a refreshing summer dip (\u201cIf you\u2019re already baptized, can you do it just to cool down?\u201d) She stumbled on a drive-through prayer center in Arizona, where members \u201cprayed for my photo project while I took the photo\u201d. The images are characterized by an acute eeriness \u2013 Auerbach purposefully photographed the spaces on weekdays, while more or less vacant. \u201cI don\u2019t want the presence of people to get in the way of looking at the space,\u201d she says. Auerbach also provides field notes about the church\u2019s accessibility (or lack thereof), who was lurking and the general vicinity: billboards, furniture stores, McDonald\u2019s, minimarts, mega-mansions, grim apartment buildings, soccer fields, freeways and expressways. From the outset, Auerbach\u2019s mission was above all a visual one. Her photographic influences \u2013 William Christenberry, Walker Evans, Lewis Baltz, (\u201call the New Topographics stuff\u201d) \u2013 are apparent: like them, she provides a matter-of-fact look at the commonplace American landscape. \u201cI wanted them to be traditionally beautiful photos, despite being weird,\u201d she emphasizes. \u201cI knew these places are around, but I was like: have I seen them? Would I recognize them? Is it part of my commute and I don\u2019t acknowledge it, because I don\u2019t know what to look for? It came from curiosity.\u201d Her descriptions of the churches she encountered range from funny to uneasy. She finds edifices evocative of a hospital, greenhouse, plastic toy, warehouse, Old West movie set, bunker and low brown turtle. Recurring adjectives include bland, industrial, sterile and Disney-like; materials include stucco, tile, stone, concrete, cinder block and unsightly brick. The drab architecture reflects the monolithic nature of church theologies: \u201cUnlike the small businesses, which felt very individualistic, and about creating your own world view, the church felt more about power, about converting people, so they could have wealth.\u201d The featureless buildings concealed in plain sight indicate the way evangelical America works: disguised within the quotidian landscape, pumping commercial spaces with pious significance. \u201cWHERE WILL YOU SPEND ETERNITY?\u201d one of the photographed places of worship challenges ominously. It\u2019s a loaded question for something just off the expressway. In the context of the election and the fever pitch of conservative voices, the project takes on added resonance \u2013 on an electoral level as well as an anthropological one. Auerbach says: \u201cI started photographing soon after the 2008 election, because I started reading about how megachurch members were determining polls in various places. It\u2019s against the law for churches to promote candidates, but they preach around that, as closely as they can.\u201d Auerbach is thinking of driving across the country during the upcoming national election, but admits: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can handle it.\u201d She is thinking of making a megazine about cats instead.",

She finds edifices evocative of a hospital, greenhouse, plastic toy, warehouse, Old West movie set, bunker and low brown turtle. Recurring adjectives include bland, industrial, sterile and Disney-like; materials include stucco, tile, stone, concrete, cinder block and unsightly brick. The drab architecture reflects the monolithic nature of church theologies: \u201cUnlike the small businesses, which felt very individualistic, and about creating your own world view, the church felt more about power, about converting people, so they could have wealth.\u201d</p> <p>The featureless buildings concealed in plain sight indicate the way evangelical America works: disguised within the quotidian landscape, pumping commercial spaces with pious significance. \u201cWHERE WILL YOU SPEND ETERNITY?\u201d one of the photographed places of worship challenges ominously.

Auerbach says: \u201cI started photographing soon after the 2008 election, because I started reading about how megachurch members were determining polls in various places. It\u2019s against the law for churches to promote candidates, but they preach around that, as closely as they can.\u201d Auerbach is thinking of driving across the country during the upcoming national election, but admits: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can handle it.\u201d She is thinking of making a megazine about cats instead.</p>",

Lewis-Stempel has 70 acres spread over five lots, but this volume, the latest capitalising on the vogue for nature writing, tells the story of the acquisition of 15 new acres on a two-year farm business tenancy. The parcel included an arable field, and the author sets about, over the course of a year, sowing wheat and wildflowers. Where possible, he follows traditional ways, often deploying non-traditional methods to achieve his goals: he buys an antique seed fiddle on eBay for \u00a3150 and cuts his wheat into sheaves rather than bales. The diary form of The Running Hare facilitates impressionistic and spontaneous prose as the rural year unfurls. Problems queue up for recognition, of course, but Lewis-Stempel ploughs on (sorry), sowing, among other things, to encourage the eponymous hare. And the animal comes. \u201cHave hares, have our national landscape.\u201d Readers who enjoyed the author\u2019s last book, Meadowland: The Private Life of an English Field, will find much in the same vein here: a mix of agricultural history, rural lore, topographical description and childhood memories. I learned a good deal. I had no idea that traditionally in the countryside sexual abstinence prevailed from Advent till Candlemas (2 February) in order to avoid heavy pregnancies at harvest time. Or that the ploughman\u2019s lunch was invented by the Cheese Bureau in the 50s. At his best, Lewis-Stempel is a fine stylist, adroitly conjuring scenes in which \u201cmedieval mist hangs in the trees\u201d or \u201cfrost clenches the ground\u201d. He uses the dramatic present, always tricky, and on the whole pulls it off. The conversational tone can be less successful: I don\u2019t care for \u201cI kid you not\u201d in a proper book, or \u201csorted\u201d. Cliches sprout like the ears of wheat: \u201cYou can take the boy off the farm, but you can\u2019t take the farm out of the boy.\u201d But Lewis-Stempel quotes widely and judiciously from folk songs and literature (Gerard Manley Hopkins, John Clare, Edward Thomas). His passion for the Herefordshire countryside sings from these pages. He says that a bond he formed with a crow in his field was \u201cone of the greatest privileges in my life\u201d. There is a political dimension. Identifying as an \u201cenvironmentalist\u201d, Lewis-Stempel asserts his moral superiority over his neighbours \u201cthe Chemical Brothers\u201d and states that \u201cevery time one buys the lie of cheap food a flower or a bird dies\u201d. But the cheap food he so despises is all that is affordable to many. Regrettably, a whiff of class privilege hovers over these pages. That said, there are no glib solutions here to the problems we have created, and this is not a campaigning book. Lewis-Stempel is a realist. He thinks George Monbiot\u2019s \u201crewilding\u201d mission is an idea that should \u201cget into the fucking sea with the red herrings\u201d; it is \u201cat best, fiddling at the edges of Britain\u2019s environmental problems\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The devastating epidemic of drug overdose deaths in the US has led to an increase in organ donors, data from the federal government shows. As the death rate from drug overdoses surged in the US over the last several years, the number of organ donors who died from overdoses increased from 1.1% of all deceased organ donors in 2000 to 9.34% in 2015, according to government data. These numbers reflect a marginal improvement in one public health crisis \u2013 22 people die each day waiting for an organ transplant \u2013 spurred by the damage of another. The rate of deaths from drug overdoses has increased 137% since 2000, including a 200% increase in the rate of overdose deaths involving opioids. This has raised questions about the safety of collecting organs from people who die of drug overdoses, though transplant surgeons say the risks of contracting disease from such patients is low. Nikole Neidlinger, a transplant surgeon and medical adviser for the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations (AOPO), said that when doctors tell patients the risk of transmitting a virus from a donor with behavioral risk factors, such as drug abuse, is low, patients usually have the same response. \u201cWhen that incidence is dramatically lower than your incidence of dying on the waitlist, most patients will say yes,\u201d said Neidlinger. But patients have contracted viruses from organ donations before \u2013 and it can be fatal. In 2007, four people contracted HIV and hepatitis C from the organs of a deceased person. And in 2004, four people died from rabies after receiving infected organs or tissue from a donor who doctors had thought had died from a drug overdose, but had actually died of rabies. These incidences are rare, however, and pale in comparison to the risk of being on the organ donation waitlist, which includes more than 77,800 people. In 2015, organs were only recovered from 9,080 deceased people. Despite the jump in organ donations from people who died of drug overdoses, the main cause of death for deceased organ donors is still blunt injuries, cardiovascular causes and stroke, which accounts for the cause of death of 30.43% of deceased organ donors. Helen M Nelson, the New England Organ Bank\u2019s senior vice president of organ donation services, told US News and World Report that drug overdose deaths were not as sudden as the more common causes of death for organ donors. \u201cMany of the families we encounter have been going through this addiction for several years,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if the families were preparing for this death; many feel great comfort in knowing that some good has come out of it.\u201d",

Her relationship with her husband Harvey was unstable at the time and the death of her daughter was piled onto that. But this is not the story of Sandra Berkely nor her husband Harvey but the story of Hayley and Taylor Ryan. They were devastated by the death of their friend who was their former best friend. They had known eachother since kindergarten. The three of them survived the crash and then Katelyn had to be killed by an espresso machine. The twins Hay-Tay (as Beth would say) would not stop investigating the death of their friend with their twin telepathy, crime-writer dad and their secret talent. Ok, so I don\u2019t want to spoil the rest of the story but I loved this book. At first I thought, no, she can\u2019t die in the first chapter! I love how Olsen used so many twists that you could never be sure what was going to happen next. He was extremely detailed with his descriptions, which was surprising because mainly all the characters were girls; it was almost as if he were writing his own story. At times, especially at the beginning, I couldn\u2019t pick up the book and keep reading.

      "bodyText": "Greece is running out of money. The government in Athens is raiding the budgets of the health service and public utilities to pay salaries and pensions. Without fresh financial support it will struggle to make a debt payment due in July. No, this is not a piece from the summer of 2015 reprinted by mistake. Greece, after a spell out of the limelight, is back. Another summer of threats, brinkmanship and all-night summits looms. The problem is a relatively simple one. Greece is bridling at the unrealistic demands of the European commission and the International Monetary Fund to agree to fresh austerity measures when, as the IMF itself accepts, hospitals are running out of syringes and buses don\u2019t run because of a lack of spare parts. Athens has already pushed through a package of austerity measures worth \u20ac5.4bn (\u00a34.23bn) as the price of receiving an \u20ac86bn bailout agreed at the culmination of last summer\u2019s protracted crisis and expected the deal to be finalised last October. Disbursements of the loan have been held up, however, because neither the commission or the IMF believe that Greece will make the promised savings. So they are demanding that Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government legislate for additional \u201ccontingency measures\u201d worth \u20ac3.6bn to be triggered in the event that Greece fails to meet its fiscal targets. This is almost inevitable, given that the target is for the country to run a primary budget surplus of 3.5% of gross domestic product by 2018 and in every year thereafter. This means that once Greece\u2019s debt payments are excluded, tax receipts have to exceed public spending by 3.5% of GDP. The exceptionally onerous terms are supposed to whittle away Greece\u2019s debt mountain, currently just shy of 200% of GDP. If this all sounds like Alice in Wonderland economics, then that\u2019s because it is. Greece is being set budgetary targets that the IMF knows are unrealistic and is being set up to fail. It will then be punished further for being unable to do what was impossible in the first place. Predictably enough, the government in Athens is not especially taken with this idea. It has described the idea as outlandish and unconstitutional, but is in a weak position because it desperately needs the bailout loan and threw away its only real bargaining chip last year by making it clear that it would stay in the single currency whatever the price. So Tsipras is doing what he did last year. He is playing for time, hopeful that by hanging tough and threatening another summer of chaos he can force Europe\u2019s leaders to offer him a better deal - less onerous deficit reduction measures coupled with a decent slug of debt relief. For the time being though, the matter is being handled by the eurozone\u2019s finance ministers, who want their full pound of flesh. The mood is especially unyielding in Germany, where Angela Merkel\u2019s popularity has suffered as a result of her open door policy toward refugees. Faced with growing hostility, she has concluded that this is not the time to show any signs of weakness. She has sought to mollify German voters by giving her finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, a free hand to ratchet up his criticism of the stimulus policies Mario Draghi is pursuing at the European Central Bank, and by insisting that there should be no debt relief for Greece until Tsipras has done everything demanded of him. Merkel must pray that the lid can be kept on Greece until after 23 June, because it is hard to see how a repeat of last summer\u2019s argy-bargy would help keep Britain inside the EU - rather more important to Germany in the long term than a few billion euros of debt relief. The reason is that David Cameron can only win his referendum by securing the votes of non-Conservative supporters, for some of whom the handling of Greece exemplifies everything that is wrong with the EU - its lack of democracy, hyper-conservative economic agenda and insistence that the single currency is a great success when in fact it has proved to be a colossal failure. Greece received the first of its three bailouts six years ago, when the terms were negotiated in the weekend following Britain\u2019s general election. Gordon Brown was on his way out, but the then chancellor Alistair Darling went to Brussels to discuss the deal with fellow EU finance ministers. Since then, there have changes of government in all the big EU countries bar Germany, and most of the smaller ones as well. Voters showed their unhappiness by getting rid of the centre-right in France and the centre-left in Spain. They waved goodbye to Silvio Berlusconi in Italy and Mark Rutte in the Netherlands. It has been all change at local level, but no change in Brussels and Frankfurt, where the officials responsible for the eurozone\u2019s bone-headed policies carry on regardless. Voters across Europe have got the message from the way Greece\u2019s opposition to austerity was crushed - you can vote for whoever you like, but it won\u2019t make any difference. The revolt against the status quo explains why Spain can\u2019t form a government, the two parties that have dominated Irish politics since independence could barely muster more than 50% of the vote in the recent election, the runoff for president in Austria is between the greens and the far right and Marine Le Pen has support in France. To be sure, this is not a phenomenon exclusive to the eurozone. There is marked hostility to the US political establishment, and it is clear that many voters in the UK simply do not believe the government\u2019s warnings about the economic risks of Brexit. The situation in the eurozone is worse, however, in part because the democratic deficit is so marked, in part because economic performance has been woeful and in part because there has been a dogged insistence on continuing with policies that have been both ineffective and unpopular. As Dan Atkinson and I argue in our forthcoming book about the failure of the single currency,* Greece was the point where progressive illusions were shattered. Until last summer it was just about possible to believe in a cuddly European polity dedicated to higher living standards, full employment and more generous welfare states. Then a gun was held to Greece\u2019s head. Tsipras was faced with a choice. Ignore what the people want or see your banks go bust. This in a country which had seen the economy shrink by a quarter in five years. Difficult to spot what was awfully progressive about sucking spending power from an economy woefully short of demand. Then or now. *Europe isn\u2019t working, by Larry Elliott and Dan Atkinson, Yale University Press",

      "bodyText": "A college lecturer who took a photograph at a Lake District beauty spot sparked a major police investigation after the picture appeared to show a dead body floating in the water. Sarah Gallagher ended up feeling a \u201cbit of an idiot\u201d, however, after officers discovered during the search and rescue operation that what appeared to be a human arm in the photograph was actually a tree branch. With the onset of spring weather Gallagher took a trip to Tarn Hows, two miles north of Coniston, last weekend. She was intrigued when a passing dog walker mentioned seeing an otter and she took a number of snaps of the tarn hoping she might manage to photograph the elusive animal. The 45-year-old then returned to her home in Skipton, North Yorkshire, and later that evening as she took a closer look at the pictures to see if she had succeeded in capturing a shot of the otter she was shocked to see what appeared to show a grisly image of a floating body. \u201cI sat down and got my camera out, zooming in to try and see the otter and then I saw this \u2018thing\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first thing I thought was \u2018oh my goodness that\u2019s somebody\u2019s arm. It belongs to a person, it\u2019s a human arm\u2019.\u201d She realised she had no choice but to report her discovery, and police officers in South Cumbria agreed \u2013 there appeared to be a human arm in the shot. A search and rescue operation was launched involving police and volunteers from Coniston mountain rescue team, and it continued for two days until officers discovered that the human body was in fact a tree. \u201cI was hoping it wasn\u2019t going to be a body, but in the back of my mind I thought there are so many people who go missing, maybe this could help a relative\u2019s family who are looking for answers,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cBut then the police called me back and said they\u2019d found what was in the picture, it was part of a tree.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn faced further calls for a tougher crackdown on antisemitism within Labour on Sunday after one of his allies dismissed the crisis as a \u201csmear\u201d against the party and its members. Diane Abbott, the shadow international development secretary, dismissed claims that the party had a problem with antisemitism, provoking fresh criticism of the Labour leadership. She suggested the problem was procedural and instead lay within Labour\u2019s rules governing antisemitic and other racist comments, which she said would be corrected following a review of the party\u2019s guidelines. \u201cEvery single claim of antisemitism \u2013 I think 12 \u2013 has resulted in a suspension. Ken was suspended within hours. That is 12 allegations when 200,000 [new members] have joined the party,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cIt\u2019s a smear to say that Labour has a problem with antisemitism. It is something like a smear against ordinary party members.\u201d Her comments, made on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show on Sunday morning, was followed by more criticism of the leadership\u2019s response to repeated claims of antisemitism by Labour MPs and one major party donor. On Friday, Corbyn suspended Ken Livingstone from the party and announced an independent inquiry into antisemitism in Labour, to be led by Shami Chakrabarti, the former head of Liberty. It follows incendiary comments by the former London mayor that appeared to claim that Adolf Hitler, whose regime was responsible for the deaths of six million Jews, supported Zionism. Livingstone has refused to apologise to the Jewish community for the comments. He said this weekend the row was not about antisemitism but rather a plot by \u201cembittered old Blairite MPs\u201d to destabilise Corbyn\u2019s leadership. In a heated exchange over the party\u2019s response to the comments, Marr challenged Abbott to explain why, if Labour had no broader problem with antisemitism, the leader had announced an inquiry into the issue. The shadow minister implied that the problem was with the rules of the party: \u201cThere are issues about process. There is nothing in the rules about racism, antisemitism and Islamophobia. We are going to make the rules explicit.\u201d Corbyn later reaffirmed his pledge to rid the party of all forms of racism. Speaking at a May Day rally in London, the Labour leader said the party \u201cstands absolutely against racism in any form\u201d. He said: \u201cWe stand united as a Labour movement recognising our faith diversity, our ethnic diversity, and from that diversity comes up strength.\u201d However, Labour donor Michael Foster, who gave the party \u00a3400,000 before the general election in which he stood as a candidate, said some members of the party\u2019s leadership continued to \u201cvilify Jews as part of their political shtick\u201d. He called for the Chakrabarti inquiry to be widened, and said on BBC Radio 4\u2019s The World this Weekend he would not donate to the party nationally because of the leadership\u2019s approach. Meanwhile, many others within the parliamentary party remained dismayed at the response from Abbott following contrite comments by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, on Saturday. Ben Bradshaw, the former culture minister, said Labour members were furious at how allegations of antisemitism had been handled. \u201cI\u2019m increasingly of the view that Ken Livingstone is a Conservative party spy who\u2019s been planted in the Labour party and has been sleeping and has now emerged to try to do as much damage as he possibly can. \u201cAnd that\u2019s certainly the view of my loyal Labour party members and activists and voters who came up to me all day yesterday saying: what is going on? They were outraged by his comments. If he comes back into the party, they won\u2019t vote for our party. It\u2019s a really serious issue,\u201d he said. Louise Ellman, the Jewish MP for Liverpool Riverside, said the response had been \u201cmuch too slow\u201d. The party is investigating a complaint that she has been subject to antisemitic abuse at a meeting of the local party. Len McCluskey, the head of Unite, Britain\u2019s biggest union and the party\u2019s biggest donor, criticised Livingstone and backed his suspension. However, he told Pienaar\u2019s Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cThis is nothing more than a cynical attempt to manipulate antisemitism for political ends because it is all about constantly challenging Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. \u201cThe idea that there is an antisemitic crisis within the Labour party is absolutely offensive but it is being used in order to challenge Jeremy Corbyn. Once the mood music of antisemitism dies down, then next week and the week after there will be another subject. It is an issue that comes up because somebody says something stupid and then immediately it becomes a crisis.\u201d Corbyn announced an independent review last week and pledged to tighten party codes of conduct in an attempt to control the row over antisemitism, which has seen the MP Naz Shah as well as Livingstone suspended by the party. He has faced calls from Israeli politicians and diplomats to give a more \u201cunequivocal\u201d condemnation, and warnings \u2013 including from the party\u2019s London mayoral candidate, Sadiq Khan \u2013 that Labour would be punished in the 5 May elections. Mark Regev, Israel\u2019s ambassador to London, called for Corbyn to distance himself from Hamas, which he described as an antisemitic organisation. \u201cThe left has a wonderful, proud history of fighting antisemitism, but we have seen some language over the last two or three weeks which is very concerning,\u201d Regev said. \u201cThey have the right to criticise the Israeli government, Israeli citizens do it every day,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is about demonising the Jewish state. It is not about criticising this or that Israeli policy; it is about the demonising and vilification of my country and its very right to exist. \u201cIt is important that the leadership is not neutral or agnostic about antisemitism. I\u2019ll give you an example; you have had too many people of the progressive side of politics who have embraced Hamas and Hezbollah. Both of them are antisemitic organisations. You just have to read their charters which read like The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. \u201cIf you are progressive, you are embracing an organisation which is homophobic, which is misogynistic and which is openly antisemitic \u2013 what is progressive about that? There needs to be an unequivocal message from the leadership saying there is no solidarity with antisemites.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "On Thursday I was on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Inside Science, discussing with Adam Rutherford some excitement around the new data from CERN\u2019s Large Hadron Collider. Under his newly-invented \u2018Cloak of Speculation\u2019, we mused as to whether the currently statistically-marginal blip might develop into the first evidence for a new particle, perhaps some kinds of heavier version of the Higgs boson, or maybe even some kind of graviton looped over higher dimensions of spacetime. You can listen to us here. I had thought the Cloak of Speculation would provide enough cover to maintain scientific respectability, and avoid drawing the ire of my superiors in the mysterious order that runs the LHC (and indeed everything else). But it seems I went too far, and not twelve hours later, a recently developed technology was deployed to prevent the speculation taking off. The \u2018dead cat\u2019 manoeuvre is by now well established. Attributed to the Australian politico Lynton Crosby it is a method of moving the discussion off a topic which one would rather not have discussed. Boris \u2018American ancestry\u2019 Johnson, a serial beneficiary, sums it up thus: There is one thing that is absolutely certain about throwing a dead cat on the dining room table \u2013 and I don\u2019t mean that people will be outraged, alarmed, disgusted. That is true, but irrelevant. The key point, says my Australian friend, is that everyone will shout, \u2018Jeez, mate, there\u2019s a dead cat on the table!\u2019 In other words, they will be talking about the dead cat \u2013 the thing you want them to talk about \u2013 and they will not be talking about the issue that has been causing you so much grief. The method works extremely well and, and is claimed as a major factor in the surprise election win for the Conservatives in the UK general election of 2015. However, there are risks, alluded to in the Johnson quote above. Eventually, someone is going to ask \u2018Who threw the dead cat?\u2019 In the short term this is irrelevant, but in the longer term it could be damaging, especially now that Johnson, with his typical respect for the intelligence of voters, has blown Crosby\u2019s secret. Thus the all-powerful, secretive conspiracy-that-runs-everything-to-some-mysterious-plan (insert your prejudice here as to its identity, but of course you will be wrong, because it is all-powerful and secretive) has been developing the \u2018self-throwing dead cat\u2019. The conspirators have deployed it twice this week. Of course it is a metaphor, and the fact that in one case it was a fouine (colloquially translated as \u2018weasel\u2019, though beech marten is more accurate), which diverted attention from any graviton speculation at the LHC, should not be a surprise. The other deployment of course was an ex-Mayor of London. Trained in the same school as the weasel, Ken Livingstone expertly invoked a version of Godwin\u2019s law then hid in a disabled toilet. As intended, the particularly odious stink he caused totally derailed all political discussion in the UK. This is especially impressive given the current National Health Service crisis and the fact that local government and parental representation are being removed from all schools, all while the governing party tears itself to pieces over the tricky debate as to whether the UK should retain its leading role in the EU, or return to the welcoming arms of its grateful Imperial colonies. The immense success of both gambits will be a huge relief. Rumours persist that both Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are earlier prototypes of the \u2018self-throwing dead cat\u2019, deployed by the Republican establishment in the USA, which got disastrously out of control. There is no sign that either the weasel or the ex-Mayor will go on to world domination. Though perhaps we should not be complacent. Jon Butterworth\u2019s book Smashing Physics is available as \u201cMost Wanted Particle\u201d in Canada &amp; the US and was shortlisted for the Royal Society Winton Prize for Science Books.",

      "body": "<p>On Thursday I was on BBC Radio 4\u2019s <em>Inside Science</em>, discussing with Adam Rutherford some excitement around the new data from CERN\u2019s Large Hadron Collider. Under his newly-invented \u2018Cloak of Speculation\u2019, we mused as to whether the currently statistically-marginal blip might develop into the first evidence for a new particle, perhaps some kinds of heavier version of the Higgs boson, or maybe even some kind of graviton looped over higher dimensions of spacetime. You can listen to us <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0783ln4\">here</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Eventually, someone is going to ask \u2018Who threw the dead cat?\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I had thought the Cloak of Speculation would provide enough cover to maintain scientific respectability, and avoid drawing the ire of my superiors in the mysterious order that runs the LHC (and indeed everything else). But it seems I went too far, and not twelve hours later, a recently developed technology was deployed to prevent the speculation taking off.</p> <p>The \u2018dead cat\u2019 manoeuvre is by now well established. Attributed to the Australian politico <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/20/lynton-crosby-and-dead-cat-won-election-conservatives-labour-intellectually-lazy\">Lynton Crosby</a> it is a method of moving the discussion off a topic which one would rather not have discussed. <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/boris-Johnson-renounces-us-citizenship-tax-bill-mayor-london/385554/\">Boris \u2018American ancestry\u2019 Johnson</a>, a serial beneficiary, sums it up thus:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is one thing that is absolutely certain about throwing a dead cat on the dining room table \u2013 and I don\u2019t mean that people will be outraged, alarmed, disgusted. That is true, but irrelevant. The key point, says my Australian friend, is that everyone will shout, \u2018Jeez, mate, there\u2019s a dead cat on the table!\u2019 In other words, they will be talking about the dead cat \u2013 the thing you want them to talk about \u2013 and they will not be talking about the issue that has been causing you so much grief.</p> </blockquote> <p>The method works extremely well and, and is claimed as a major factor in the surprise election win for the Conservatives in the UK general election of 2015. </p> <p>However, there are risks, alluded to in the Johnson quote above. Eventually, someone is going to ask \u2018Who threw the dead cat?\u2019 In the short term this is irrelevant, but in the longer term it could be damaging, especially now that Johnson, with his typical respect for the intelligence of voters, has blown Crosby\u2019s secret.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/29/large-hadron-collider-fouine-chews-through-transformer-wiring\">Large Hadron Collider on paws after creature chews through wiring</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thus the all-powerful, secretive conspiracy-that-runs-everything-to-some-mysterious-plan (insert your prejudice here as to its identity, but of course you will be wrong, because it is all-powerful and secretive) has been developing the \u2018self-throwing dead cat\u2019. The conspirators have deployed it twice this week. Of course it is a metaphor, and the fact that in one case it was a fouine (colloquially translated as \u2018weasel\u2019, though beech marten is more accurate), which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/29/large-hadron-collider-fouine-chews-through-transformer-wiring\">diverted attention</a> from any graviton speculation at the LHC, should not be a surprise. The other deployment of course was an ex-Mayor of London.</p> <p>Trained in the same school as the weasel, Ken Livingstone expertly invoked a version of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin&apos;s_law\">Godwin\u2019s law</a> then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/apr/28/labour-has-serious-problem-with-antisemitism-peers-claim-politics-live\">hid in a disabled toilet</a>. As intended, the particularly odious stink he caused totally derailed all political discussion in the UK. This is especially impressive given the current <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/30/nhs-worse-services-three-quarters-britons-expect-survey\">National Health Service crisis</a> and the fact that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/26/academy-schools-plan-cross-party-opposition-councillors-anger\">local government and parental representation are being removed from all schools</a>, all while the governing party tears itself to pieces over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">tricky debate</a> as to whether the UK should retain its leading role in the EU, or return to the welcoming arms of its grateful Imperial colonies. </p> <p>The immense success of both gambits will be a huge relief. Rumours persist that both Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are earlier prototypes of the \u2018self-throwing dead cat\u2019, deployed by the Republican establishment in the USA, which got disastrously out of control. There is no sign that either the weasel or the ex-Mayor will go on to world domination. </p> <p>Though perhaps we should not be complacent.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonmbutterworth\">Jon Butterworth</a>\u2019s book </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/02/smashing-physics-jon-butterworth-review-cern-higgs-boson-particle\"><em>Smashing Physics</em></a><em> </em><em>is available as \u201cMost Wanted Particle</em>\u201d<em> in Canada &amp; the US and was shortlisted for the <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/book-prizes/winton-book-prize/\">Royal Society Winton Prize for Science Books</a>.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cOh gosh, someone\u2019s had an accident there,\u201d says actor Naomie Harris, sounding concerned. She\u2019s in a car en route to the Dior show at Paris fashion week; such invitations have tumbled in since she played Winnie Mandela in 2013\u2019s Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom and updated Eve Moneypenny in the Bond films Skyfall and Spectre. Harris, 39, began acting professionally aged nine, and after university (Cambridge) and drama school (Bristol Old Vic) she was cast by Danny Boyle in the dystopian 28 Days Later. Her new movie is Our Kind of Traitor, an adaptation of the John le Carr\u00e9 novel, in which she and Ewan McGregor are an ordinary couple caught up with the Russian mafia while on holiday in Marrakech. Is going to fashion shows fun or professional obligation? I love fashion and I have a great stylist who introduced me to it, because I didn\u2019t know anything about fashion before. Now we go every year to these shows and it\u2019s just a fun thing to do. But it\u2019s just for the red carpet, not everyday&nbsp;life. With Our Kind of Traitor \u2013 and the BBC\u2019s recent The Night Manager \u2013 are we seeing Le Carr\u00e9 being adapted in more opulent, glamorous style? I\u2019d say Our Kind of Traitor has got the real Le Carr\u00e9 feel to it, but maybe a difference would be the emphasis on the romantic relationship. It\u2019s a spy thriller and all of that, but at the heart of it, it\u2019s about love and family and you don\u2019t generally see that at the centre of Le Carr\u00e9 films. It used to be that Le Carr\u00e9 heroes were the cynical, anti-James Bonds. As someone who has worked on film versions of both, do you think they are coming closer&nbsp;together? If anything, Bond is moving closer to Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s world in that, with Daniel [Craig] playing Bond, it\u2019s become much grittier and less fantastical. So yeah, there\u2019s some movement but they are still fundamentally going to be very&nbsp;different. With two regular people at the centre of Our Kind of Traitor, it encourages the audience to think what we might do if, say, a kingpin money launderer for the Russian mafia asked for our help. How did you answer that personally? Oh, I\u2019d react incredibly badly. I\u2019m such a scaredy-cat, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be going on any of those adventures. I\u2019d be like my character, Gail, not wanting to go. That she goes along with it is solely because of her depth of love for Perry [McGregor] \u2013 and I don\u2019t think I would be brave enough to do that for anyone. Our Kind of Traitor is directed by Susanna White, who made Generation Kill, Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang and the BBC\u2019s Jane Eyre. Is it a different experience being directed by a woman in an action film like this one? It\u2019s not really a different experience \u2013 as in, if you have a great director then they have great sensitivity and understand how to speak to you to get you into a specific emotional state. The difference in having a female director \u2013 and also Gail Egan as a producer \u2013 is just a sense of reassurance on set. So often when you\u2019re on a film set, you do feel isolated, because you\u2019re often the only woman. I\u2019m so used to it that I just accept it, but there\u2019s some part of it that\u2019s alienating, and when you have an experience like working with Susanna and Gail, it makes you feel much more part of the process than you normally do. You feel like you belong a lot more. You famously asked for press material to refer to \u201cBond woman\u201d not \u201cBond girl\u201d \u2013 do you specifically seek out strong female&nbsp;roles? I\u2019m not interested in playing roles that stereotype me as a woman or as a black woman. I grew up with incredibly strong, powerful women around me who were highly intelligent and doing their own thing, and those are the women I\u2019m interested in portraying because that\u2019s what I know to be the truth. A woman who waits around for a man, pines after them\u2026 I don\u2019t have any experience of that kind of woman, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be very good at playing that kind of character. You landed the Moneypenny part after Sam Mendes saw you on stage in Danny Boyle\u2019s Frankenstein. But is it true that you don\u2019t find theatre acting wholly&nbsp;enjoyable? I\u2019m not a theatre animal. It\u2019s not my thing at all. I went to the Bristol Old Vic theatre school, so I\u2019ve trained to be a theatre actor, but in every performance&nbsp;I felt like I was going to throw up. I don\u2019t think that level of nerves is particularly healthy. I suppose the challenge is to channel those nerves into energy, excitement and things that help your performance, but I didn\u2019t manage to find a way to do&nbsp;that. You played the role for a few months \u2013 it didn\u2019t get better? It didn\u2019t get easier at all; every night was the same. Like Groundhog Day. Arrgh! Can you do anything to overcome nerves? I do something called EFT, which is emotional freedom technique, otherwise known as tapping, which really helps me. Is that where you use your fingers to stimulate acupuncture points? Yes, so I\u2019ll do that before a first day of filming. And if there\u2019s a particularly tricky scene I\u2019m worried about, I\u2019ll do it before then as well. Will anything positive come out of the #OscarsSoWhite debate about the Academy Awards\u2019 lack of diversity? I hope it does, because I wanted the debate to be more focused on solutions rather than venting about where we\u2019re at. The stats speak for themselves \u2013 the Oscars voters are 94% white, 76% male \u2013 so it just seems right, fair and inevitable that there should be some kind of change in the voting system. But if you just say, \u201cThis is unfair, we\u2019re going to boycott it,\u201d it doesn\u2019t force people into action. However, if you show the injustice of the system and say, \u201cLook, here\u2019s a way forward\u201d, it makes it more difficult for people to&nbsp;ignore. Idris Elba, your co-star in Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, complained recently that there\u2019s no British equivalent of the American Dream, and that\u2019s why he left to find more interesting work in the US. Would you agree with that? I understand what he\u2019s talking about with the American Dream: the notion that you can achieve anything. And I love the can-do mentality, in LA especially, the hunger. But there are negative sides to that as well, because I don\u2019t think this insatiable appetite for success at all costs is particularly healthy or balanced. And I think there\u2019s a fallacy in the dream, in that success doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to happiness. The things that you want aren\u2019t necessarily the things that are best for you. So I agree with him in some ways and in some ways not. As someone who was raised in a single-parent household in Finsbury Park, London, and went to state schools, are you surprised by the middle-class dominance of acting? It doesn\u2019t surprise me in the sense that it\u2019s an expensive profession to enter if you want to train, because now there aren\u2019t really the grants. So everybody has got to raise their own money to get to drama school, which is a huge hurdle if you don\u2019t have parents who have got money. And if you don\u2019t have any financial support and back-up it\u2019s a very scary profession, because there are always these huge intervals when you\u2019re not earning. That\u2019s just the nature of the business. Has that been difficult for you personally? I was very lucky because I started earning at nine and I saved all my income so that when I turned 18 and needed to go to university, it was all there. I always had a really strong work ethic. I didn\u2019t need to rely on anybody else financially and I couldn\u2019t anyway \u2013 that was never really an option \u2013 but I had a strong belief in myself that I could do it on my own. And that\u2019s what got me through. You wrote a novel aged 13 \u2013 what was the&nbsp;plot? It was about a middle-class girl whose parents get taken ill and she has to go and live on a council estate with her aunt. It was about the escapades she gets into and the culture shock, being from a very middle-class background and ending up on a council estate. Have you reread it recently? How does it hold up? I did reread it about two or three years ago and I was really impressed! It\u2019s so dated, because I talk about cassette players and Walkmans, so if I ever try to rewrite it and bring it up to date, it would need quite a bit of work. But I was like, \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d Then of course I shoved it back in a drawer. Is it true that you\u2019ve never drunk alcohol? Well, I\u2019ve had a sip of wine and I do love Bailey\u2019s at Christmas. The most girly drink possible. But other than that, no. I hate the taste and smell of it. What\u2019s the most useful and useless skill that you\u2019ve had to learn for a movie? Most useful: the physical training I had to do for Skyfall because it really kicked my butt and got me in shape. I\u2019m usually quite lazy about things like that but it\u2019s given me a lifelong healthy habit. The most useless was probably learning to scuba dive [for After the Sunset], because I absolutely hated it. I won\u2019t be doing that again in a hurry. Our Kind of Traitor is out 13 May",

I suppose the challenge is to channel those nerves into energy, excitement and things that help your performance, but I didn\u2019t manage to find a way to do\u00a0that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fe795476034fe35153017f7539527d2a1e50b59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fe795476034fe35153017f7539527d2a1e50b59/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harris alongside Idris Elba in Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harris alongside Idris Elba in Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pathe/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You played the role for a few months \u2013 it didn\u2019t get better?</strong><br />It didn\u2019t get easier at all; every night was the same.

The stats speak for themselves \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/03/oscar-voters-94-white-76-men-and-an-average-of-63-years-old/284163/\" title=\"\">Oscars voters are 94% white, 76% male</a> \u2013 so it just seems right, fair and inevitable that there should be some kind of change in the voting system. But if you just say, \u201cThis is unfair, we\u2019re going to boycott it,\u201d it doesn\u2019t force people into action. However, if you show the injustice of the system and say, \u201cLook, here\u2019s a way forward\u201d, it makes it more difficult for people to\u00a0ignore.</p> <p><strong>Idris Elba, your co-star in <em>Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom</em>, complained recently that there\u2019s no British equivalent of the American Dream, and that\u2019s why he left to find more interesting work in the US. Would you agree with that?</strong><br />I understand what he\u2019s talking about with the American Dream: the notion that you can achieve anything. And I love the can-do mentality, in LA especially, the hunger. But there are negative sides to that as well, because I don\u2019t think this insatiable appetite for success at all costs is particularly healthy or balanced. And I think there\u2019s a fallacy in the dream, in that success doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to happiness. The things that you want aren\u2019t necessarily the things that are best for you. So I agree with him in some ways and in some ways not.</p> <p><strong>As someone who was raised in a single-parent household in Finsbury Park, London, and went to state schools, are you surprised by the middle-class dominance of acting?</strong><br />It doesn\u2019t surprise me in the sense that it\u2019s an expensive profession to enter if you want to train, because now there aren\u2019t really the grants. So everybody has got to raise their own money to get to drama school, which is a huge hurdle if you don\u2019t have parents who have got money. And if you don\u2019t have any financial support and back-up it\u2019s a very scary profession, because there are always these huge intervals when you\u2019re not earning. That\u2019s just the nature of the business.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a43432cd69efcf37b4928267c2c5f5db451f9079\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a43432cd69efcf37b4928267c2c5f5db451f9079/0_0_4852_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harris and Jonny Lee Miller in Danny Boyle\u2019s Frankenstein at the National Theatre in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harris with Jonny Lee Miller in Danny Boyle\u2019s Frankenstein at the National Theatre in 2011: \u2018In every performance I felt like I was going to throw up.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Has that been difficult for you personally?</strong><br />I was very lucky because I started earning at nine and I saved all my income so that when I turned 18 and needed to go to university, it was all there.

I didn\u2019t need to rely on anybody else financially and I couldn\u2019t anyway \u2013 that was never really an option \u2013 but I had a strong belief in myself that I could do it on my own.

      "bodyText": "Alison Brackenbury\u2019s poetry is hospitable: open to all. She was born in 1953, the daughter of a Lincolnshire farmer. This is her ninth collection and could not have been written by a novice poet. It is modest, robust, humorous \u2013 often touching \u2013 and filled with accumulated wisdom. She is an unfashionable rhymer and it is a particular treat to encounter the musicality and seasoned craft in the best of her rhymes. Half-Fledged begins with a description of clumsily trying to embroider \u201chalf a daisy\u201d before giving up and, in the second stanza, sighting a baby greenfinch in the lane outside: \u201cFor half a mile, it bobs below the showers, / flits to a tree; embroiders elderflowers.\u201d What is pleasing is the stitching together of&nbsp;the&nbsp;first and second verses with the&nbsp;verb \u201cembroiders\u201d. \u201cElderflowers\u201d then strikes a unifying chord. In her moving poem January 7th, she writes about receiving a letter from a former lover, after 30 years of silence. It is one of several poems about returning and at the same time being unable to return. It has an unfussy feel and is told with everyday composure. Here the rhymes are simple \u2013 more invisible mending than&nbsp;flamboyant stitching. Every detail has been strictly considered, including the decisive punctuation: \u201calthough I cannot see you / and will not again.\u201d The full stop comes earlier than expected \u2013 a full stop that, movingly, means just that. Inevitably, her rhymes are not all equally successful. Friday Afternoon opens: \u201cIt was the autumn\u2019s last day, when the roof / was skimmed by wings \u2013 Red Admiral butterfly? \u2013 / a glance of black against the sky, like truth.\u201d The roof/truth is an uncomfortable half-rhyme and it is not the only problem \u2013 the idea of truth as a black glance is not&nbsp;developed enough to convince. The collection is intermittently haunted by Brackenbury\u2019s forebears and the wars they survived. She mentions selling poppies for Remembrance Sunday and some of her poems could be likened to poetic poppies, badges of honour. There is a fine poem, The Horse\u2019s Mouth, based&nbsp;on \u201cElizabeth Butler\u2019s painting&nbsp;of one survivor of the massacre of 16,000 British soldiers and&nbsp;camp followers in the first Afghan&nbsp;war, 1842\u201d. It tells a story vividly, with a&nbsp;firm eye on&nbsp;the horse as well as the&nbsp;unfortunate riders, and concludes with gruff humour and poignancy: \u201cHow, in such heat, / can Queen or country beat retreat? / Ask Generals. Ask recruits\u2019 torn feet. / Now ask the horse.\u201d Throughout, one senses her interest in poetic community and in songs of the past (Shanties, an excellent poem, is one of several examples of this). She celebrates poets as various as Michael Donaghy, Anna Adams and Sylvia Plath. But what I most enjoyed are the apparently less ambitious poems rooted (literally, in one case) in the ordinary present. Peelings is the most sympathetic poem about parsnips you are ever likely to read. It dramatises the way a repeated domestic action may remind you of a person (for me, it is peeling onions \u2013 everyone has their own version). Peeling parsnips recalls her octogenarian father and the conversational restraint between them, happily broken by his cheery confirmation that his parsnips are home-grown. I like best her more humble poems that celebrate humble things. She has the experience to know that subjects are often slight only on the surface. There is a diverting poem about the failings of Bramley apples. And the opening poem, Honeycomb, is a beauty in which she asks herself whether \u201cI&nbsp;live too long\u201d. But gloom is overthrown by the glorious taste of the honeycomb itself, an experience she comically aggrandises: \u201cIn my shabby room / I am a god.

    "webTitle": "Barack Obama in surprise swipe at Clinton at final correspondents' dinner", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barack Obama has taken satirical swipes at Donald Trump and, more surprisingly, Hillary Clinton and ended his final White House correspondents\u2019 dinner by literally dropping the mic and departing with the words: \u201cObama out.\u201d In the traditional tongue-in-cheek address to the Washington press corps on Saturday night, the president lampooned the Republican frontrunner\u2019s foreign policy and business credentials while also mercilessly mocking the efforts of his fellow Democrat to appeal to younger voters. Obama did not linger on Trump for as long as some had expected during his half-hour speech, especially those who recall the correspondents\u2019 dinner in 2011 where he roasted the celebrity tycoon as he sat in the room. Watched by an audience that included politicians, journalists, actors and Trump\u2019s two sons, he pretended to wind up his remarks before interrupting himself: \u201cNo, I\u2019m just kidding, you know I\u2019ve got to talk about Trump. We weren\u2019t just going to stop there. Come on! \u201cAlthough I am a little hurt that he\u2019s not here tonight. We had so much fun the last time. And it is surprising: you\u2019ve got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras, and he says no. Is this dinner too tacky for The Donald? What could he possibly be doing instead? Is he at home eating a Trump steak, tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel? What\u2019s he doing?\u201d Evidently relishing this election year, Obama then made reference to Trump\u2019s former ownership of the Miss Universe beauty pageant. \u201cThe Republican establishment is incredulous that he is the most likely nominee,\u201d he continued. \u201cIncredulous! Shocking! They say Donald lacks the foreign policy experience to be president but, in fairness, he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world. Miss Sweden. Miss Argentina. Miss Azerbaijan.\u201d As guests erupted in laughter, the candidate\u2019s claim to be a winner in business was also targeted. \u201cAnd there\u2019s one area where Donald\u2019s experience could be invaluable and that\u2019s closing Guantanamo because Trump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground.\u201d Obama said he had more material but would leave it there, prompting the crowd to beg for more. He went on to make a sardonic-but-serious point about the avalanche of media coverage devoted to Trump, who has warned that any attempt to deny him the Republican nomination at the party\u2019s convention in Cleveland, Ohio, in July could lead to violent protests. \u201cI don\u2019t want to spend too much time on The Donald,\u201d he said. \u201cFollowing your lead, I want to show some restraint because I think we can all agree that, from the start, he\u2019s gotten the appropriate amount of coverage, befitting the seriousness of his candidacy. I hope y\u2019all are proud of yourselves. The guy wanted to give his hotel business a boost and now we\u2019re praying that Cleveland makes it through July.\u201d At that, Obama shook his head slightly and grunted: \u201cMmm, mmm, mmm. Mmm.\u201d Trump\u2019s rival Ted Cruz received barbs for his recent reference to a \u201cbasketball ring\u201d while campaigning in Indiana. Obama, whose father was Kenyan, said: \u201cWhat else is in his lexicon? Baseball sticks? Football hats? But, sure, I\u2019m the foreign one.\u201d But Obama\u2019s fellow Democrats were not spared. When Obama hailed Sanders as \u201cthe bright new face of the Democratic party\u201d, the white-haired, 74-year-old leftwinger, wearing a lounge suit instead of a tuxedo, rose to acknowledge audience applause. The president said: \u201cI am hurt, though, Bernie, that you\u2019ve been distancing yourself a little from me. I mean, that\u2019s just not something that you do to your comrade.\u201d He then compared Sanders\u2019 slogan, \u201cFeel the Bern\u201d, to an imagined one for Clinton that flashed up on screens: \u201cTrudge up the Hill\u201d, with the image of an \u201cH\u201d pushing a rock up a slope. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to admit it though, Hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative who just signed up for Facebook. \u2018Dear America, did you get my poke? Is it appearing on your wall? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m using this right. Love, Aunt Hillary.\u2019 It\u2019s not entirely persuasive.\u201d Clinton was also on the receiving end when Obama began his remarks by apologising for being late. He explained: \u201cI was running on CPT, which stands for \u2018jokes that white people should not make\u2019\u201d \u2013 a reference to a recent sketch by New York mayor Bill de Blasio and Clinton in which she castigated him for endorsing her so late, and he claimed to have been \u201crunning on CP time\u201d (\u201ccoloured-people time\u201d). Obama went on: \u201cHere we are, my eighth and final appearance at this unique event and I am excited. If this material works well I\u2019m going to use it at Goldman Sachs next year. Earn me some serious Tubmans,\u201d \u2013 references to Clinton\u2019s lucrative speeches on Wall Street and the recent decision to put the founder of the Underground Railroad on the national currency. As in past years, Obama made himself the butt of some of jokes, reflecting on the imminent end of his presidency. \u201cI\u2019m grey, grizzled, just counting down the days to my death panel.\u201d He added: \u201cEven some foreign leaders have been looking ahead, anticipating my departure. Last week, Prince George showed up to our meeting in his bathrobe. That was a slap in the face. A clear breach of protocol.\u201d But he also noted: \u201cIn my final year, my approval ratings keep going up. The last time I was this high, I was trying to decide on my major.\u201d He said he and his aides were mystified as to the cause of his popularity, while the video feed cut to a pictures of Cruz and Trump. There was also a spoof video, \u201cCouch Commander\u201d, in which Obama and old foe John Boehner, former speaker of the House, united to consider life after leaving office. Obama made a glancing reference to TV series Game of Thrones, described British actor Helen Mirren as \u201cawesome\u201d and, in paying tribute to vice-president Joe Biden, took a backwards swipe at George W Bush\u2019s deputy Dick Cheney. \u201cI love Joe Biden, I really do. I want to thank him for his friendship, his counsel, for always giving it to me straight. For not shooting anybody in the face.\u201d The president\u2019s speech clearly tickled the audience in the Washington Hilton ballroom that included Biden, John Kerry, Republican party chairman Reince Priebus, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and actors Mirren, Jared Leto, Bryan Cranston, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo, and Tom Hiddleston. Turning serious at the end, the president thanked the White House correspondents and praised a free press. \u201cI just have two more words to say: Obama out.\u201d With that, he held out the mic and dropped it, just as basketball star Kobe Bryant had recently done at the end of his last game. Obama proved a hard act to follow. Comedian Larry Wilmore\u2019s routine had a more mixed reception, with gags about the media prompting groans but other lines hitting the mark. He ended on a poignant and unexpected note. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I lived in a country where people couldn\u2019t accept a black quarterback,\u201d Wilmore said. \u201cNow think about that. A black man was thought by his mere colour not good enough to lead a football team. And now to live in your time, Mr President, when a black man can lead the entire free world. Words alone do me no justice. So, Mr President, if I\u2019m going to keep it 100.\u201d Wilmore pounded his chest and said: \u201cYo, Barry, you did it, my nigga!\u201d The Washington Hilton ballroom was crowded with celebrities. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders joined vice president Joe Biden, secretary of state John Kerry and other government officials.",

Obama, whose father was Kenyan, said: \u201cWhat else is in his lexicon? Baseball sticks? Football hats? But, sure, I\u2019m the foreign one.\u201d</p> <p>But Obama\u2019s fellow Democrats were not spared. When Obama hailed Sanders as \u201cthe bright new face of the Democratic party\u201d, the white-haired, 74-year-old leftwinger, wearing a lounge suit instead of a tuxedo, rose to acknowledge audience applause. The president said: \u201cI am hurt, though, Bernie, that you\u2019ve been distancing yourself a little from me. I mean, that\u2019s just not something that you do to your comrade.\u201d</p> <p>He then compared Sanders\u2019 slogan, \u201cFeel the Bern\u201d, to an imagined one for Clinton that flashed up on screens: \u201cTrudge up the Hill\u201d, with the image of an \u201cH\u201d pushing a rock up a slope. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to admit it though, Hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative who just signed up for Facebook. \u2018Dear America, did you get my poke? Is it appearing on your wall? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m using this right. Love, Aunt Hillary.\u2019 It\u2019s not entirely persuasive.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton was also on the receiving end when Obama began his remarks by apologising for being late. He explained: \u201cI was running on CPT, which stands for \u2018jokes that white people should not make\u2019\u201d \u2013 a reference to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/apr/12/hillary-clinton-bill-de-blasio-cp-time-coloured-people-video\">a recent sketch by New York mayor Bill de Blasio</a> and Clinton in which she castigated him for endorsing her so late, and he claimed to have been \u201crunning on CP time\u201d (\u201ccoloured-people time\u201d).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cc4db30f63d9ab56535cc7a57b3504a24d8c7c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cc4db30f63d9ab56535cc7a57b3504a24d8c7c8/0_121_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Barack Obama applauds at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association annual dinner in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Barack Obama applauds at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association annual dinner in Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuri Gripas/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Obama went on: \u201cHere we are, my eighth and final appearance at this unique event and I am excited.

Last week, Prince George showed up to our meeting in his bathrobe. That was a slap in the face. A clear breach of protocol.\u201d</p> <p>But he also noted: \u201cIn my final year, my approval ratings keep going up. The last time I was this high, I was trying to decide on my major.\u201d He said he and his aides were mystified as to the cause of his popularity, while the video feed cut to a pictures of Cruz and Trump.</p> <p>There was also a spoof video, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/726603674181578752\">\u201cCouch Commander\u201d</a>, in which Obama and old foe John Boehner, former speaker of the House, united to consider life after leaving office.</p> <p>Obama made a glancing reference to TV series Game of Thrones, described British actor Helen Mirren as \u201cawesome\u201d and, in paying tribute to vice-president Joe Biden, took a backwards swipe at George W Bush\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/13/usa.dickcheney\">deputy Dick Cheney</a>. \u201cI love Joe Biden, I really do.

A black man was thought by his mere colour not good enough to lead a football team. And now to live in your time, Mr President, when a black man can lead the entire free world. Words alone do me no justice. So, Mr President, if I\u2019m going to keep it 100.\u201d</p> <p>Wilmore pounded his chest and said: \u201cYo, Barry, you did it, my nigga!\u201d</p> <p>The Washington Hilton ballroom was crowded with celebrities. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders joined vice president Joe Biden, secretary of state John Kerry and other government officials. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The new novel details the history of religion in Sweden. What made you want to tackle that subject now? I have nothing against religion but I always thought that the Bible was overrated. Many of the stories are terrible. I think we should look more critically at the Bible, which to me has very little to do with belief. According to the Bible, we\u2019re supposed to fear God. I don\u2019t buy that at all. I fear Isis. Fear to me is a bad word. Your novels have eccentric protagonists caught up in extraordinary events. How do you create your characters? I collect characters in real life: I read about them, I see real people on TV, I meet them and store them in my head. And then I go to the library in my head and I pick people and mix them up. For this book, I could have picked a driving instructor not knowing how to drive, or an economist not knowing how to count. Instead, I picked a priest not believing in God. Your books are often described as zany, comic, feelgood stories; is there a lack of literature that makes readers laugh? Yes. To me, it\u2019s strange that quality literature is supposed not to be funny or feelgood. I don\u2019t see the conflict. If we didn\u2019t deal with mankind with a glint in the eye, I don\u2019t think we could survive. Your debut novel, The Hundred-Year-Old Man\u2026, has been published in 45 countries and sold more than 10m copies. To what do you credit the book\u2019s success? You can\u2019t account for it by way of one single explanation. I sent it to the six biggest editorial houses in Sweden and the first five said thank you but no thank you. Only the sixth said yes. I think it\u2019s both skill and luck. Somehow I reach both non-readers and super-readers. A lot of literature spreads despair and desperation and tragedy. I think my success is that I spread hope. What do you think it is about The Hundred-Year-Old Man that struck such a chord with readers? I think each and every one of us should climb out of our own windows once or twice in our lives. I think those who are afraid of dying are those who have not lived enough. In my books you can climb out of the window in your fantasy. You\u2019ve said previously that The One-Hundred-Year-Old Man took you 47 years to write. What was the catalyst that helped you complete it in the end? I ran a media company with 107 employees and I was stupid enough to think that I was responsible for it all, including all the copier machines and everything. I was completely burnt out. I fell to pieces. So I ended up selling the company and moving to the Swiss-Italian border, finding myself without an identity. Suddenly I was an ex-person. I needed an identity. And I had 130 pages of A Hundred Year-Old-Man saved from years before. So has writing been your therapy? Somehow, Allan Karlsson [the protagonist in The One-Hundred-Year-Old Man] became less worried about everything the more I worried about everything. I wouldn\u2019t like to be like him because he\u2019s a political idiot but still, up to this day, he\u2019s sitting on my shoulder when I get worried telling me \u201cJust calm down\u201d. He\u2019s my therapist. The new novel sees your characters searching for \u201cthe meaning of it all\u201d. What is the meaning of it all for you? Our life\u2019s journey is the meaning of it all. If you travel enough \u2013 mentally and physically \u2013 you will die happy. Hitman Anders and the Meaning of It All is published by Fourth Estate (\u00a38.99).

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Born in Caen in north-western France, Gilles Peterson started his career as a club DJ in London specialising in acid jazz. He then presented shows on pirate stations such as Radio Invicta and on BBC Radio London, leaving in 1986 for a residency at Dingwalls in Camden. He has presented on a number of radio stations including Kiss FM, Radio 1 and Jazz FM, and now presents a three-hour Saturday afternoon show on BBC Radio 6 Music. Over the years he has hosted sessions with acts such as Bj\u00f6rk, Flying Lotus and Kamasi Washington. Peterson will be presenting a show at the Liverpool International Music Festival on 21 July called From the Soul, which explores soul music through the decades. 1 | Book Original Rockers by Richard King This is about Revolver Records, a record shop in Bristol that influenced most of the musical revolutions that happened in the city in the 1980s and 1990s. The post-punk groups, Massive Attack, Portishead \u2013 they all would\u2019ve gone through that shop. It was written by Richard King and it\u2019s his memories of working in the shop and the kind of characters who passed through it. My first job in the industry was working in a record shop in Hammersmith \u2013 I lasted two days. I soon realised I was better off making records than selling them. This book offers a great insight into the psychology of people who work in record shops. It needs to be turned into a film: it\u2019s like a Nick Hornby novel for the Pitchfork generation. 2 | Film Anomalisa A lot of people were indifferent to this film but I thought it was amazing. I just happened to be walking past and decided to go to the cinema, since I\u2019ve loved everything Charlie Kaufman has done, but I didn\u2019t realise it was going to be an animated film. I totally fell in love with it. I related to the main character, who is this travelling author \u2013 the way it captures the mundaneness of the hotels and the pick-ups from the airports. Not to say my life is mundane, but that side of it \u2013 the travel, having to go out for dinner with people when you don\u2019t necessarily want to \u2013 I thought they captured that brilliantly well. 3 | Gig Abdullah Ibrahim He\u2019s an 81-year-old musician from Cape Town and is regarded as the Mozart of South Africa. He was part of the free jazz movement of the 1960s and 1970s, and everything he does is pretty much improvised. I like jazz, especially jazz at the highest level, when the musician isn\u2019t thinking about what he\u2019s playing and it becomes part of him \u2013 that comes with time and age and practice. I went to see him at the Barbican a few months ago and he was an artist at the top of his game. I interviewed him afterwards and didn\u2019t understand half of what he was saying because he\u2019s on such a deep level. It was like talking to a professor. 4 | Venue The Pickle Factory London\u2019s got such a brilliant heritage in music and club culture, although nightclubs aren\u2019t often seen as important places. Plastic People closed last year, which caused a lot of sadness. But the Pickle Factory, opposite Oval Space in east London, is a beautiful little space for 200 people. It\u2019s a very simple, plain, rectangular room \u2013 the one thing it\u2019s lacking is a wooden dancefloor. If it had one it would be the new perfect club in London because it has exceptional sounds.

There are no other restaurants around it, you wouldn\u2019t expect it. Finding great restaurants outside the West End seems to be happening more and more: you can find great places to eat in areas of Peckham where five years ago there would\u2019ve been nothing. I always thought of Stoke Newington as lacking in good restaurants, but it\u2019s slowly beginning to change. This is a good example of that. For me, the moment to go is on a Friday afternoon because it\u2019s open at nights, but on Friday it\u2019s open all day. The menu is mainly British, with little touches of Italian and European \u2013 we seem to remember the ox cheeks were particularly good \u2013 and they focus on natural wines. It\u2019s a perfect place. 7 | Magazine Jocks &amp; Nerds It\u2019s good to find a magazine that isn\u2019t trying to be all about new, new, new and young, young, young. They seem to have found their late 30s/40s type of age group really well. It\u2019s aimed at the subculture thing. They do big stories, whether it\u2019s design or architecture, as well as music and art, and also a lot of fashion. It could be an interview with people like Andrew Weatherall or Don Letts, or articles on post-punk, or Coventry in the 1980s. They use really good photographers. They\u2019re great curators: they direct you in a way that you can be confident is going to be satisfying to you.",

The post-punk groups, Massive Attack, Portishead \u2013 they all would\u2019ve gone through that shop. It was written by Richard King and it\u2019s his memories of working in the shop and the kind of characters who passed through it. My first job in the industry was working in a record shop in Hammersmith \u2013 I lasted two days. I soon realised I was better off making records than selling them. This book offers a great insight into the psychology of people who work in record shops.

I totally fell in love with it. I related to the main character, who is this travelling author \u2013 the way it captures the mundaneness of the hotels and the pick-ups from the airports.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Culpeper is the gift that keeps on giving: on its ground floor, a pub; a restaurant on the first; skyline views from its reopening-for-the-summer rooftop terrace; and now, on the second floor, five en suite bedrooms at \u00a3120 a night B&amp;B. It is an endeavour where succeeding at every level could be tricky, but team Culpeper manages it all with panache. It is late afternoon when I check in and the bar is already full, causing drinkers \u2013 a mix of London\u2019s young and zestful, City workers and craft-ale fans \u2013 to mill around the doors of the pub at the corner of Commercial Street and Wentworth Street. The atmosphere is genial-busy, even the sun is making an appearance, but the hubbub makes me wonder if the only way I\u2019ll be able to avoid getting annoyed by drinkers\u2019 late-night conversations is by joining them. Two floors up and inside Room Two, looking on to Commercial Street, I realise Monsieur Grump can take the night off. It is quiet but, more than that, it is quite lovely. The distressed aesthetic of the light-blue- and-sandstone walls is softened by Scandi elements such as a slatted wooden light shade, wooden clothes rail, a beautifully patterned throw from Mandal Veveri and striking prints by Rebecca Salvadori. It offers cosiness, character and, as I\u2019ll find later, the sleep-inducing comfort of a quality Hypnos bed, too. Other accoutrements include a Nespresso tea-and-coffee maker, wire-frame chair and reading matter, such as a map of the area designed by Herb Lester. However, just like the bijou bathroom (powerful shower, no bath), these elements suggest the Culpeper\u2019s rooms aren\u2019t designed for long-term lounging. And I can\u2019t argue with that when east London\u2019s adult playground is just a few minutes away. Brick Lane, the Old Truman Brewery, and Petticoat Lane and Spitalfields markets can all be reached before you\u2019ve switched on Google Maps. But, while the Culpeper may not want you hiding in your bedroom, it is more than happy to have you at its bar and restaurant, where hotel guests receive a 10% discount during their stay. Though tithed to Enterprise Inns, it offers a good choice of bottled and draught beers, the latter from Purity Brewing including the smooth Mad Goose, the fruity LongHorn IPA and the citrusy Pure Gold. I enjoy a pint of this last ale before meeting my dining companion and climbing the stairs to the restaurant. The evolution of the Culpeper \u2013 which is named after 17th-century herbalist Nicholas Culpeper \u2013 has been a phased one. When Jay Rayner raved about the food in July 2014 it was before the restaurant ascended to the first floor: that happened last year. Two years on and the food remains as successful and satisfying: inventive yet fuss-free modern British that is designed to comfort without resorting to crockery-bending quantity. My starter of crispy lamb breast, baby artichokes and salsa verde (\u00a36.50) is potent meaty terrain but with a textural counterpoint provided by vegetables, while my friend enjoys the delicate taste of asparagus, house-cured bacon and poached duck egg (\u00a38). The three mains on offer cover meat, fish and vegetarian options: we step either side of the red mullet (\u00a316) and pick gnocchi, shitake mushrooms, wild garlic, parmesan and pine nuts (\u00a312) and pork chop, baby garlic, broad beans, anchovy and herb crunch (\u00a316). Though the flavours are different, the result is the same: sweet and savoury in the right measure, punch where required, and satisfaction guaranteed. And so to bed \u2026 or rather up an extra flight of stairs to the rooftop, where many of the restaurant\u2019s vegetables and herbs are grown. This area is still being worked on but, ultimately, it will be a rooftop space where guests will take breakfast (I can tell you the fry-up rates highly, too). I stand and look at the night skyline, the Gherkin seeming so close, and picture this space busy with a grill pumping out food and a bar serving its cans of Purity\u2019s Lawless. I\u2019m sure it will be entertaining but, for a few seconds, it\u2019s wonderful to experience London in a moment of calm, with only a few street sounds filtering up to the heights. While it has several floors, the Culpeper doesn\u2019t have too many flaws. It certainly deserves its reputation for quality and \u2013 in a city where so many rooms are expensive but lack character \u2013 value for money. \u2022 Accommodation was provided by The Culpeper, 40 Commercial Street E1, doubles \u00a3120 B&amp;B, 020-7247 5371, theculpeper.com Ask a local The Gentle Author, writer and blogger at spitalfieldslife.com \u2022 Shopping No one can really say they have been to Spitalfields until they\u2019ve visited Gardners\u2019 Market Sundriesmen on Commercial Street and shaken the hand of Paul Gardner, the charismatic fourth-generation proprietor at London\u2019s oldest paper bag shop. \u2022 Drink Landlady Sandra Esqulant reigns supreme at The Golden Heart, but I also recommend cocktails at The Society Club, an outpost of the Soho institution.The basement of the magnificent 18th-century Townhouse is a snug place for a cuppa, with cakes baked to historic recipes. \u2022 Food The ever-changing menu of seasonal delights at St John Bread &amp; Wine never disappoints. \u2022 Culture Experience the smells, sounds and darkness of old London by candlelight at Dennis Severs\u2019 House, then visit the futuristic Libreria bookshop for contemporary Spitalfields at its most urbane.",

I enjoy a pint of this last ale before meeting my dining companion and climbing the stairs to the restaurant.</p> <p>The evolution of the Culpeper \u2013 which is named after 17th-century herbalist Nicholas Culpeper \u2013 has been a phased one. When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/20/the-culpeper-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\">Jay Rayner raved about the food in July 2014</a> it was before the restaurant ascended to the first floor: that happened last year. Two years on and the food remains as successful and satisfying: inventive yet fuss-free modern British that is designed to comfort without resorting to crockery-bending quantity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"08ac864bc201a34d30de71997db44b301c2c6b3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08ac864bc201a34d30de71997db44b301c2c6b3f/0_43_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The pub, on the ground floor of the Culpeper in east London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pub, on the ground floor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Dorrin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My starter of crispy lamb breast, baby artichokes and salsa verde (\u00a36.50) is potent meaty terrain but with a textural counterpoint provided by vegetables, while my friend enjoys the delicate taste of asparagus, house-cured bacon and poached duck egg (\u00a38). The three mains on offer cover meat, fish and vegetarian options: we step either side of the red mullet (\u00a316) and pick gnocchi, shitake mushrooms, wild garlic, parmesan and pine nuts (\u00a312) and pork chop, baby garlic, broad beans, anchovy and herb crunch (\u00a316). Though the flavours are different, the result is the same: sweet and savoury in the right measure, punch where required, and satisfaction guaranteed.</p> <p>And so to bed \u2026 or rather up an extra flight of stairs to the rooftop, where many of the restaurant\u2019s vegetables and herbs are grown.

      "bodyText": "Last weekend I found myself trapped on an isolated, monster-infested Pacific atoll with a pair of twin psychic&nbsp;Japanese schoolgirls. A skyscraper-sized lizard, with three fire-breathing heads, the result of careless radioactive experiments in the 50s, and now a huge clumsy metaphor for both the dangers of human scientific meddling with Mother Nature and postwar Japanese&nbsp;identity anxiety, had cornered us in a cave on the beach. My new friends Lora and Moll hoped to summon to our aid a gigantic&nbsp;moth, with roughly the dimensions of an airship, over which they exercised a strange interspecies erotic sway. Anticipating this titanic struggle of equally matched opponents, each driven by blind instinct and insensible to reason, my thoughts naturally turned to June\u2019s forthcoming Brexit vote. Arguments about Brexit are tearing&nbsp;my family apart. In March, drunk in the late dark, and loose on the internet, I had ordered a European&nbsp;flag from Amazon, intending to fly it from the roof come the week of the Eurovote so as to annoy any divs living locally. But I forgot about the flag and left it on the sofa and now the cat has taken to sleeping under it. Which is odd, as previously he was an avowed Eurosceptic, and would hiss aggressively whenever I put any European free jazz on the stereo. Indeed, we have on occasion used G\u00fcnter \u201cBaby\u201d Sommer\u2019s H\u00f6rmusik solo percussion album to drive him from the room when he made a smell. In a heated late-night, pro-European argument with my pro-Brexit stepbrother two weeks ago, I used the contented cat\u2019s obvious happiness underneath the European flag to show him how Europe could shelter and comfort us, like cats under a flag. My stepbrother, brilliantly, snatched the European flag off the cat\u2019s back, to show how the creature, and by association the nation, was quite capable of functioning without the embrace of Europe. I think this is an example of the kind of easy-to-understand argument the British public claim has been denied them in favour of tedious figures and facts about trade, environmental legislation, human rights and immigration. The cat looked annoyed and eyed both of us with resentment. Already, the Brexit debate is tearing families apart, stepbrother against stepbrother, stepbrother against stepbrother-in-law, stepbrother-in-law against stepcat. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be in Japan by now, anyway?\u201d he said, throwing my flag on the fire. A few days later I arrived in the so-called Land of the Rising Sun for a meeting with the famous Studio Haino, who had begun work on an anime version of my multiple Bafta- and British comedy award-winning BBC2 series, Stewart Lee\u2019s Comedy Vehicle, which they believed would play well with young Asian hipsters, jaded geisha and disillusioned samurai. Because Fuck! Stewart Lee Pee-pee Charabanc (the literal Japanese translation of Studio Haino\u2019s new title for the show) was already expected to be a big hit, various merchandise spinoffs were almost up and running. A string of love beads, each sporting a different picture of my face, is already available in Japanese adult stores. And since January I have been wearing four or five new pairs of pants a day, all of which will eventually take pride of place, when suitably soiled, in vending machines on the streets of Tokyo\u2019s most fashionable districts. My wife, of course, finds this turn of events ridiculous, but she will be laughing on the other side of her stupid face when the flyblown briefs she currently uses as dishcloths become priceless collector\u2019s items. And, in the increasingly likely event of a British Brexit, the sale of these fetishised items will then fund our family\u2019s relocation to the newly independent free Scotland, from where I will harry the airwaves of England and Wales with liberally biased leftwing satire, the Lord Haw Haw of sparkling wine socialism. In retrospect, the scrum of the Scottish independence referendum looks dignified compared to the dirty war of Brexit. In Scotland, politicians on both sides of the divide at least seemed sincere in their beliefs, rather than selfishly using the nation\u2019s concerns about its future to try and secure theirs. Indeed, the day when Boris Johnson cynically accused the pro-Europe and \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d President Obama of being ancestrally ill-disposed towards Britain marks the moment at which the mayor of London changed from being merely a twat, into a full-blown c**t. It is appropriate to describe Boris with pure witless swearing, for that is all he deserves. He is of a political class where any insult, no matter how&nbsp;vicious, is acceptable, if it is delivered with the rhetorical flourishes and classical allusions of the public-school debating society. Hence, Cameron can scornfully sneer at Jeremy Corbyn, and describe Dennis Skinner as a dinosaur, yet the venerable beast himself is dismissed from the house when he calls Cameron merely \u201cdodgy\u201d. The problem for the pro-Europe voter currently is that, while obviously despising Cameron as both a person and a politician, one nonetheless wants him to prevail over Boris, Gove, Iain Duncan Smith and the Brexit camp. And as the giant moth arrived above the beach, momentarily blocking out the Japanese sun itself, and set about the three-headed lizard with electric rays from its head, I continued to ponder the Brexit campaign. \u201cDid he who made the lamb make thee?\u201d, asks William Blake of The Tyger. It was instinct that drove the moth and the lizard to fight, not ethics. They were as they were. Likewise, Boris\u2019s Brexit position represents only a fight for personal betterment, not a considered view on Europe. There is an African fly that lays its eggs in the jelly of children\u2019s eyes, the hatching larvae blinding them by feeding on the eye itself. But the fly has no quarrel with the child. It is merely following its nature. Likewise Boris, a vile grub laying his horrible eggs in the soft jelly of the EU debate, has no agenda beyond his own advancement. He believes in nothing, and neither does his spiritual soulmate, the eye-scoffing African fly. We cowered in our cave, the twins and I, and watched the combat of the monsters. The honest open war of the&nbsp;giant moth and three-headed lizard made prime minister\u2019s questions seem contrived and banal. The earth shook beneath their feet, triggering tidal waves and rivers of lava from the atoll\u2019s smouldering volcano; vast explosions of startled birds scarred the sky; the landscape cracked. There was no \u201cMr Speaker\u201d, no \u201corder order\u201d, no classical allusion and no drawing-room wit. There was only war, terrible war.

However the F1 chief executive, Bernie Ecclestone, stated on Sunday morning that he was not in favour of employing the cockpit safety system. Whiting also confirmed that there is a timetable in place for a decision to be made between the two systems currently being tested, the halo device and Red Bull\u2019s aeroscreen, which made its first appearance in Sochi on Friday in practice. The deadline for confirming which device will be instituted was 1 July, Whiting said, to allow teams time to incorporate it into their designs for next year\u2019s cars, which will also be subject to the new aero and engine regulations that were confirmed this week. \u201cIt would be unreasonable if we didn\u2019t have a clear path by that time,\u201d said Whiting. \u201cIt would be fairly unreasonable to expect teams to change chassis which is what it amounts to because this is a fundamental part of it. Their chassis design is normally fixed by this time. It\u2019s only a small part of the chassis and it\u2019s not going to affect things like fuel volume and those big things but it\u2019s still part of a complex design process.\u201d Ecclestone, speaking at the track in Sochi on Sunday morning, was less enamoured of the concept. When asked what Formula One should do on the cockpit safety question he answered \u201cnothing\u201d and asserted that racing should continue with an open cockpit. \u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said and added that he did not believe it would necessarily achieve its goal, before questioning the testing methods the devices had undergone. He asked why the sport should \u201ctry to simulate something where you have a stationary object and fire a tyre at it, when in the race when the wheel has come off normally both cars will be moving? \u201cSo how can you simulate it by having a car stationary? And how would you ever know what is going to happen with a wheel? If it hits the thing it will probably bounce off anyway.\u201d The halo device, tested by Ferrari during preseason, was understood to be the strong favourite to be employed but the success of Red Bull\u2019s aeroscreen, which they will run again in free practice in Spain and Monaco, has levelled the playing field. \u201cBoth devices are equally likely,\u201d said Whiting. \u201cA couple of months ago I would have said that the Red Bull solution was not likely to be implemented in 2017 but they have really accelerated the work on it in a short space of time to bring it to the point where it has now been tested successfully in the same way as the halo.\u201d Ecclestone\u2019s opinions are likely to hold little sway with the FIA which, although it could impose the device on teams, is unlikely to feel the need to do so, although a unanimous agreement would still be required to introduce a device in 2017. \u201cEveryone\u2019s aware that we want to press ahead with this,\u201d Whiting said. \u201cWe are not expecting any teams to object, simply because it is a matter of safety. We are not expecting to have to invoke the safety card.\u201d If both devices reach the same safety standard the decision on which to choose will be put to the F1 commission.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s probably all you need to know from me for now. Thank you for joining us at Guardian Australia today, and throughout the season. It\u2019s been a belter. And it\u2019s Eugene Galekovic who receives the trophy from the FFA chairman. He makes a little speech beforehand, referencing the perilous position of his team after round eight, and then eschews the traditional platform to join his team-mates in front of a perfect photo-op and hoists the golden toilet side into the air. \u201cCampiones, campiones ole ole ole!\u201d rings out as golden confetti spurts out over the players. Nikolai Topor-Stanley said a few words on behalf of his team. Poor bloke must be devastated. Adelaide\u2019s players now receiving their medals, Michael Marrone on crutches. Steven Lowy at the end of the presentation line looks a lot surer footed on the dais than his old man. This one was never in doubt from the moment the Spaniard\u2019s free kick sent Adelaide two-nil up. His performance was more than just one swing of the boot though. Defensively he was vital, intercepting, tackling, disrupting. Going forward he kept Adelaide in motion, albeit without their regular fluency. It was gripping, breathless, and not entirely according to script. Neither side really asserted their preferred playing style on the match but a marvellous spectacle ensued regardless. Western Sydney Wanderers gave their all but lacked composure in the final third to convert their rapid and frequent attacks into clear threats on goal. A third grand final goes begging for Tony Popovic. After two previous grand final defeats Adelaide United finally tasted victory courtesy of two moments of first half brilliance. The second, from Isaias, was the standout incident of the game. The best team of the home and away season were the best team in the finals. Congratulations Guillermo Amor and Adelaide United. Scenes of jubilation around Adelaide Oval. Delirious supporters, captain Eugene Galekovic in tears, leader Bruce Djite celebrating his special \u2018family\u2019. Ladies and gentlemen, Adelaide United are your A-League champions. 92 min: Adelaide Oval is rocking now. Victory is secured. The premiers become champions. They were made to work in the second half but they rode their luck and fought back in style. Game over! Pablo Sanchez seals it for Adelaide United. An unerring strike past Redmayne inside the box. There was nothing on until the substitute robbed Baccus on the edge of the penalty area, strode forward and smashed home the winner. 90 min: A minimum of three minutes of added time to be played. 89 min: Kamau remains Adelaide\u2019s outlet on the break and he\u2019s run his socks off to help his team hem the Wanderers in towards the right-hand corner flag. Not long left for the visitors now. 87 min: Mauk fires in a snapshot from the edge of the box that fizzes past Redmayne\u2019s left-hand post. Wanderers still pressing, still on top, but Adelaide resisting. 85 min: Baccus has done well since he came on and his crisp through ball reaches Castelen and he forces a corner. Dimas takes it and Topor-Stanley thumps a good header goalwards that\u2019s dealt with by the safe hands of Galekovic. Pablo Sanchez replaces Marcelo Carrusca for Adelaide. Shannon Cole is on for Scott Jamieson for Western Sydney. 81 min: Dimas the latest Wanderer into the book, probably more for his explosive reaction to being adjudged to have fouled Goodwin. Another chance for Adelaide to break up the play. It almost leads to a goal too as Carrusca whips in a cross that Redmayne struggles to deal with. Kamau then goes to ground far too easily again and the Wanderers escape. 79 min: Pressure relieving corner for Adelaide and Carrusca milks the clock to stem the flow. The header from the dangerous delivery flies behind. Final 10 minutes of a gripping game. 77 min: 88%-12% possession in favour of Western Sydney over the last five minutes. It hasn\u2019t converted to goals yet though as another chance goes begging. This time Neville\u2019s pullback trickles agonisingly through the Adelaide box. Andreu off for Kearyn Baccus - second Wanderers substitution. 75 min: Adelaide can\u2019t retain possession high up the field. Kamau the latest to be bullied off the ball. Consequently the ball keeps heading back at speed, carried by a man in white. Vidosic and Bridge are increasingly influential. Castelen is seeing plenty of the ball but he\u2019s not been as penetrating as he was against Brisbane, so far... 73 min: Substitution for Adelaide. Elrich a more than handy replacement for the injured Marrone. Amor will presumably instruct the Socceroo to push his defence up the field. They are sliding further and further to wards Galekovic and inviting the Wanderers to attack them. 72 min: Proper cup tie stuff now. The crowd at fever pitch. Adelaide panicky in possession. Wanderers pressing. Glorious theatre. 70 min: Disallowed goal for Adelaide! Corner from the right leads to a scramble and the ball ricochets its way in but the linesman\u2019s flag is up for offside. It looks debatable. Cirio adjudged to be offside and interfering with play while he was on the ground nearby Redmayne. Replays confirm a brilliant call from the assistant referee. It took eagle eyes and bravery to make that call, credit where it\u2019s due. 69 min: Backs to the wall by Adelaide. One punch away from a knockout just 10 minutes ago, now they\u2019re fighting to remain ahead. Chances are coming at both ends though as the game stretches. Djite almost scores from a deep cross from the left but his header is repelled by Redmayne scrambling towards his far post. This is dynamic stuff now. 67 min: Another Wanderers attack leads to a half chance for Castelen and his volleyed effort forces a corner. Jamieson again can\u2019t beat the first defender. Double forfeit for him for a second offence. The full-back has a chance to redeem himself in open play but his first-time cross just eludes the leaping Santalab, the return ball finds Vidosic but he heads tamely towards Galekovic. 64 min: Vidosic is stationed on the left with Bridge occupying the number 10 role vacated by Nichols. The change has worked too with pockets of space opening up all over the place. The space is also there for Adelaide too and Cirio exploits it, speeding towards the Wanderers\u2019 penalty area only to be met with a sumptuous tackle from Alberto. think Bobby Moore versus Pele in the 1970 World Cup. It\u2019s a full house... 61 min: Suddenly everything has changed. Wanderers are breaking through midfield at pace. Castelen the latest to fashion a chance. The energy levels have upped from the visitors and they\u2019re somehow finding space where none could be located in the first half. Wallop! Out of nowhere the Wanderers have one back. A small period of pressure sees Castelen and Santalab link up well on the right and feed Scott Neville to smash home his first goal for the club, arrowing one across Galekovic into the top corner. The comeback is on again! 56 min: When Western Sydney look like mounting an attack a red shirt always seems to be in the right place at the right time. Both full-backs have made telling tackles and Isaias is shepherding everything at the base of midfield. It would take something special to deny the Spaniard the Joe Marston Medal you\u2019d think. Vidosic on - Nichols off. Popovic has made his first move (maybe he\u2019s been reading this blog?). 54 min: The visitors are on the ropes. Adelaide are relentless. Attack after attack since half-time met with nervous clearances. Can United deliver the knockout blow? 52 min: Good example of Amor\u2019s tactical success. Goodwin forcing Castelen to defend in his own corner, not once but twice, and eventually Djite spins in the box to fire in a shot that runs out for a corner. Not a great sign for Popovic if that head to head down the Western Sydney right is in such defensive territory. 49 min: During the interval the lights took hold at Adelaide Oval and the glare and shadows of the first half are no more. All Adelaide in these opening exchanges, Redmayne forced into another save, this time from Cirio, after a good move down the right. Jamieson is unimpressed and whacks Isaias to become the third Wanderer in Gillett\u2019s notebook. 47 min: No changes from either coach at the break. The second period begins at a much more acceptable pace than the first. United take advantage and Mauk shoots from distance forcing a save from Redmayne. Second half underway at Adelaide Oval. Some half-time news for you. It appears the South Australian border does not screen for idiots. I know you\u2019re all thinking, \u201cwhat would Howcroft do at half-time?\u201d Well, funny you should ask. If I was Amor, I\u2019d do very little. I\u2019d probably tell Mauk to sit closer to Isaias and not allow Western Sydney to overrun them in midfield. If I was Popovic I\u2019d give this XI 10 minutes to show more composure in the final third before bringing Vidosic on in the playmaker role and invite him to prove me wrong. Did I get enough odd first/third person mix-ups in their? Good, on with the show! By the way, if you\u2019re following this along with the delayed coverage on SBS, welcome to the future. If only Australian broadcasting regulations would join us there. There\u2019s only one stat that matters, and that\u2019s the one on the glorious old scoreboard behind the goal Adelaide United found twice. I think that shows contested possessions anyway, my eyesight\u2019s not great. A decisive first half for Adelaide United. A feisty contest without much composure changed after 22 minutes when Kamau finished off Carrusca\u2019s good work. One of the all-time grand final highlights followed 12 minutes later with Isaias\u2019 free kick putting daylight between the best two teams in the A-League. Wanderers have looked lively, getting behind United on a number of occasions but their final ball has been disappointing. Plenty for Popovic to think about during the interval. 45 min: What should Popovic do? And when? He\u2019ll welcome half-time and a chance to tell Castelen to be more direct. Again the winger dithers after he\u2019d looked like he\u2019d beaten his man. Two minutes of stoppage time. 43 min: The ball is hot again in midfield, neither side owning it for any length of time. When Adelaide do string passes together they look dangerous though, almost getting in behind Jamieson. 41 min: Chances for Adelaide. Isaias is starting to run the midfield and his trickery feeds Djite and his power creates space in the area but his cross fails to hit its target, Mauk shooting over from the clearance. Andreu the second name in the book for a bad foul on Djite. 39 min: Wanderers are still creating half chances but their composure is letting them down, Castelen this time not appraising the situation effectively. Spot on Phil... 36 min: That was a strike befitting the venue and the occasion. Nothing Redmayne could do about it. Can the Wanderers get out of jail again? It will be much harder against the league\u2019s best defence. Isaias steps up, wraps his right boot around the ball and sends it arcing over the wall, past the post, and into the side netting of Redmayne\u2019s goal. Centimetre perfect from the Spaniard. 33 min: Kamau tripped on the edge of the D by Topor-Stanley. First yellow card of the game and a free-kick in a very dangerous situation. 31 min: Suggestions the ball\u2019s bobbling a little on the Adelaide Oval surface. Not that Castelen seems to mind, dribbling with purpose past Goodwin and into the box. A corner results that again fails to beat the first man, Dimas the culprit. An immediate corner is much better and loops to the edge of the six yard box in the centre of goal but Santalab can\u2019t steer his stooping header on target. ONe of those chances that looks tough at full speed but wasteful in slow motion. 29 min: It\u2019s now Western Sydney that are attacking with speed, Adelaide more methodical in possession, defending their lead. The visitors look like creating chances when they break but the final ball has so far evaded their forward targets. Neither side really operating as you might have imagined pregame. Both midfields pressuring the six role, forcing the fullbacks to play the first release pass. 26 min: Chance for Wanderers! Excellent breakaway down the left and the cross just eludes the diving Santalab at the far post. This has livened up nicely in recent minutes. Amor can feel satisfied with Kamau\u2019s goal. Had he opted to select Elrich at left-back, Kamau would have been the likely started shuffled out. 24 min: An early home goal is perfect for the spectacle. The Wanderers were disrupting play successfully in the early exchanges, now they\u2019ll have to commit to attacking. By the way, that\u2019s the second fastest grand final goal and just the sixth first-half effort in the decider. Adelaide Oval erupts as Bruce Kamau opens the scoring. A lovely move down the left sees Carrusca in behind the Wanderers\u2019 defence. His cross is perfectly timed for the onrushing Kamau to nip in front of his marker and steer past Redmayne. 21 min: Corner to Wanderers now and a better set-piece finds Santalab who volleys acrobatically over the bar. Flare lighting suspect number one spotted in the travelling RBB. 19 min: Another unnecessary corner conceded, this time by Scott Jamieson. A dreadful short corner routine comes to nought though, despite some penalty area pinball from the second and third phase play. Good refereeing from Gillett allows an advantage to the counterattacking Wanderers but Mark Bridge\u2019s final ball fails to hit a target. Maybe a football match is breaking out after all. 17 min: Wanderers will be the happier of the two sides so far. The broken nature of the midfield battle has denied United any time on the ball. They\u2019re not going to suffer the same fate as Melbourne City. 15 min: Pinball in midfield pretty much the pattern of the opening quarter of an hour. This one still waiting for the adrenaline to ebb away and a real football match to materialise. 13 min: Some nervy defending from Adelaide gifts Western Sydney a corner but it doesn\u2019t beat the first man. If I ruled the world that would be an immediate forfeit for the corner taker. Maybe ten press-ups, or being prevented from having their parting shaved into their head for the rest of the year. 12 min: Can we call a brace of Bruces, Bruci? 11 min: Adelaide attacking as quickly as they can, looking for both Bruces with long passes. One almost reaches Djite but Alberto manages to hook a despairing leg around the ball to clear. 8 min: This one hasn\u2019t settled down yet. Lots of misplaced passes, poor control and plenty of physical contact. Both teams leaving boots in, throwing elbows around and making sure their presence is being felt. Needs a cool head or two to calm this one down. 6 min: First corner of the game goes to the home side and it\u2019s a decent delivery from Carrusca that Redmayne does well to punch clear. Santalab almost breaks the United offside trap. For the second time today Adelaide\u2019s high line has looked vulnerable. Almost immediately afterwards Santalab clatters Sergio Cirio and receives a stern talking to. In twenty minutes that will be a booking. 4 min: First chance of the game goes to the away team and they butcher it. A counterattack ends with a three on two and Nichols in possession but he picks the wrong option in Castelen and his shot blazes over. Warning signs for the United back four. 2 min: If you\u2019re interested in this sort of thing, Adelaide are kicking towards the Cathedral End, the one with the old scoreboard, which means the Wanderers are attacking the Bradman Stand end. The pitch is partly in shadow, particularly the right-back region of the Wanderers\u2019 half of the pitch. There is the potential for the low sun to be an issue for the goalkeepers. Adelaide dominating the early exchanges, circulating the ball from side to side, drawing a couple of fouls and trying to isolate Bruce Kamau against Scott Jamieson. Jarred Gillett\u2019s whistle pierces the air and heralds the final kick off of the A-League season. Vamos! Bonnie Anderson with the national anthem \u2013 and it\u2019s a solid, unfussy, a cappella affair. It ends, of course, with a huge roar from the crowd. Just a couple of minutes away from kick-off at Adelaide Oval and it is an impressive scene. A beautiful stadium packed to the rafters with plenty of away fans contributing to the atmosphere. As you\u2019d expect, United are in all red with a yellow trim, Wanderers in their away kit of white shirts, black shorts and white socks. The noise as Eugene Galekovic and Nikolai Topor-Stanley lead out their teams is deafening! OK, time to put my reputation on the line... I\u2019m tipping Adelaide United 1-0 with a second-half winner. Stefan Mauk to win the Joe Marston Medal. Feel free to shoot me down. Where do you think the grand final will be won and lost? Here\u2019s a selection of areas I\u2019ll be looking out for. Tempo - Both teams will want to control possession and dictate terms. Both midfields are set-up to recycle the ball well with the number six position the major arterial route. Adelaide destroyed Melbourne City in their semi final by hassling them off the ball from the get go and never allowing them to establish a rhythm. Stefan Mauk in particular sets the tone for United and his ability to press Dimas and Andreu could be vital. Possession - I expect Wanderers to play a containing game early, perhaps for as long as an hour. They\u2019ll look to quieten the crowd, figure Adelaide out and deny them space around and behind their defence. Key to this will be the discipline and efficiency of Dimas &amp; Andreu. On the flipside United have Isaias who is as comfortable making long direct passes from deep as he is knocking it about tiki taka style. His partnership with Marcelo Carrusca in more advanced positions will need to be crisp to pierce one of the strongest spines in the A-League. Width - Romeo Castelen may be the most dangerous individual on display in this final and he will be head to head with Craig Goodwin in a battle that could decide the contest. Coming off a hat-trick the Dutchman will be flying, but how much defensive responsibility will he have for the rampaging Goodwin heading the other way? Against City, Adelaide\u2019s dominance was such that both fullbacks were near second wingers and that detail won\u2019t have escaped the eye of the meticulous Popovic. Keepers - Perhaps the only area of the pitch in which either side has a clear advantage. Eugene Galekovic is Adelaide\u2019s captain and in the running for player of the season. It\u2019s no coincidence his club\u2019s fortunes improved when he returned from early season injury. The same cannot be said for Andrew Redmayne who started the season brightly but lost his place to Liam Reddy. Substitutes - Both benches are strong and likely to be relevant late on with such a close recent history between these two sides. Question marks over the fitness of a few Wanderers means Popovic could be forced to call on the likes of Dario Vidosic and Shannon Cole earlier than he might otherwise choose. Conditions are perfect for football in Adelaide today. The sun is shining, the temperature will be around 18C throughout and the light westerly breeze will die down after kick off. The choice of venue remains a point of debate. Adelaide Oval is a near sellout with only a few hundred standing tickets available on the day, and that alone is sound justification to shift from the much smaller Coopers Stadium. It is a cricket oval though, and one that hosted an AFL fixture yesterday. How the surface holds up as the game goes on will be worth keeping an eye on, as will the influence of the crowd, much further away from the action than they would be at a purpose built rectangular venue. Grand final stat attack: The last three games between these teams have ended in a draw, including nil-all draws in each of the last two. Adelaide United have won three and drawn four of their last eight matches against the Wanderers, their only loss coming in their third and final clash of the 2015 campaign. This will be the first play-off fixture between the two clubs in the A-League. Not since the 2012/13 season has either team scored more than two goals in an iteration of this fixture. Coming into the grand final, Adelaide have lost just one of their last 20 games (W15 D4), including wins in each of the last four. Five of the last seven winners of the Premier\u2019s Plate have gone onto win the grand final, including the last two champions (Melbourne Victory \u2013 2015, Brisbane Roar \u2013 2014). Never before have Adelaide United won consecutive play-off matches in the A-League, although, they have now won two of their last three finals games. Western Sydney Wanderers have netted 11 goals in their last three A-League matches, including five goals in a 5-4 thriller last time out. In their sixth play-off match, the Wanderers will finally face a team other than Brisbane Roar or Central Coast Mariners; they\u2019ve won three of their five play-off matches thus far. Both Adelaide United and Western Sydney Wanderers have scored 49 goals from 28 games so far this campaign, though Adelaide have conceded eight fewer. Brendon Santalab has a conversion rate of 47.8%, the highest percentage of any player who has attempted at least 10 shots (11 goals). Indeed, Santalab has scored five goals in his last three games for the Wanderers. Bruce Djite has scored six goals in his last four A-League matches for Adelaide, scoring on each occasion. Less than an hour to go. It\u2019s the (grand) final countdown. Your referee today is Jarred Gillett. Gillett, one of the three inaugural FFA full-time referees, was named the A-League referee of the year this week. He will be joined by assistant referees Matthew Cream and Luke Brennan with Paul Cetrangolo as the fourth official. Strebre Delovski and Chris Beath are the additional assistant referees (the ones behind the goal who may or may not do anything beyond window dressing). Tony Popovic is also sticking with a winning formula, backing the XI that did the business against Brisbane Roar. That means injury doubts over Mitch Nichols have been allayed and semi-final hero Dario Vidosic will have to make do with a place on the bench. Popovic has backed in his 4-2-1-3 formation from round one, a system built on the dual pivot of Dimas and Andreu at the base of midfield. No news is good news for Adelaide United with the home side unchanged for the fifth match in row. Arguably the only decision Guillermo Amor had to make was over Tarek Elrich\u2019s involvement at left-back but a winning team has not been tinkered with. Structurally this should play out as a 4-1-1-1-3 with Stefan Mauk linking Isaias and Marcello Carrusca in midfield. Remember, this is more fun for everyone when you join in and interrupt my rambling stream of consciousness.

Western Sydney Wanderers kicked off the 2015-16 A-League season way back on a Thursday night in early October. They lost 3-1 at home to Brisbane Roar. The following evening Adelaide United hosted Melbourne Victory in a forgettable 0-0 draw. Twenty-six rounds and four playoff matches later the best two teams in the competition will go head to head to decide this year\u2019s champions. If you have a confident prediction for who\u2019s going to leave Adelaide Oval with the toilet seat, you\u2019re either clairvoyant or bluffing. It\u2019s hard to imagine a match-up of professional football teams anywhere in the world being this close. All three matches between the pair this season have ended in draws, the most recent two goalless ones. Historically the record is even too with four wins apiece, balanced by four draws. In their 28 games both have scored 49 goals. They were separated on the ladder by just one point. But what a crucial point that turned out to be. It provides Adelaide United with home state advantage (I\u2019m reluctant to call it home ground advantage as Coopers Stadium is United\u2019s real home) in a season in which away sides have struggled more than most in recent history. Whichever first-time winner prevails will have a story to tell. For Adelaide, winless and bottom after eight matches, the turnaround has been miraculous. For Western Sydney, the second incarnation of Tony Popovic\u2019s vision has startled by the immediacy of its impact. Both will be worthy champions. Kick-off is not until 4pm so settle back, join in, and soak up all the atmosphere of Australian football\u2019s showpiece event. Hey ho, let\u2019s go! JP Howcroft will be with you shortly but in the meantime, check out David Squires\u2019 grand final preview cartoon. It\u2019s another screamer.",

Here\u2019s a selection of areas I\u2019ll be looking out for.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Tempo</strong> - Both teams will want to control possession and dictate terms. Both midfields are set-up to recycle the ball well with the number six position the major arterial route. Adelaide destroyed Melbourne City in their semi final by hassling them off the ball from the get go and never allowing them to establish a rhythm. Stefan Mauk in particular sets the tone for United and his ability to press Dimas and Andreu could be vital. <br /></li> <li><strong>Possession</strong> - I expect Wanderers to play a containing game early, perhaps for as long as an hour. They\u2019ll look to quieten the crowd, figure Adelaide out and deny them space around and behind their defence. Key to this will be the discipline and efficiency of Dimas &amp; Andreu. On the flipside United have Isaias who is as comfortable making long direct passes from deep as he is knocking it about tiki taka style. His partnership with Marcelo Carrusca in more advanced positions will need to be crisp to pierce one of the strongest spines in the A-League.<br /></li> <li><strong>Width</strong> - Romeo Castelen may be the most dangerous individual on display in this final and he will be head to head with Craig Goodwin in a battle that could decide the contest. Coming off a hat-trick the Dutchman will be flying, but how much defensive responsibility will he have for the rampaging Goodwin heading the other way? Against City, Adelaide\u2019s dominance was such that both fullbacks were near second wingers and that detail won\u2019t have escaped the eye of the meticulous Popovic.</li> <li><strong>Keepers</strong> - Perhaps the only area of the pitch in which either side has a clear advantage. Eugene Galekovic is Adelaide\u2019s captain and in the running for player of the season. It\u2019s no coincidence his club\u2019s fortunes improved when he returned from early season injury. The same cannot be said for Andrew Redmayne who started the season brightly but lost his place to Liam Reddy. </li> <li><strong>Substitutes</strong> - Both benches are strong and likely to be relevant late on with such a close recent history between these two sides. Question marks over the fitness of a few Wanderers means Popovic could be forced to call on the likes of Dario Vidosic and Shannon Cole earlier than he might otherwise choose.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd4a711fe44922a517fbbb48bd336e322e193bc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd4a711fe44922a517fbbb48bd336e322e193bc4/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adelaide skipper Eugene Galekovic is set to play a key role in the A-League grand final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adelaide skipper Eugene Galekovic is set to play a key role in the A-League grand final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Morne de Klerk/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-01T05:54:46.745Z\">at 6.54am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5725954fe4b0a2f120514b81\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-01T05:34:15.193Z\">6.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SJR1978/status/726643917454598144\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Adelaide oval looks and sounds tremendous! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ALeagueGF?src=hash\">#ALeagueGF</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/sbsaleague?src=hash\">#sbsaleague</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/G9g5qiqkop\">pic.twitter.com/G9g5qiqkop</a></p>&mdash; Stuart Randall (@SJR1978) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SJR1978/status/726643917454598144\">May 1, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57256847e4b0a2f120514b64\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-01T05:30:40.439Z\">6.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Conditions are perfect for football in Adelaide today.

How the surface holds up as the game goes on will be worth keeping an eye on, as will the influence of the crowd, much further away from the action than they would be at a purpose built rectangular venue.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-572566fce4b0f300275c80e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-01T05:22:40.547Z\">6.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Grand final stat attack:</p> <ul> <li>The last three games between these teams have ended in a draw, including nil-all draws in each of the last two.<br /></li> <li>Adelaide United have won three and drawn four of their last eight matches against the Wanderers, their only loss coming in their third and final clash of the 2015 campaign.<br /></li> <li>This will be the first play-off fixture between the two clubs in the A-League.</li> <li>Not since the 2012/13 season has either team scored more than two goals in an iteration of this fixture.<br /></li> <li>Coming into the grand final, Adelaide have lost just one of their last 20 games (W15 D4), including wins in each of the last four.<br /></li> <li>Five of the last seven winners of the Premier\u2019s Plate have gone onto win the grand final, including the last two champions (Melbourne Victory \u2013 2015, Brisbane Roar \u2013 2014).<br /></li> <li>Never before have Adelaide United won consecutive play-off matches in the A-League, although, they have now won two of their last three finals games.<br /></li> <li>Western Sydney Wanderers have netted 11 goals in their last three A-League matches, including five goals in a 5-4 thriller last time out.<br /></li> <li>In their sixth play-off match, the Wanderers will finally face a team other than Brisbane Roar or Central Coast Mariners; they\u2019ve won three of their five play-off matches thus far.</li> <li>Both Adelaide United and Western Sydney Wanderers have scored 49 goals from 28 games so far this campaign, though Adelaide have conceded eight fewer.<br /></li> <li>Brendon Santalab has a conversion rate of 47.8%, the highest percentage of any player who has attempted at least 10 shots (11 goals).<br /></li> <li>Indeed, Santalab has scored five goals in his last three games for the Wanderers.<br /></li> <li>Bruce Djite has scored six goals in his last four A-League matches for Adelaide, scoring on each occasion.<br /></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2d69982aedf8c06b3c6fbbe9921c80457ae2491\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2d69982aedf8c06b3c6fbbe9921c80457ae2491/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Djite is the man in form for Adelaide United, scoring six goals in his last four outings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bruce Djite is the man in form for Adelaide United, scoring six goals in his last four outings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Morne de Klerk/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-01T05:24:08.041Z\">at 6.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-572571e8e4b0f300275c80f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-01T05:19:15.389Z\">6.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Less than an hour to go.

They lost 3-1 at home to Brisbane Roar. The following evening Adelaide United hosted Melbourne Victory in a forgettable 0-0 draw. Twenty-six rounds and four playoff matches later the best two teams in the competition will go head to head to decide this year\u2019s champions.</p> <p>If you have a confident prediction for who\u2019s going to leave Adelaide Oval with the toilet seat, you\u2019re either clairvoyant or bluffing. It\u2019s hard to imagine a match-up of professional football teams anywhere in the world being this close. All three matches between the pair this season have ended in draws, the most recent two goalless ones. Historically the record is even too with four wins apiece, balanced by four draws. In their 28 games both have scored 49 goals. They were separated on the ladder by just one point.</p> <p>But what a crucial point that turned out to be. It provides Adelaide United with home state advantage (I\u2019m reluctant to call it home ground advantage as Coopers Stadium is United\u2019s real home) in a season in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/apr/22/friday-focus-home-ground-advantage-could-sway-a-league-finals\">away sides have struggled </a>more than most in recent history. </p> <p>Whichever first-time winner prevails will have a story to tell. For Adelaide, winless and bottom after eight matches, the turnaround has been miraculous. For Western Sydney, the second incarnation of Tony Popovic\u2019s vision has startled by the immediacy of its impact. Both will be worthy champions.</p> <p>Kick-off is not until 4pm so settle back, join in, and soak up all the atmosphere of Australian football\u2019s showpiece event. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ae75daaba37c7a68dd68f9a1b42d63dc60b2faf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ae75daaba37c7a68dd68f9a1b42d63dc60b2faf/0_0_4471_2934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The treasured toilet seat is within reach for Adelaide United and Western Sydney Wanderers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The treasured toilet seat is within reach for Adelaide United and Western Sydney Wanderers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Macmahon/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-01T05:16:52.100Z\">at 6.16am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-572587cfe4b0f300275c8105\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-01T04:37:02.387Z\">5.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hey ho, let\u2019s go!</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuOnePNlOgY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xuOnePNlOgY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Hey ho, let\u2019s go!</figcaption> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5722f5a6e4b02046f02ebf6b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-29T05:49:17.562Z\">6.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>JP Howcroft will be with you shortly but in the meantime, check out David Squires\u2019 grand final preview cartoon.

      "bodyText": "There would be no dramatic comeback from the Western Sydney Wanderers this time. It was a grand final that had it all \u2013 a sell-out crowd, a play off between the top two sides vying for their first A-League title and some late suspense. In the end, however, two first-half goals and a late strike from super-sub Pablo Sanchez was enough for Adelaide United. The Reds won the game in the first half, going ahead on 22 minutes through Bruce Kamau and then again on 34 minutes after an inch-perfect free-kick by Isaias. It wasn\u2019t a classic performance from the Reds but it was efficient \u2013 Marcelo Carrusca provided the creativity, Kamau the spark and Craig Goodwin a solid defensive performance at left-back. Whether by bus, train, car or plane, a sea of red and black flooded Adelaide\u2019s streets, but it was always going to be a huge effort for the Wanderers after last week, where they came back from three goals down to beat Brisbane Roar 5-4. For a moment a second-half comeback looked on the cards, but it wasn\u2019t to be. Was last week their grand final performance? Certainly for the first half they looked out of sorts, lacking rhythm going forward and struggling to gain control in the centre of the park. Their brightest spark was Brendan Santalab, their serial pest up front, who looked to pounce on the break and took a chunk out of Cirio\u2019s leg in the opening minutes. It was Santalab that brought life to the game on the 20 minute mark. His outrageous, frog-in-the-blender bicycle kick sailed over the bar, and in the very next move, Adelaide United got the opening goal. It was Carrusca who found space down the left hand side, and with plenty of time swung a dangerous pass across goal. Poor defending from Wanderers left-back Scott Jamieson allowed Kamau to dart inside and side foot the ball into the back of the net. The majority of the 50,119 crowd went wild. Brimming with confidence, just after the half-hour mark Kamau drew a foul just outside the penalty box. Adelaide midfielder Isaias picked his spot, and right in front of the Red and Black Bloc, placed an inch-perfect free-kick in the top left hand corner. The Spaniard was later named winner of the Joe Marston medal. Running toward a bay of thousands of their own fans, the Wanderers came out much better in the second-half. Their hero from last week, Romeo Castelen, who was shut out for most of the first half by Goodwin, found room to cross the ball to Santalab.

It was a grand final that had it all \u2013 a sell-out crowd, a play off between the top two sides vying for their first A-League title and some late suspense. In the end, however, two first-half goals and a late strike from super-sub Pablo Sanchez was enough for Adelaide United.</p> <p> The Reds won the game in the first half, going ahead on 22 minutes through Bruce Kamau and then again on 34 minutes after an inch-perfect free-kick by Isaias. It wasn\u2019t a classic performance from the Reds but it was efficient \u2013 Marcelo Carrusca provided the creativity, Kamau the spark and Craig Goodwin a solid defensive performance at left-back.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/01/a-league-grand-final-adelaide-united-v-western-sydney-wanderers-live\">Adelaide United beat Western Sydney Wanderers in A-League grand final \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Whether by bus, train, car or plane, a sea of red and black flooded Adelaide\u2019s streets, but it was always going to be a huge effort for the Wanderers after last week, where they came back from three goals down <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/24/western-sydney-wanderers-into-a-league-grand-final-after-nine-goal-thriller\">to beat Brisbane Roar 5-4</a>. For a moment a second-half comeback looked on the cards, but it wasn\u2019t to be. Was last week their grand final performance?</p> <p> Certainly for the first half they looked out of sorts, lacking rhythm going forward and struggling to gain control in the centre of the park. Their brightest spark was Brendan Santalab, their serial pest up front, who looked to pounce on the break and took a chunk out of Cirio\u2019s leg in the opening minutes.</p> <p> It was Santalab that brought life to the game on the 20 minute mark. His outrageous, frog-in-the-blender bicycle kick sailed over the bar, and in the very next move, Adelaide United got the opening goal. </p> <p> It was Carrusca who found space down the left hand side, and with plenty of time swung a dangerous pass across goal. Poor defending from Wanderers left-back Scott Jamieson allowed Kamau to dart inside and side foot the ball into the back of the net. The majority of the 50,119 crowd went wild.</p> <p>Brimming with confidence, just after the half-hour mark Kamau drew a foul just outside the penalty box. Adelaide midfielder Isaias picked his spot, and right in front of the Red and Black Bloc, placed an inch-perfect free-kick in the top left hand corner. The Spaniard was later named winner of the Joe Marston medal.<br /></p> <p> Running toward a bay of thousands of their own fans, the Wanderers came out much better in the second-half. Their hero from last week, Romeo Castelen, who was shut out for most of the first half by Goodwin, found room to cross the ball to Santalab. The striker\u2019s back-heel found Scott Neville, who blasted the ball past keeper Eugene Galekovic.

      "bodyText": "Imagine that you have nurtured an ambition for 25 years to head up an expedition to the last unexplored planet in the solar system. You\u2019ve worked your way up and through countless other suborbital, orbital and planetary missions. You\u2019ve written scores of scientific papers. Finally, you are the principal investigator on Nasa\u2019s New Horizons mission to Pluto \u2013 that mysterious little entity, a third of the size of our moon, that is located, depending on orbital position, between 2.6bn and 4.7bn miles from Earth. In January 2006, your probe leaves Earth on its nine-year journey to its historic destination. It is the crowning moment of your career, a landmark project; you\u2019ve reached the peak of your profession. Then, seven months later, with your spacecraft still in the early stages of its odyssey, it is announced, following a vote at a meeting of the International Astronomy Union (IAU) in Prague, that Pluto is no longer a planet. As the consequence of the findings of an ambitious planetary astronomer, the elite group of nine planets has overnight shrunk to eight, and your mission is now heading towards a \u201cdwarf planet\u201d, just another piece of ice and rock in the vast Kuiper belt, the band of mostly small bodies that forms the perimeter, the unglamorous outer suburbs, of the solar system. That\u2019s exactly what happened to Alan Stern a decade ago. Shift forward nine years, and New Horizons has just stunned the world with the clarity and drama of the images of Pluto sent back from its flyby. Hundreds of millions of people go online to look at them. Stern is the subject of international attention, feted, apparently vindicated, a man who appears to have answered his critics about the relevance of Pluto. But then, out of the blue, the same astronomer whose original research prompted the demotion of Pluto announces that he\u2019s discovered evidence of Planet Nine, a major planet somewhere between the size of Earth and Neptune, that could take the place of Pluto \u2013 the original ninth planet \u2013 in the known planetary system. That is exactly what Mike Brown did. Planetary science is a competitive field that, like any area of learning, can throw up bitter rivalries, but the stellar careers of Stern and Brown seem to be plotted along some kind of interplanetary collision course. When Brown made his announcement about Planet Nine, Stern tweeted: \u201cHype. There is no discovery.\u201d To say there is no love lost between the two scientists would be an exercise in colourless understatement. But their dispute is more than a clash of personalities, or even professional one-upmanship. It is about the nature of reality, how we make sense of the universe, the things in heaven and earth that are dreamt of in our philosophy. Stern is a small man with a big office, located in the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. A neatly groomed, 58-year-old ball of energy, he is an aerospace engineer, trained pilot and very proud and angry Pluto advocate. Stern is proud because New Horizons, which is continuing its journey beyond Pluto into the furthest reaches of the Kuiper belt, has been a huge success and will almost certainly transform our understanding of our cosmic surroundings. He is angry because he believes Pluto has been the victim of a personal vendetta and a shady conspiracy. Stern rejects the IAU vote that demoted Pluto to the status of dwarf planet. \u201cScience isn\u2019t about voting,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t vote on the theory of relativity. We don\u2019t vote on evolution. The image of scientists voting gives the public the impression that science is arbitrary.\u201d As far as he is concerned, the vote was the final stage of a campaign to discredit Clyde Tombaugh, the son of Kansas farmers who, as a 24-year-old researcher, discovered Pluto in 1930. \u201cThere was an astronomer named Brian Marsden who for decades had a grudge against Tombaugh. He had public fights that many people observed. Tombaugh died in 1997 and Marsden went on a jihad to diminish his reputation by removing Pluto from the list of planets. He eventually found a way to do that at a convention of astronomers, a meeting with thousands of people, of which a very small fraction \u2013 4% \u2013 went to a room where the vote was taken.\u201d Marsden, who was director of the IAU\u2019s Minor Planet Center in 2006, is himself dead, and it is impossible to prove or disprove Stern\u2019s allegations. But 10 years on, the decision taken that day still rankles with Stern. It annoys him that the science press didn\u2019t question the process. But what really gets to him is that the people who voted were astronomers and not, by and large, planetary scientists. He argues that they had little or no expertise in the field. \u201cJust as you shouldn\u2019t go to a paediatrist for brain surgery, you shouldn\u2019t go to an astronomer for expert advice on planetary science. My field is called planetary science. It involves the word planet in the name. As planetary scientists we should be able to understand what is and isn\u2019t the central object of the field. It isn\u2019t called \u2018things in space\u2019. It\u2019s called planetary science. Its about planets.\u201d Essentially, the IAU laid down three criteria for planetary status. The object has to be in orbit around the sun. It must have sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium, meaning it must be spherical by force of its own gravity. And it must have \u201ccleared the neighbourhood\u201d around its orbit, which is to say that it must be gravitationally dominant over surrounding objects. Pluto, the elliptical orbit of which is affected by Neptune\u2019s gravity, fails this test. Stern dismisses this criterion as too vague, arguing that it means Neptune shouldn\u2019t qualify as a planet. \u201cIf Neptune had cleared its zone,\u201d he has said, \u201cPluto wouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d \u201cMike Brown and some other people who for some reason would like to manage the number of planets to be small use a location-based definition, which is about what has cleared its zone. But it\u2019s a very poor scientific concept. I\u2019ll tell you why.\u201d He says the criterion means the physical properties of a given object are rendered meaningless because location determines classification. \u201cIf you accept at face value the zone clearing criteria, you can write down an equation for it. That equation depends upon several things, including the mass of the star it is orbiting, its distance from the star and how old it is. The most sensitive parameter is distance. As you go outward, the clearance zone gets bigger. And as you go outward the orbit speeds get progressively slower. So it takes a more and more massive object to clear the zone as you move farther out. Which means that objects that classify as planets close to a star cannot classify as a planet far from a star.\u201d Stern says that if Earth was located in Pluto\u2019s position in the solar system it also wouldn\u2019t qualify as a planet. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he says. He even claims that, according to the maths, Brown\u2019s Planet Nine would not quality for planetary status, \u201cno matter how massive it is\u201d. Brown\u2019s response is dismissive. \u201cEarth in the Kuiper belt? That would be fascinating, but there is no Earth in the Kuiper belt. Why not? Probably because the formation of the solar system has prevented such a thing from happening. \u201cThe solar system is so cleanly sorted into gravitationally dominant things (planets) and the tiny things that flit around between them (not planets), that that is telling us something truly interesting about the formation of the solar system.\u201d As for the notion that Planet Nine is disqualified from planetary status by the same criterion that disqualified Pluto, Brown says: \u201cThis is, of course, not true \u2013 and I\u2019m pretty sure Alan knows this. There is an elegant set of calculations by Jean-Luc Margot which attempts to put real math behind the vague \u2018cleared out the orbits\u2019 language. Planet Nine easily fulfils Margot\u2019s mathematical constraints.\u201d Yet the question remains, if the formation of the solar system prevented an Earth-size planet from being in the Kuiper belt, why didn\u2019t it prevent the still larger Planet Nine? The most likely theory is that, if it does exist, Planet Nine began its orbital life much closer to the sun and then crossed paths with a planet like Jupiter, which sent it spiralling into the outer reaches. Two more different characters than Stern and Brown it would be hard to conceive. When I visited Boulder, snow was on the ground, and there was something coiled and defensive about Stern, as if he were used to fighting for scare resources in a harsh environment. Brown is professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California. In Pasadena, the sun shone and the temperature was in the high 70s. Brown is Stern\u2019s junior by eight years, but they seem not just a generation but a whole culture apart. Brown was wearing shorts, Birkenstocks and a goatee beard when I visited his light-filled office on the Caltech campus. If the choice of epithets for the two men came down to \u201cuptight\u201d and \u201claid back\u201d, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to assign them. Ever since Tombaugh first discovered it, Pluto has held an uncertain position in planetary science. Initially it was thought to be roughly the mass of the Earth, owing to its presumed gravitational effect on Neptune and Uranus. But over the years that estimate was downgraded until now it is thought to be about one five-hundredth of the Earth\u2019s mass. In 2005, Brown discovered an object in the Kuiper belt that had greater mass than Pluto. This new body, called Eris, presented a classification problem. Either it was a 10th planet or, if it was not a planet, then neither was Pluto. Although he had always dreamed of finding a planet, Brown was inclined to the latter opinion. \u201cPluto,\u201d as he tells me, \u201cis essentially this insignificant chunk of ice that really is of no consequence in the solar system.\u201d He felt pleased when its planetary status was removed. \u201cIt was immensely satisfying to have the solar system described correctly for the first time. It\u2019s painful every time I see something that gives the wrong impression of reality.\u201d But a lot of people were sentimentally attached to the idea of Pluto and took against Brown\u2019s position. He wrote an entertaining and enlightening memoir about the experience of becoming a hate figure, entitled How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming. Stern believes the book has undermined Brown\u2019s objectivity. Interestingly, both Stern and Brown challenge each other\u2019s opinions on similar grounds. Both think the other is compromised by personal involvement, and each believes the other is responding irrationally owing to emotional reasons. \u201cMike\u2019s written a very successful book,\u201d Stern told me, \u201cso he\u2019s made a lot of money out of this. I don\u2019t get paid more or less depending on what I say, but he clearly does. So there\u2019s a bit of a conflict of interest. He\u2019s never going to change his mind because it will kill his book\u2019s sales.\u201d I checked Brown\u2019s Amazon bestseller position. His book was at 131,246 on the list \u2013 not a ranking likely to represent large or profitable sales. For his part, Brown says of Stern: \u201cWe should discount him. He\u2019s got a spacecraft that flew by Pluto. You kind of fall in love with the things you spend a spacecraft to. It matters to him personally that it\u2019s a planet. So ignore him.\u201d The two men accuse each other of suffering from nostalgia for a bygone age of certainties. In Stern\u2019s case, Brown says he wants a return to a time when Pluto was part of the canon, one of the dominant objects. Stern argues that, on the contrary, he believes in a whole new paradigm in which the solar system contains many planets \u2013 probably, be says, about 1,000. And it is Brown, he says, who is holding on to a vanishing past of few planets for fear that \u201cschoolchildren won\u2019t be able to remember their names\u201d. Stern reaches for a geographical analogy. \u201cWe don\u2019t limit the number of mountains or rivers of the Earth,\u201d he says. Brown counters with his own bit of geography. \u201cIt think it\u2019s important to us that there aren\u2019t that many planets. I think the word planet is like the word continent. There needs to be a smallish number of them. If every island was a continent, it wouldn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d Ultimately, he concedes, it comes down to what we want to believe. He says he asked a philosopher friend what does a word \u2013 like planet, for example \u2013 mean. \u201cHe said the word \u2018planet\u2019 means what people think about when they say the word \u2018planet\u2019, and I was like, \u2018Shut up!\u2019 But then I realised it\u2019s true. And the word \u2018planet\u2019 means, in our heads, a small number of large bodies in the solar system. I don\u2019t think it means everything round. It doesn\u2019t mean everything that goes round the sun.\u201d The official designation for Pluto, Eris, and several other objects found in the Kuiper Belt is dwarf planet. But of course, in an obvious sense, whatever we call Pluto doesn\u2019t change what it is. And what it is, according to Stern, is something of a surprise. \u201cNumber one surprise,\u201d he says, \u201cis that Pluto is so complex. If you plot the numbers of different kinds of geology we see on the surface, it rivals Earth and Mars. Generally, the smaller objects are simpler. Pluto is completely anomalous in that respect. And we didn\u2019t expect Pluto to be active geologically, four and half billion years after its birth. The heart-shaped region we call Sputnik Planum is a million square kilometres. It is the scale of the state of Texas and it was born yesterday. We can\u2019t find a single crater on it.\u201d To say that Pluto is an insignificant chunk of ice and rock may be true in the grand scheme of things, but meaning is not immanent in any planet or dwarf planet: it comprises what we impose on it. And Pluto is part of our history, a touchstone in our scientific journey outwards. There is probably no definition of the word planet that suits everyone. By Brown\u2019s understanding a planet can cease to be a planet if, for whatever reason, it changes location, while by Stern\u2019s reckoning the moon is a planet. As Brown says: \u201cDoes any scientist anywhere other than Stern think that the moon should be called a planet? I think this is the strongest argument against a geophysical definition.\u201d The latest research suggests that Brown\u2019s speculations about the existence of Planet Nine, based on the strange alignment of other bodies, may well be correct. If Pluto is ruled out, there have been only two planets discovered, other than by the naked eye, in human history: Uranus in 1781 and Neptune in 1846. So it would be a rare achievement to uncover a third. Brown says it is hard not to be aware of the historical significance. But Stern is having none of it. \u201cIt\u2019s not the ninth planet, right. I think it\u2019s a really insensitive terminology because it trashes Tombaugh\u2019s reputation. Either that or he\u2019s clueless. I don\u2019t know, ask him.\u201d I did. \u201cI think that\u2019s a desperate stretch,\u201d says Brown. And so it goes on, the two esteemed planetary scientists, circling one another like two great bodies struggling for gravitational superiority, both hoping to see the other\u2019s argument propelled out into the forgotten depths of oblivion. And all because of a disagreement about a tiny rock more than 3bn miles away. That, and the unending search for cosmic truth. A brief history of Pluto 1906 Wealthy polymath Percival Lowell speculates on the possibility of \u201cPlanet X\u201d, a ninth planet affecting the orbits of Neptune and Uranus. In 1915, his observatory unwittingly photographs Pluto, but the planet remains undiscovered and Lowell dies the following year. 1929 Self-taught junior astronomer Clyde Tombaugh is hired by the Lowell Observatory. He locates Pluto the following year, in roughly the position where Lowell thought \u201cPlanet X\u201d should be, by painstakingly comparing numerous photographs of the night sky. 1930 Eleven-year-old Oxford schoolgirl Venetia Burney suggests the new planet be named after Pluto, the elusive Roman god of the underworld. Her father conveys the suggestion to the astronomy community and the name is adopted. 1978 Charon, one of Pluto\u2019s five known moons, is discovered by James Christy of the United States Naval Observatory. The finding allows astronomers to more accurately gauge Pluto\u2019s mass, proving that it is too small to have affected the orbits of other planets. Lowell\u2019s hypothetical \u201cPlanet X\u201d is eventually declared non-existent; its proximity to the real Pluto a mere coincidence. 1992 MIT scientists Jane Luu and David Jewitt find conclusive evidence of a dense disc of celestial bodies at the edge of the solar system, now known as the Kuiper belt. Objects of a similar size and mass to Pluto, in a similar vicinity, begin to appear. 2005 A team of Caltech astronomers \u2013 led by Mike Brown - discover Eris, a celestial body in the Kuiper belt with a mass greater than Pluto\u2019s. The argument against Pluto\u2019s classification as a planet gathers momentum. 2006 In January, the New Horizons space probe is launched to study Pluto. In August, the International Astronomical Union announces its criteria for \u201cplanet\u201d status. Pluto fails to qualify, and is officially demoted to the status of \u201cdwarf planet\u201d. Scientists are divided on the matter - Alan Stern says the agreement \u201cstinks\u201d. 2008 A three-day \u201cGreat Planet Debate\u201d is held at Johns Hopkins University to decide on a more satisfactory definition of a planet. The conference reaches no firm conclusion. 2015 New Horizons reaches Pluto after nearly 10 years in space, providing some of the most arresting and detailed photographs ever taken within the solar system. 2016 Mike Brown announces that by using computer modelling he has found evidence for a \u201cPlanet Nine\u201d, which has a mass around 10 times that of Earth and an orbit 20 times further from the Sun than Neptune.

Finally, you are the principal investigator on Nasa\u2019s New Horizons mission to Pluto \u2013 that mysterious little entity, a third of the size of our moon, that is located, depending on orbital position, between 2.6bn and 4.7bn miles from Earth.</p> <p>In January 2006, your probe leaves Earth on its nine-year journey to its historic destination. It is the crowning moment of your career, a landmark project; you\u2019ve reached the peak of your profession. Then, seven months later, with your spacecraft still in the early stages of its odyssey, it is announced, following a vote at a meeting of the International Astronomy Union (IAU) in Prague, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/aug/25/starsgalaxiesandplanets.spaceexploration\">Pluto is no longer a planet</a>.</p> <p>As the consequence of the findings of an ambitious planetary astronomer, the elite group of nine planets has overnight shrunk to eight, and your mission is now heading towards a \u201cdwarf planet\u201d, just another piece of ice and rock in the vast Kuiper belt, the band of mostly small bodies that forms the perimeter, the unglamorous outer suburbs, of the solar system. That\u2019s exactly what happened to Alan Stern a decade ago. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Science isn\u2019t about voting.

Hundreds of millions of people go online to look at them. Stern is the subject of international attention, feted, apparently vindicated, a man who appears to have answered his critics about the relevance of Pluto. </p> <p>But then, out of the blue, the same astronomer whose original research prompted the demotion of Pluto announces that he\u2019s discovered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/20/ninth-planet-solar-system-edge-discovery-pluto\">evidence of Planet Nine</a>, a major planet somewhere between the size of Earth and Neptune, that could take the place of Pluto \u2013 the original ninth planet \u2013 in the known planetary system. That is exactly what Mike Brown did. </p> <p>Planetary science is a competitive field that, like any area of learning, can throw up bitter rivalries, but the stellar careers of Stern and Brown seem to be plotted along some kind of interplanetary collision course.<strong> </strong>When Brown made his announcement about Planet Nine, Stern tweeted: \u201cHype. There is no discovery.\u201d To say there is no love lost between the two scientists would be an exercise in colourless understatement.</p> <p>But their dispute is more than a clash of personalities, or even professional one-upmanship. It is about the nature of reality, how we make sense of the universe, the things in heaven and earth that are dreamt of in our philosophy.</p> <p>Stern is a small man with a big office, located in the <a href=\"http://www.boulder.swri.edu/\">Southwest Research Institute</a> in Boulder, Colorado. A neatly groomed, 58-year-old ball of energy, he is an aerospace engineer, trained pilot and very proud and angry Pluto advocate.</p> <p>Stern is proud because New Horizons, which is continuing its journey beyond Pluto into the furthest reaches of the Kuiper belt, has been a huge success and will almost certainly transform our understanding of our cosmic surroundings. He is angry because he believes Pluto has been the victim of a personal vendetta and a shady conspiracy.</p> <p>Stern rejects the IAU vote that demoted Pluto to the status of dwarf planet.</p> <p>\u201cScience isn\u2019t about voting,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t vote on the theory of relativity. We don\u2019t vote on evolution. The image of scientists voting gives the public the impression that science is arbitrary.\u201d</p> <p>As far as he is concerned, the vote was the final stage of a campaign to discredit Clyde Tombaugh, the son of Kansas farmers who, as a 24-year-old researcher, discovered Pluto in 1930.</p> <p>\u201cThere was an astronomer named Brian Marsden who for decades had a grudge against Tombaugh. He had public fights that many people observed. Tombaugh died in 1997 and Marsden went on a jihad to diminish his reputation by removing Pluto from the list of planets. He eventually found a way to do that at a convention of astronomers, a meeting with thousands of people, of which a very small fraction \u2013 4% \u2013 went to a room where the vote was taken.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f4c6f9971103ba6208f781b5cf03a83e4897f7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f4c6f9971103ba6208f781b5cf03a83e4897f7a/875_136_2908_1745/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view of Pluto\u2019s rugged, icy mountains and flat ice plains captured by Nasa\u2019s New Horizon\u2019s spacecraft\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view of Pluto\u2019s rugged, icy mountains and flat ice plains captured by Nasa\u2019s New Horizon\u2019s spacecraft.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JHUAPL/SwRI/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marsden, who was director of the IAU\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/mpc.html\">Minor Planet Center</a> in 2006, is himself dead, and it is impossible to prove or disprove Stern\u2019s allegations. But 10 years on, the decision taken that day still rankles with Stern. It annoys him that the science press didn\u2019t question the process. But what really gets to him is that the people who voted were astronomers and not, by and large, planetary scientists. He argues that they had little or no expertise in the field.</p> <p>\u201cJust as you shouldn\u2019t go to a paediatrist for brain surgery, you shouldn\u2019t go to an astronomer for expert advice on planetary science. My field is called planetary science. It involves the word planet in the name. As planetary scientists we should be able to understand what is and isn\u2019t the central object of the field. It isn\u2019t called \u2018things in space\u2019. It\u2019s called planetary science. Its about planets.\u201d</p> <p>Essentially, the IAU laid down <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU_definition_of_planet\">three criteria</a> for planetary status. The object has to be in orbit around the sun. It must have sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium, meaning it must be spherical by force of its own gravity. And it must have \u201ccleared the neighbourhood\u201d around its orbit, which is to say that it must be gravitationally dominant over surrounding objects. Pluto, the elliptical orbit of which is affected by Neptune\u2019s gravity, fails this test.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Pluto is essentially this insignificant chunk of ice that really is of no consequence in the solar system</p> <footer> <cite>Mike Brown, Brown is professor of planetary astronomy, CalTech</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Stern dismisses this criterion as too vague, arguing that it means Neptune shouldn\u2019t qualify as a planet. \u201cIf Neptune had cleared its zone,\u201d he has said, \u201cPluto wouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMike Brown and some other people who for some reason would like to manage the number of planets to be small use a location-based definition, which is about what has cleared its zone. But it\u2019s a very poor scientific concept. I\u2019ll tell you why.\u201d</p> <p>He says the criterion means the physical properties of a given object are rendered meaningless because location determines classification. \u201cIf you accept at face value the zone clearing criteria, you can write down an equation for it. That equation depends upon several things, including the mass of the star it is orbiting, its distance from the star and how old it is. The most sensitive parameter is distance. As you go outward, the clearance zone gets bigger. And as you go outward the orbit speeds get progressively slower. So it takes a more and more massive object to clear the zone as you move farther out. Which means that objects that classify as planets close to a star cannot classify as a planet far from a star.\u201d</p> <p>Stern says that if Earth was located in Pluto\u2019s position in the solar system it also wouldn\u2019t qualify as a planet. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he says. He even claims that, according to the maths, Brown\u2019s Planet Nine would not quality for planetary status, \u201cno matter how massive it is\u201d.</p> <p>Brown\u2019s response is dismissive. \u201cEarth in the Kuiper belt? That would be fascinating, but there is no Earth in the Kuiper belt. Why not? Probably because the formation of the solar system has prevented such a thing from happening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8230d5b7ce0629a82eabf81986b669c68232db22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8230d5b7ce0629a82eabf81986b669c68232db22/0_267_4578_2747/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Horizons team members count down to the spacecraft\u2019s closest approach to Pluto in July 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Horizons team members count down to the spacecraft\u2019s closest approach to Pluto in July 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bill Ingalls/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe solar system is so cleanly sorted into gravitationally dominant things (planets) and the tiny things that flit around between them (not planets), that that is telling us something truly interesting about the formation of the solar system.\u201d</p> <p>As for the notion that Planet Nine is disqualified from planetary status by the same criterion that disqualified Pluto, Brown says: \u201cThis is, of course, not true \u2013 and I\u2019m pretty sure Alan knows this. There is an elegant set of calculations by Jean-Luc Margot which attempts to put real math behind the vague \u2018cleared out the orbits\u2019 language. Planet Nine easily fulfils Margot\u2019s mathematical constraints.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the question remains, if the formation of the solar system prevented an Earth-size planet from being in the Kuiper belt, why didn\u2019t it prevent the still larger Planet Nine? The most likely theory is that, if it does exist, Planet Nine began its orbital life much closer to the sun and then crossed paths with a planet like Jupiter, which sent it spiralling into the outer reaches.</p> <p>Two more different characters than Stern and Brown it would be hard to conceive. When I visited Boulder, snow was on the ground, and there was something coiled and defensive about Stern, as if he were used to fighting for scare resources in a harsh environment.</p> <p>Brown is <a href=\"http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/\">professor of planetary astronomy</a> at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California. In Pasadena, the sun shone and the temperature was in the high 70s.</p> <p>Brown is Stern\u2019s junior by eight years, but they seem not just a generation but a whole culture apart. Brown was wearing shorts, Birkenstocks and a goatee beard when I visited his light-filled office on the Caltech campus. If the choice of epithets for the two men came down to \u201cuptight\u201d and \u201claid back\u201d, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to assign them.</p> <p>Ever since Tombaugh first discovered it, Pluto has held an uncertain position in planetary science. Initially it was thought to be roughly the mass of the Earth, owing to its presumed gravitational effect on Neptune and Uranus. But over the years that estimate was downgraded until now it is thought to be about one five-hundredth of the Earth\u2019s mass.</p> <p>In 2005, Brown discovered an object in the Kuiper belt that had greater mass than Pluto. This new body, called Eris, presented a classification problem. Either it was a 10th planet or, if it was not a planet, then neither was Pluto. Although he had always dreamed of finding a planet, Brown was inclined to the latter opinion.</p> <p>\u201cPluto,\u201d as he tells me, \u201cis essentially this insignificant chunk of ice that really is of no consequence in the solar system.\u201d</p> <p>He felt pleased when its planetary status was removed.</p> <p>\u201cIt was immensely satisfying to have the solar system described correctly for the first time. It\u2019s painful every time I see something that gives the wrong impression of reality.\u201d</p> <p>But a lot of people were sentimentally attached to the idea of Pluto and took against Brown\u2019s position. He wrote an entertaining and enlightening memoir about the experience of becoming a hate figure, entitled <em>How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming</em>.</p> <p>Stern believes the book has undermined Brown\u2019s objectivity. Interestingly, both Stern and Brown challenge each other\u2019s opinions on similar grounds. Both think the other is compromised by personal involvement, and each believes the other is responding irrationally owing to emotional reasons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a44d61b0c2ccaec48a2b224d3d76ded67475b6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a44d61b0c2ccaec48a2b224d3d76ded67475b6a/0_141_3888_2332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern, left, celebrates the New Horizons mission with colleagues Ralph Semmel, centre, and Will Grundy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern, left, celebrates the New Horizons mission with colleagues Ralph Semmel, centre, and Will Grundy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nasa/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMike\u2019s written a very successful book,\u201d Stern told me, \u201cso he\u2019s made a lot of money out of this. I don\u2019t get paid more or less depending on what I say, but he clearly does. So there\u2019s a bit of a conflict of interest. He\u2019s never going to change his mind because it will kill his book\u2019s sales.\u201d</p> <p>I checked Brown\u2019s Amazon bestseller position. His book was at 131,246 on the list \u2013 not a ranking likely to represent large or profitable sales.</p> <p>For his part, Brown says of Stern: \u201cWe should discount him. He\u2019s got a spacecraft that flew by Pluto. You kind of fall in love with the things you spend a spacecraft to. It matters to him personally that it\u2019s a planet. So ignore him.\u201d</p> <p>The two men accuse each other of suffering from nostalgia for a bygone age of certainties. In Stern\u2019s case, Brown says he wants a return to a time when Pluto was part of the canon, one of the dominant objects. Stern argues that, on the contrary, he believes in a whole new paradigm in which the solar system contains many planets \u2013 probably, be says, about 1,000. And it is Brown, he says, who is holding on to a vanishing past of few planets for fear that \u201cschoolchildren won\u2019t be able to remember their names\u201d.</p> <p>Stern reaches for a geographical analogy. \u201cWe don\u2019t limit the number of mountains or rivers of the Earth,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Brown counters with his own bit of geography. \u201cIt think it\u2019s important to us that there aren\u2019t that many planets. I think the word planet is like the word continent. There needs to be a smallish number of them. If every island was a continent, it wouldn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, he concedes, it comes down to what we want to believe. He says he asked a philosopher friend what does a word \u2013 like planet, for example \u2013 mean.</p> <p>\u201cHe said the word \u2018planet\u2019 means what people think about when they say the word \u2018planet\u2019, and I was like, \u2018Shut up!\u2019 But then I realised it\u2019s true. And the word \u2018planet\u2019 means, in our heads, a small number of large bodies in the solar system. I don\u2019t think it means everything round. It doesn\u2019t mean everything that goes round the sun.\u201d</p> <p>The official designation for Pluto, Eris, and several other objects found in the Kuiper Belt is dwarf planet. But of course, in an obvious sense, whatever we call Pluto doesn\u2019t change what it is. And what it is, according to Stern, is something of a surprise.</p> <p>\u201cNumber one surprise,\u201d he says, \u201cis that Pluto is so complex. If you plot the numbers of different kinds of geology we see on the surface, it rivals Earth and Mars. Generally, the smaller objects are simpler. Pluto is completely anomalous in that respect. And we didn\u2019t expect Pluto to be active geologically, four and half billion years after its birth. The heart-shaped region we call <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2015/jul/24/pluto-nasa-flyover-icy-plains-video\">Sputnik Planum</a> is a million square kilometres. It is the scale of the state of Texas and it was born yesterday. We can\u2019t find a single crater on it.\u201d</p> <p>To say that Pluto is an insignificant chunk of ice and rock may be true in the grand scheme of things, but meaning is not immanent in any planet or dwarf planet: it comprises what we impose on it. And Pluto is part of our history, a touchstone in our scientific journey outwards.</p> <p>There is probably no definition of the word planet that suits everyone. By Brown\u2019s understanding a planet can cease to be a planet if, for whatever reason, it changes location, while by Stern\u2019s reckoning the moon is a planet. As Brown says: \u201cDoes any scientist anywhere other than Stern think that the moon should be called a planet? I think this is the strongest argument against a geophysical definition.\u201d</p> <p>The latest research suggests that Brown\u2019s speculations about the existence of Planet Nine, based on the strange alignment of other bodies, may well be correct. If Pluto is ruled out, there have been only two planets discovered, other than by the naked eye, in human history: Uranus in 1781 and Neptune in 1846. So it would be a rare achievement to uncover a third. Brown says it is hard not to be aware of the historical significance. But Stern is having none of it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the ninth planet, right. I think it\u2019s a really insensitive terminology because it trashes Tombaugh\u2019s reputation. Either that or he\u2019s clueless. I don\u2019t know, ask him.\u201d</p> <p>I did.</p> <p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a desperate stretch,\u201d says Brown.</p> <p>And so it goes on, the two esteemed planetary scientists, circling one another like two great bodies struggling for gravitational superiority, both hoping to see the other\u2019s argument propelled out into the forgotten depths of oblivion. And all because of a disagreement about a tiny rock more than 3bn miles away. That, and the unending search for cosmic truth.</p> <h2>A brief history of Pluto</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2015/jul/24/pluto-nasa-flyover-icy-plains-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4bxty\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2343513\"            data-video-name=\"Nasa unveils Pluto's icy plains in simulated flyover \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Nasa\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-457587678\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/24/20150724Plutosicyplains_FromGuAmRM-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/24/20150724Plutosicyplains_FromGuAmRM/20150724Plutosicyplains_FromGuAmRM.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/07/24/20150724Plutosicyplains_FromGuAmRM.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/07/24/20150724Plutosicyplains_FromGuAmRM_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/07/24/20150724Plutosicyplains_FromGuAmRM_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2015/jul/24/pluto-nasa-flyover-icy-plains-video\">Nasa unveils simulated flyover of Pluto\u2019s icy plains</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>1906</strong> Wealthy polymath Percival Lowell speculates on the possibility of \u201cPlanet X\u201d, a ninth planet affecting the orbits of Neptune and Uranus.

      "bodyText": "Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, is, by all accounts, a pretty decent guitarist. The regular Glastonbury-goer is handy enough with the instrument to have braved playing in front of 5,000 colleagues at several Sainsbury\u2019s conferences. One wonders if, when he tunes up at his next gig, he\u2019ll be playing a version of Can I Change My Mind?, the 1969 hit by Tyrone Davis (who may or may not be related to Coupe\u2019s predecessor but one, Sir Peter). That track might be considered appropriate for a man who, having previously argued against the supermarket buying Argos, went and put in a bid for it anyway, once he\u2019d taken over as the grocer\u2019s front man. We\u2019re sure to hear more about that deal this week when Sainsbury\u2019s announces its results, not least because the grocery sector\u2019s lyrics are beginning to repeat as much as those on a scratched bit of vinyl. The presence of the discounters still weighs heavily on the sector \u2013 even if the majors are under less pressure of late \u2013 while among the big four there are questions about what will happen to the seemingly recovering Morrisons (also reporting this week) if Asda decides to perform again. All of which means that talk about how the Argos deal might play out is far more likely to get the City on its feet. Take it from the top, Mike. Jenkins adds value The country has been deprived of the hypnotic oratory skills of former Barclays boss Antony Jenkins for far too long \u2013 but fret not. The great man returns to the podium this week. At a House of Commons event, run by the financial-services thinktank New City Agenda, Jenkins will revisit his favoured theme of \u201cturning values into value\u201d as he explains how the only way for the banking sector to generate sustainable returns over the long term is to act \u201cat all times with good values\u201d. \u201cIn the past, banks were too aggressive, too self-serving and too focused on the short term, and these events have led to trust in the industry sinking to an all-time low,\u201d the publicity material for the event bills him as saying \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to quibble with any of that. Still, before Jenkins was a crusading chief executive of Barclays, he had been in the driving seat of the high-street part of that bank as it merrily sold payment protection insurance (PPI) to people who never needed it or could have claimed on it. Strangely, that vignette seems to have been omitted from the publicity for this week\u2019s event. Space constraints, presumably. Glaxo still not immune Protests at GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s annual meeting in London\u2019s Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II conference centre are nothing new \u2013 as anyone who owned shares during the tenure of former boss Jean-Pierre Garnier will recall. Campaigners used to gather to protest about how much JP was trousering. Investors had to squeeze past folk dressed in giant fat cat suits and others wearing T-shirts saying \u201cGreed Still Kills\u201d just to gain access to their free tea and biscuits. So maybe it\u2019s not news that there\u2019s a protest in the pipeline for Glaxo this week, when it holds its annual meeting in the usual spot, although the topic is probably more important. Shareholders are being urged to use the gathering to put pressure on Glaxo to lower the price of its life-saving pneumonia vaccines. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) has just delivered a petition to Glaxo (and another to rival Pfizer) asking that the vaccine prices be cut to $5 for each child in developing countries. Glaxo says it has lowered the price it charges Gavi, the non-profit vaccine alliance operating in a small number of countries, to $3.05 from next year, just covering its cost. But Greg Elder of MSF asks: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of a life-saving vaccine if the most vulnerable people can\u2019t afford it?\u201d Developing...",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley should send a bottle of bubbly to Sir Philip Green. The Sports Direct founder\u2019s attempt to dodge a grilling by MPs almost seems a sideshow when there are bigger fish to fry. Two select committees \u2013 work and pensions; and business, innovation and skills \u2013 want to hear from the BHS bogeyman and have invited him to a joint session on a day of his choosing in the next few weeks. Green, unlike Ashley, will be up for the fight, one suspects. He loves the spotlight, feels his arguments aren\u2019t being heard and may fear a consumer backlash against his Arcadia interests, notably Topshop. A refusal to attend would simply guarantee another verbal battering for a tycoon already branded the new \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d by one Tory MP. But a word of advice for committee members: please do not compete to see who can provoke Green to the greatest level of fury. That game may guarantee top billing on the News at Ten, but it is too easy to play. The BHS debacle requires forensic blow-by-blow questioning about the process by which Green extracted \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments from the business over the years, even as the deficit in the pension fund grew larger. We also need to know how he came to think a bunch of retailing amateurs led by a twice-bankrupt individual would be a suitable buyer of BHS, complete with those daunting pension liabilities. Here are a few questions to get the MPs started. BHS paid dividends of \u00a3423m between 2002 and 2004, but why did Green not divert some of that cash into a pension fund that was already heading into deficit towards the end of the period? What evidence can he provide that sale-and-leaseback property deals between BHS and the members of the Green family were conducted at arm\u2019s length and on commercial terms? Similarly, how were fees calculated when BHS bought services from the wider Arcadia group? In 2012, the company and the pension fund agreed to close the deficit in the pension fund over 23 years. Why was such a long period deemed sensible? How was Green introduced to Dominic Chappell, the former racing driver who headed the Retail Acquisitions consortium that bought BHS for \u00a31 in 2015? Why did Green regard him as a fit and proper owner? Why did he not seek approval from the Pensions Regulator for the transfer of the business? What discussions did he have with trustees of the BHS pension at that time? What contact did he have with Chappell\u2019s consortium after the sale? It has been reported that Green made an offer of \u00a380m \u2013 half in cash, half in the write-off of a loan \u2013 to top up the pension fund after the failure of BHS. Did he make that offer and, if so, why? What was the basis of the calculation? The MPs must do their homework because Green will have done his. Indeed, it might be wise to borrow a trick from Andrew Tyrie \u2013 the chairman of the Treasury select committee and a veteran in the art of cross-examining slippery bankers \u2013 and hire a QC to fire some detailed questions. Of course, the session should not be confined to gathering facts. There is a basic question of morality at stake: what responsibilities does Green feel towards 11,000 BHS staff and 20,000 pensioners? He owned the business for 15 years, and paid his wife fat dividends, yet sold BHS in an enfeebled state to a buyer lacking retail experience. Whatever the legality of his business manoeuvres, doesn\u2019t he feel a duty to ensure BHS pensioners get every last penny of what they expected in their retirement? If Green can\u2019t accept the moral case for writing a large cheque to close the \u00a3571m deficit, he will deserve every last drop of the MPs\u2019 \u2013 and the public\u2019s \u2013 scorn. It would be a shabby finale to a business career, but Green has a choice: does he want he seen as a decent man or as a shameless chancer? So Europe\u2019s not doing so badly after all\u2026 The eurozone economy was bubbling in the first three months of the year. Never since the 2008 crisis has it expanded by 0.6% in a single quarter \u2013 2.4% if extrapolated over the year. Such is the pace of growth that the 19-member bloc outstripped the UK and the US. UK growth was just 0.4% in the first three months, and statisticians in Washington said the US had flatlined. And this comes after GDP increased steadily for 18 months, putting a smile on the faces of tired eurocrats more accustomed to dealing with Greek debt or the refugee crisis. Even France was near the head of the pack. Its economy grew 0.5%, beating economists\u2019 expectations and boosting the fortunes of socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who will stand for re-election next year. So much for Europe\u2019s reputation as a bombed-out economic has-been. And yet there was talk of a false dawn, in part because unemployment remains in double figures and inflation dropped from zero to -0.2%. And just as US figures for the early part of the year are often upgraded, the eurozone\u2019s are often later downgraded. Another barrier to a more sustained recovery is the slowdown in global growth recently documented by the IMF. Japan and China are struggling to maintain the export-driven growth that has served them so well, and Brazil and Russia are coping with recession. No wonder the Brussels elite want the UK to stay. They have avoided a crisis for almost two years and seen the benefits. Britain leaving would bring the EU\u2019s brief period of benign expansion to a halt and worse, if the many economists who predict gloom for Europe following a Brexit are to be believed. They fear is not just political instability, but a collapse in trade and investment akin to the 2008 crash. The OECD said last week that financial markets were already increasing the insurance premiums they charged to hedge against the worst possible outcomes, raising the costs of trade. Brussels knows how ugly family crises can get and wants to avoid another. Time is tight at RBS Running bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland was never going to be an easy gig. But for Ross McEwan, at the helm since October 2013, it just got harder. On Friday, the market reacted badly to the idea that the bank will not be able to resume dividend payments until 2018 \u2013 a decade after shareholders last received a share of the spoils. The delay to payouts is one problem caused by the botched job of carving out the Williams &amp; Glyn network as demanded by Brussels at the time of the bailout. McEwan cannot be expected to take all the blame for what one analyst has rightly described as a farcical situation, but it is definitely his problem now. He has spoken vaguely of alternatives. Vagueness will not be tolerated for long. The City\u2019s patience is wearing thin and the European commission is unlikely to look kindly on an already extended deadline being missed.",

We\u2019ve seen exhaustive inquiries, prosecutions, verdicts of guilt or innocence. It\u2019s mostly over for everyone but the Bun. Even Hacked Off may grow weary soon.

Labour would lob the Shrewsbury 24 into the same pot, plus the stinking south London failure to track down the killers of Daniel Morgan (investigator of police corruption). But in fact the charge sheet stretches on and on, from Stephen Lawrence to Jean Charles de Menezes: deaths, botches, dissemblings.

Of course newspapers have a lot to answer for. The Sun has been tarred and feathered for its first version of Hillsborough \u201cjustice\u201d.

Rather, it sheds a bleak, grey light on much of the coverage of 27 years ago.

Police inquiries will always stumble from time to time. That\u2019s in the nature of the job. But acknowledging the stumble is part of the job \u2013 from Hillsborough to Operation Midland. Elizabeth Filkin was fastest off the mark after phone hacking, with a report that sought to sanitise police behaviour by cutting off all but formal media contacts. That looked like a mistake then and looks like one now. Hillsborough, and an initially complaisant press, saw South Yorkshire police in its own cocoon of lies. Filkin custom weaves more cocoons \u2013 believing that press contagion infects the police. Construct a cordon sanitaire of silence around the boys in blue. But what if, often, that\u2019s the wrong way around? What if whistleblowers are blown away or, worse, in prison? What if separation makes things worse? If Leveson 2 could centre on victims of injustice and what Andy Burnham calls their \u201cfight for truth\u201d, that might be reason to reconvene and see what a constantly moving finger writes.

He\u2019s only here to help. So in Whitehall eyes, big is beautiful. Big bucks, big clout. And here\u2019s the moment for a quick voyage around last week\u2019s media scene. In America, the biggest newspaper chain \u2013 Gannett \u2013 launched a hostile $815m takeover bid for the (LA, Chicago, Baltimore and more) Tribune Group. What\u2019s the plan? Probably to fill up Tribune pages with imported stuff from Gannett\u2019s USA Today, so cutting down on local coverage, and letting the magic of extra cost-cutting rule OK.

The Gray Lady may be extending its global reach, but via New York and Hong Kong hubs. Big consolidations; small fry axed. And in London, the managing editor of the FT writes a note to staff. \u201cWe are facing some daunting trading conditions in 2016,\u201d he tells them (before they tell Politico). Print advertising has made a bad start to the year: digital isn\u2019t fulfilling any high hopes. Commercial management is \u201cbraced for tough times ahead\u201d. Just like national newspaper managements in general, who only need to look at the Advertising Association\u2019s statistical report for 2015 to know that they\u2019re not alone. In one sense, ad agencies had a happy year. The total British market was up 7.5% to \u00a320.1bn. TV ads grew 7.3% to \u00a35.2bn. Internet advertising was 17.3% up at \u00a38.6bn. But newspapers? Regionals 6.2% down to \u00a31.17bn; nationals down by \u00a3155.4m on 2014 (that\u2019s a 9.6% drop for broadsheets and a 16.2% fall for the rest of the market). Tough pounding. But who, pray, is getting the fattest slices of this diminishing cake? Think big again. \u201cBig\u201d newspapers such as the Sun are in the firing line. Big TV companies are having to strive and spend harder as audiences begin a long-term decline (dipping grimly in April). Even Murdoch sees dragons gathering (watch the US TV sports market falter). The biggest, most muscular beneficiaries of so much struggle are our new chums Google and Facebook (adding unexpected billions to revenue last week). The spoils of news competition go increasingly not to news providers, but to the aggregators and platforms of social media. They dominate thinking today. They control the fate of smaller digital operations, able to feed or starve them at a flick of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s finger. They can move into video, TV, movie-making and newsgathering as they wish. They pay only such taxes as they deem necessary for public relations. They are the smile on the face of a tiger.

Does he hope somehow to fund creativity and diversity by losing the channel we have in some giant maw \u2013 and, non-coincidentally, making the BBC much smaller as he chops away with his other hand? It\u2019s a crazy, dissonant policy, haplessly pursued. And a big mistake. \u25a0 Priti Patel versus Sajid Javid. Penny Mordaunt versus Theresa May. The inevitable Gove against the unavoidable Ken Clarke. The so-on and so-forth of Leave and Remain debate clashes stretches over weeks and months yet. But there is one crucial contest that hasn\u2019t been scheduled (though it\u2019s waged day after day on pink and white sheets): Lionel Barber, editor of the Financial Times, in a Newsnight or Today studio, taking on Paul Dacre of the Mail.

      "bodyText": "Futuristic R&amp;B is becoming something of a hegemonic sound, not to mention an overcrowded marketplace. Once reserved for arty margin dwellers such as Kelela and the recherche FKA twigs, this highly processed variant of mainstream R&amp;B has become the defining innovation of this decade, with ranks of young women signing up to coo ecstasies over glacial machine work. Into this fraught soundscape comes 27-year-old London newcomer Nao, sweet voiced, but something of a force to be reckoned with, too. She was nominated for best newcomer at the Mobos and placed third on the BBC\u2019s Sound of 2016 list, well above Dua Lipa, her most obvious fellow traveller in the class of this year. Collaborations with Disclosure (Nao sang Superego on their last album, Caracal), and fellow Sound of 2016 anointee Mura Masa (on the track Firefly) have displayed Nao\u2019s versatility and nous; her song Zillionaire found its way into a Samsung ad. Crucially, though, on none of these tracks has Nao sounded like a mere disembodied voice for hire \u2013 a constant risk for vocalists. Live, there\u2019s quite a bit more to set Nao apart from the FR&amp;B sorority. At first tonight, she is all arms, a recurrent motif of her early release artwork. Lit from the back, fronting a live band with real instruments, she makes like a Hindu goddess as the fingersnaps and synth rushes of her first track, We Don\u2019t Give a\u2026 resolve into a heavy take on a pop tune. This is future R&amp;B, yes, but with a few twists. The veteran of years of backing vocal session work and a four-year jazz degree, Nao\u2019s childhood was allegedly spent absorbing everything her older siblings and mother played (which is to say, most music). You can hear it in her confidence and restraint. Her eagerly awaited debut album is due out in early summer, Nao reveals later tonight, a gig that closes her appetite-whetting European tour. Hopefully, it will make hay of her strong suits. Nao\u2019s great gift is carefully restoring future R&amp;B\u2019s past to it. She has the elastic voice \u2013 and the augmented-reality vocal processing \u2013 to cut it as an edgy digital minx, but lashings of distorted funk in her tunes. Songs such as Inhale Exhale from last year\u2019s February 15 EP) combine crunchy, stop-start rhythms with a thoroughly disreputable bassline. Nao\u2019s singing is easy and versatile, keeping back the melismas of which she is obviously capable, playing up the natural helium edge to her voice and accessorising it with a few canned backing vocals. A pattern soon emerges, of edgy detailing embellishing strong songs. Good Girl, which dates from 2014, is another tried and tested goer, one that combines giddy layered vocals with very-now percolating synths. Although it\u2019s aerated, it\u2019s not all that abstract. This is a kiss-off to a bad relationship, in which both parties probably expected too much from the start. \u201cHe wanted me silent/ I wanted to scream,\u201d Nao sings cuttingly. An early song, So Good \u2013 produced by AK Paul, brother of mysterious producer Jai Paul \u2013 is dedicated to Prince, an obvious touchstone. It\u2019s one of Nao\u2019s subtler moments; some of its nuance is lost in the tumult of a live band. Her Prince references don\u2019t stop there. A newer song, Girlfriend (sample line: \u201cIf I was your girlfriend\u201d) is a sneak peek ahead at the album \u2013 a great slab of digital funk, heavy with beats that threaten to teeter dizzyingly off the time signature. It erupts to a climax of wavy arms, saturated back lighting and a band at full pelt \u2013 the equal of Nao\u2019s greatest moment so far, her Bad Blood single, which comes as an encore. Not to be confused with the Taylor Swift track, Nao\u2019s Bad Blood starts all minimal and angelic. Nao\u2019s voice plunges suddenly, a rug-from-underfoot moment that finds the crowd erupting in whoops as a head-banging funk rhythm arrives. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me I\u2019m cuckoo,\u201d she sings, deconstructing the syllables of \u201ccuckoo\u201d. Not everything Nao plays tonight grabs you as compulsively as these surprisingly muscular digital songs in which love goes badly wrong. There are times when she becomes a little too mild mannered, particularly on the blander love songs such as It\u2019s You. But the evidence is mounting that Nao might be rather good, as well as merely tipped by those invested in her.",

      "bodyText": "In a pair of new TV documentaries, Going Going Gone, the film-maker Nick Broomfield visits two rotting and boarded-up relics of Britain\u2019s 19th-century industrial wealth. One is the baroque-style Coal Exchange in Cardiff, the other the neoclassical Wellington Rooms in Liverpool. Both were created for moneyed classes \u2013 in the decades of Cardiff\u2019s coal boom, traders in the exchange set the world\u2019s price for the commodity; in the Wellington Rooms people made rich by slavery and shipping danced and partied. But both later became popular venues for the less privileged and ethnically mixed communities in which they stood. The Wellington Rooms were an Irish Centre until the late 1990s; the Coal Exchange was a venue for weddings, parties and concerts until its closure in 2013. The films are shot in Broomfield\u2019s distinctive style, in which he himself is a conspicuous presence, sometimes wielding a sound boom, sometimes pleading with unhelpful security staff as the rain falls on his clear plastic&nbsp;mac. The subjects of your best-known films include prostitution, Sarah Palin, Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love, and the Iraq war, rather than architecture. What moved you to make films about these buildings? They\u2019re planned to be the first in a longer series about regeneration, though both these buildings are very lovely. Fifty years ago when I was a student in Cardiff the Coal Exchange was a favourite of mine. I just thought it was incredible, but now it is badly abused. And then in 1969 I made my first film, Who Cares, about the destruction of streets and communities in the Abercromby district of Liverpool, where the Wellington Rooms still stand. It is heartbreaking to see the way the rain comes into the building now. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by buildings and history; it\u2019s what I spend so much of my time doing anyway, so I might as well make films about it. When I travel I always make a point of finding out about the history of a place, its iconic buildings, knowing why it is the way it is. At the moment I am living in Los Angeles and it also has the most amazing history. What started your interest in architectural and industrial heritage that is evident in Who Cares? My father was an industrial photographer, and I occasionally went off with him when he was working. I grew up in rather middle-class Highgate but I became aware through him of other places, industrial places. My grandfather was an architect in Czechoslovakia. He was a great believer in urban renewal, in knocking down old houses and building tower blocks. He was a 1930s socialist so believed in providing the best things for the working classes, but it was a bit of a condescending attitude. I was so close to him but we had the biggest arguments. Then at 18 or 19 I went to university in Cardiff and I lived in the Butetown area, which is where the Coal Exchange is. I became fascinated and fell in love with it. I met amazing people, welcoming and inclusive. The beauty of it was that it had 40 races living together, Hindus, Catholics, Muslims, Jews. There was always a party there, with one religious festival or another. It was the best education in the world for kids, who of course were completely non-judgmental. And the people were also incredibly beautiful. It had the most successful racial integration in the UK and it was completely destroyed. You can see what it was like in a film made by someone who lived there, Malcolm Capener, called Tiger Bay and the Rainbow Club. Do you think the general public are always interested in heritage, or is it something that comes and goes? Heritage is a constant, a touchstone for people\u2019s history. The British are very concerned with it, passionate about it. It\u2019s interesting to make films about it because people can get so&nbsp;emotional. In the 1960s a lot of historic buildings were destroyed after which there was a reaction and a higher level of protection. It\u2019s interesting that you\u2019re going back to the subject now. Does this mean that they are once again threatened? It\u2019s something dictated by the financial markets. In the richer areas there\u2019s better protection. In London you get a lot of interest but in other parts of Britain where the economy is not so strong there is less scrutiny of what\u2019s happening. If Butetown and its docks had been in London they would have been enormous, the most attractive and chic-est place to live. In Cardiff they filled them in. Is it just about money, or attitudes? I think it\u2019s in the head. It is so much to do with the imagination of planners. I talked to people at Cardiff council and they have a lot of embarrassment about the coal industry and the history of coal, because it led to disease and exploitation. They\u2019re correct about that, but until people embrace their past they\u2019re stuck in no man\u2019s land. They\u2019re denying their industry and also their culture and past. In Going Going Gone you include people with memories of the buildings when they were still in use: an Afro-Caribbean woman who celebrated her golden wedding in the Exchange, an Irish Liverpudlian couple who fell in love at first sight in the Wellington Rooms. It\u2019s obviously important to you to show something of the lives lived in them. These buildings were built by the elite with no expense spared, but then became buildings of the people and people have a right to have a say in them. If you live in a democracy part of urban renewal should be that the public participate. Are you hopeful that these buildings will be saved? In terms of short-term gain the easiest thing is to knock buildings down but I am hopeful with both \u2013 they are dying to be made into something special. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late to save the historical area of Cardiff. There\u2019s a plan for a luxury hotel in the Coal Exchange that might not be perfect, but it will attract other money and the place will kick off. The style of the films seems simple and direct, with a small crew. It\u2019s pretty straightforward. It\u2019s also a bit of an experiment. I don\u2019t think we even broke even on the budget. But I should give credit to the BBC. It is the last place where important experimental films are still done, probably in the world and certainly in Britain. They make a point of doing things that other channels aren\u2019t prepared to do. Going Going Gone: Nick Broomfield\u2019s Disappearing Britain is on BBC4 later&nbsp;this month",

You can see what it was like in a film made by someone who lived there, Malcolm Capener, called <a href=\"http://player.bfi.org.uk/film/watch-tiger-bay-and-the-rainbow-club-i-1960/\" title=\"\"><em>Tiger Bay and the Rainbow Club</em></a>.</p> <p><strong>Do you think the general public are always interested in heritage, or is it something that comes and goes?</strong><br />Heritage is a constant, a touchstone for people\u2019s history. The British are very concerned with it, passionate about it. It\u2019s interesting to make films about it because people can get so\u00a0emotional.</p> <p>In the 1960s a lot of historic buildings were destroyed after which there was a reaction and a higher level of protection.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s interesting that you\u2019re going back to the subject now. Does this mean that they are once again threatened?</strong><br />It\u2019s something dictated by the financial markets. In the richer areas there\u2019s better protection. In London you get a lot of interest but in other parts of Britain where the economy is not so strong there is less scrutiny of what\u2019s happening. If Butetown and its docks had been in London they would have been enormous, the most attractive and chic-est place to live. In Cardiff they filled them in.</p> <p><strong>Is it just about money, or attitudes?</strong><br />I think it\u2019s in the head. It is so much to do with the imagination of planners. I talked to people at Cardiff council and they have a lot of embarrassment about the coal industry and the history of coal, because it led to disease and exploitation. They\u2019re correct about that, but until people embrace their past they\u2019re stuck in no man\u2019s land. They\u2019re denying their industry and also their culture and past.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/01/tales-of-the-grim-sleeper-nick-broomfield-lonnie-franklin-jr\">Tales of the Grim Sleeper \u2013 Nick Broomfield\u2019s salutary serial-killer documentary</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>In <em>Going Going Gone</em> you include people with memories of the buildings when they were still in use: an Afro-Caribbean woman who celebrated her golden wedding in the Exchange, an Irish Liverpudlian couple who fell in love at first sight in the Wellington Rooms.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late to save the historical area of Cardiff.

It\u2019s also a bit of an experiment. I don\u2019t think we even broke even on the budget. But I should give credit to the BBC. It is the last place where important experimental films are still done, probably in the world and certainly in Britain.

      "bodyText": "This is an intriguing, well-written debut novel full of adventure, extraordinary places and wildly magical characters. Although the novel begins somewhat slowly, the pace soon picks up and readers are taken on a thrilling and unpredictable journey along the river Dan\u00e9k, with our hero, Wulliam, and the colourful characters who come to share his boat. Despite a somewhat rushed climax and some gratuitous blood and gore, Riverkeep demands a sequel! Wulliam is nearly sixteen, and about to reluctantly take on his father\u2019s role as the Riverkeep, a guardian of the river Dan\u00e9k who prevents the river from freezing over in winter and who pulls corpses from its murky depths. While readers find out a little about the role of the Riverkeep from Wull, we continue to find out even more via extracts taken from the Riverkeep\u2019s log and other documents, supplied at the beginning of each chapter. This is a delightfully peculiar addition to the novel. When his father is attacked by a mysterious creature and becomes a shadow of his former self, Wulliam sets out to find the Mormorach, a magical beast whose body is rumoured to hold the cure to his father\u2019s mysterious malady\u2026 The central characters in Riverkeep are vivid, magical and strange. From Remedie Cantwell, a witch with a child made of wood whom she believes can be brought to life, to Mix, a young stowaway with strange markings around her neck, to Tillinghast, a brazen and cheeky homunculus carrying a stolen mandrake, each of the people who come to share Wull\u2019s boat have their own extraordinary story and they are all brilliantly described. Wulliam is a complex character, touchingly devoted to his sick father, with whom he has spent a mostly solitary existence. I enjoyed seeing Wull developing as a character over the course of the novel, becoming less na\u00efve, more confident and much more reckless. While Tillinghast was mildly annoying at times, the debate that the characters have about the nature of what constitutes \u201clife\u201d and the way Tillinghast clearly struggled to find out who and what he was were really original and interesting, giving the \u201cadventure\u201d narrative another dimension. Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed at the lack of explanation or even an ending to either Remedie or Mix\u2019s stories. I felt like these characters were forgotten as the novel raced towards an action-packed finale, which is why I am hoping there will be a sequel to provide closure and explanation! Readers are never told where Mix is from, where she is going or who the \u201cscary people\u201d chasing her are. What\u2019s more, the events featuring Tillinghast that lead up to the final chapter were extremely confusing and rushed \u2013 the reader is not given any time to draw their own conclusions and figure out what\u2019s going on. The entire conclusion sequence is incredibly rushed. Half of the action in the novel seems to take place over about three pages and some aspects of it seemed to make very little sense. If, like me, you have picked up this book because it was described as \u201cperfect for fans of Patrick Ness\u201d you may have to be patient through the first 100 pages or so, because it is somewhat slow. The seven-page-long conversation with the undertaker, who never appears again, was particularly dull for me; I think it was added for comic effect but I found it lacking in humour and full of overly gory description. There are many other supporting characters who don\u2019t really seem to belong in the story. However, you should persist, because it soon becomes a gripping and interesting read! For my taste, there\u2019s too much gratuitous gore \u2013 in almost every chapter the flow of the story is interrupted by something unpleasant involving maggots or intestines! Then again, I\u2019ve never been a fan of blood and gore in books or films, so this is something that probably won\u2019t matter to everyone. Despite my reservations, Riverkeep is an enjoyable adventure through a dazzlingly well-imagined setting. Stewart\u2019s writing perfectly captures the dangerous journey, the mysterious landscape and the characters who journey through it. I would recommend it to fans of fantasy and adventure. It may be flawed but it\u2019s still left me wanting more and I\u2019ve never read anything quite like it. Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop Want to tell the world about a book you\u2019ve read?

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ever since his first written evidence to the Treasury committee, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has hinted that he understands the UK\u2019s real deficit problem. This is not the budget deficit, of which chancellor Osborne has made such a fetish, but the balance of payments deficit. Indeed, that distinguished former permanent secretary to the Treasury and cabinet secretary, Lord Turnbull, recently pointed out that debt owed to citizens of this country is not a problem \u2013 and that by not borrowing more for infrastructure at such low rates, Osborne is actually impoverishing future generations. He is, said Turnbull, \u201cplaying a dirty game\u201d. On the real deficit problem, it is obvious from his various pronouncements that Carney can, for a central bank governor, be quite relaxed about a fall \u2013 let us call it an \u201cadjustment\u201d \u2013 in the foreign exchange value of the currency if it is necessary to restore, or at least prevent a further deterioration, in Britain\u2019s competitiveness in international trade. Thus it emerged last week that the governor had written to Andrew Tyrie, the chairman of the Treasury committee, explaining that a 10% fall in the pound would boost economic growth by reducing the price of exports (or making exports more profitable) and encouraging companies and private individuals to buy more domestically manufactured goods. And the impact on inflation \u2013 which is already well below the official target \u2013 would hardly be sensational. But he distinguished between the effects of such a depreciation arising \u201cfor no underlying reason\u201d and a run on sterling that might result from a vote to leave the European Union \u2013 commonly known as \u201cBrexit\u201d. He explained: \u201cIf increased uncertainty were a key underlying cause of this depreciation, aggregate demand might be affected.\u201d Firms might postpone investment projects and households defer spending. Well, to judge from recent figures for gross domestic product in general and retail sales in particular, the economy may already be affected by concerns about the outcome of the referendum. These are deep waters, because our sensationally bad balance of payments position suggests that a major devaluation of the pound is needed anyway. I do not know whether Carney has read my good friend Sir Douglas Wass\u2019s magisterial work on the 1976 sterling crisis, Decline to Fall, but I assume he worries that a necessary devaluation could get completely out of hand \u2013 as happened in 1976, when the balance of payments position was not nearly as bad as it is now, although inflation certainly was. The Daily Telegraph columnist Roger Bootle, of Capital Economics, and the Labour donor John Mills recently produced a \u201cwork in progress\u201d pamphlet which argues that the kind of devaluation that might ensue from Brexit would be just what the economic doctor ordered anyway, whatever one\u2019s position on the Brexit debate. Bootle is deeply Eurosceptical, and Mills is of the Leave persuasion. Likewise, the economist Christopher Smallwood, who chaired a discussion of the pamphlet, thinks that for this reason a panic about Brexit could have unintended good consequences. All this comes with the proviso that the pound, unlike Hemingway\u2019s sun, does not also rise. For one of the problems with the fashion for a complete lack of exchange-rate management these days is that a necessary devaluation, as occurred in 2008-09, does not necessarily last. The result is that there is too much uncertainty for business to make long-term investment decisions. I seem to be one of the few who contend that the management of the world economy would benefit from international coordination to limit wild swings in the exchange rates that have such an influence on investment decisions. Indeed, when I wrote about this some years ago, I received a letter from that great former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker, saying that he and I appeared to be the only people in the world who approved of \u201ctarget zones\u201d for managing the gyrations of exchange rates. It is indeed unfortunate that, given our freedom from the fixed exchange-rate regime of the eurozone \u2013 one of the best British macroeconomic policy decisions of recent decades \u2013 our policymakers have made such a mess of exchange-rate management. Talking of which, I was much struck at a recent Llewellyn Consulting seminar by a presentation on Brexit from John Nug\u00e9e, who, when at the Bank of England, spent some time at the coal face of foreign exchange reserve management. Nug\u00e9e said we were in the world of \u201csurvival analysis\u201d, recalling that great Bank governor Eddie George\u2019s wise dictum: \u201cIt is never worth risking what you cannot afford to lose in order to win what you do not need to have.\u201d Personally, I think the calling of the referendum signified a colossal failure of leadership by David Cameron. It is suggested he was hoping that being in coalition with the Liberals would mean never having to follow through on his pledge. But because his promise to hold one saw off the threat from Ukip, it guaranteed the coalition would not be renewed in 2015 \u2013 and therefore meant he was still on the hook. And if he thought the referendum would heal the huge rift over Europe in the Conservative party, the inside view is that he has another think coming.",

But because his promise to hold one saw off the threat from Ukip, it guaranteed the coalition would not be renewed in 2015 \u2013 and therefore meant he was still on the hook.</p> <p>And if he thought the referendum would heal the huge rift over Europe in the Conservative party, the inside view is that he has another think coming.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you were dropped into the middle of a conversation with Alan Cumming, this is how it might flow: \u201cYou know Geraldine James? Every time we see her\u2026 what\u2019s that movie she\u2019s in? 45 Years! With Charlotte Rampling \u2013 so nice to see a movie where they don\u2019t cut back and forth all the time, and you get to watch people rather than being bombarded. Anyway, every time we see Geraldine James we go: \u2018Would you like a bacon sandwich?\u2019, because years ago I saw The Jewel in the Crown, and there\u2019s a bit where she\u2019s just had an affair with someone, and she comes out the next morning and says: \u2018Would you like a bacon sandwich?\u2019\u201d He chuckles. \u201cI\u2019ve always had shorthand ways to remind Grant [Cumming\u2019s husband] who people are, and she\u2019s Bacon Sandwich,\u201d he explains, before dashing on. \u201cThere are some hilarious ones\u2026 who was I doing the other day? He\u2019s British, said he didn\u2019t like Madonna, and told a story about getting peed on.\u201d I never do find out who was peed on because Cumming is rhapsodising on the vegan butcher he visited in Minnesota while touring his Sappy Songs roadshow. \u201cThey had this Porterhouse steak and I got some Canadian ham, and there\u2019s these Korean spare ribs, delicious \u2013 they\u2019ve got a slightly chewy texture.\u201d Talking to Cumming is like being inside his head, a fizzing ball of enquiry ping-ponging from subject to subject \u2013 his ardent support for Bernie Sanders, the time he was replaced in a sci-fi movie by Dame Judi Dench (\u201cI said: \u2018That bitch is always getting my roles\u2019\u201d), and why he only accepted a career-changing part in The Good Wife \u201cabsolutely under duress\u201d. It\u2019s a quality that helped make his 2014 memoir Not My Father\u2019s Son oddly exhilarating in spite of its poignant tale of a merciless, philandering father so bent on tormenting his sons that Cumming has \u201cnot one memory from our childhoods that is not clouded by fear or humiliation or pain\u201d. He writes like he talks, in a no-holds-barred rush of observation and confession. It\u2019s why he enjoys touring the country singing, because for once he\u2019s not acting. \u201cI love the connection you get with the audience. There\u2019s nothing like it.\u201d He rolls up his sleeve to reveal a tattoo on his arm of EM Forster\u2019s famous line from Howard\u2019s End: \u201cOnly Connect.\u201d Sometimes he\u2019ll grab a phone or camera from someone in the audience and delete what they\u2019ve been recording, because that\u2019s not connection. \u201cOf course you\u2019re going to record me and take a photo when I\u2019m doing a concert. But don\u2019t be sitting a metre away from me, holding your arm like that\u2026\u201d He mimes a camera in his face. \u201cI had this epiphany,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t have to take my photo with everybody who asks. When you\u2019re picking up your dog\u2019s poop and someone says: \u2018Can I have a photo?\u2019 and I say: \u2018I have shit in my hands\u2019 and they go: \u2018Oh, once you put it in the bin, can I have a photo?\u2019 I will say no.\u201d He says Americans sometimes seemed shocked by his frankness, but frankness is part of his appeal. He once took a neon pen to the wall of his London flat and wrote out Roosevelt\u2019s Depression-era mantra \u201cThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\u201d a principle he seems determined to live by. There is one particularly vivid scene in Not My Father\u2019s Son in which the 13-year-old Cumming buys a dinner service from a stand at the Angus Show in Arbroath. It is cold and damp, as it often is in Scotland, and his father has disappeared with a woman he has accidentally on purpose run into. Alone, shivering in the smirr, Cumming bids for the crockery. It is \u201cbeige and bland with 70s-style flowers printed on every plate, bowl and cup,\u201d but to the young boy it represents escape. \u201cI would be eating off them in a place where there were buses and taxis and where I would never have to wait in a public place for hours, cold and damp, wondering if my father had concluded his liaison.\u201d That dinner service, or pieces of it, survived for many years, until Cumming moved to New York and the promise it embodied was well and truly met. This summer he will perform at the Festival in Edinburgh, the city where it all began for him 32 years ago as one half of the trendy Kelvinside thespians Victor &amp; Barry (Forbes Masson played Victor). But first there\u2019s a movie to film, After Louie, more concert dates, another book to complete (You\u2019ve Got to Get Bigger Dreams) and the small matter of an iconic TV series to wrap up. On 1 January 2010, Alan Cumming made his New Year\u2019s resolutions. \u201cOne of them was to wear more suits,\u201d he recalls. A week later he was offered the role of Eli Gold, the strait-laced political strategist on The Good Wife, then in its first season. \u201cI was like: \u2018What? You\u2019re casting me?\u201d recalls Cumming. \u201cI\u2019d never really played a human being before, much less a middle-aged man in a suit.\u201d It\u2019s safe to say that Cumming was probably not the only one to puzzle over the casting director\u2019s instincts. He\u2019d rocketed to fame in the US in Sam Mendes\u2019s 1998 Broadway revival of Cabaret, playing the emcee \u2013 a \u201csemi-clad sexy pixie that was sexually ambiguous, and European, and weird,\u201d in Cumming\u2019s words. The performance won him a Tony, and the roles that followed were a grab bag of hits and misses that played on his outsized personality, from a comic villain in Spy Kids to the voice of Persnikitty in Garfield: The Movie, and Gutsy Smurf in The Smurfs. Evidently European, weird, and sexually ambiguous was fertile ground for Cumming. The Good Wife, a sophisticated courtroom drama, was different. Loosely inspired by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general forced out of office by a sex scandal in March 2008, it follows the career of a disgraced politician\u2019s wife, Alicia Florrick played by Julianna Margulies, as she rebuilds her life. Eli Gold is the blustering Machiavellian fixer who connives to resurrect the political career of her husband, Peter Florrick. Ever since its premiere in 2009, The Good Wife has been celebrated as a paragon of network television, mostly for not resembling network television \u2013 the shows of which can be predictable, simplistic, safe. The Good Wife, by contrast, is complex, compelling, casually cynical at a time when there\u2019s much to be cynical about. But in January 2010 Cumming was not convinced the show would survive the ruthless economies of the slash-and-burn networks. And he had Burlesque to film with Cher. A one-episode gig with a CBS legal soap didn\u2019t cut it, so he turned it down. His agents pushed him to reconsider. \u201cThey said: \u2018We really think this could be good for you \u2013 they might ask you to do more,\u2019\u201d Cumming recalls. Grudgingly he relented. It may have been the smartest about-turn he will ever make. One episode led to another, and then another, and before long he was a \u201cseries regular\u201d, as they say in the trade, often stealing the best lines of the show. The Good Wife not only beamed him into the living rooms of America, it earned him two Emmy nominations in five seasons. Cumming joined a rich ensemble that included old pros such as Christine Baranksi, Michael J Fox and Stockard Channing, but also some talented newcomers like Archie Panjabi and Mamie Gummer. \u201cI always think that\u2019s why you pay your agents and managers all that money,\u201d he muses. \u201cBecause sometimes they give really good advice.\u201d But The Good Wife is ending, after seven seasons. Cumming has appeared in all of them. The upcoming finale, which will be shown on 8 May, has fans in suspense as 157 episodes of history catch up with Alicia Florrick and her husband. When I tell Cumming I\u2019m devastated by the impending absence in my life, he scoffs. \u201cYou\u2019ll get over it.\u201d He\u2019s right, of course \u2013 it\u2019s just television. And yet great television leaves a void in its wake. Like The Sopranos, which it resembles in several key ways, the writers have invested as much energy in character studies as in plot development. We\u2019ve come to know these people onscreen in ways that feel intimate. We\u2019ll miss them. Like The Sopranos, too, The Good Wife is morally ambivalent, a harder ground to occupy in network TV, which tends to be didactic. \u201cWhy I think it\u2019s popular, and why I think it\u2019s so good, and why I\u2019m really proud to be in it, is that it doesn\u2019t tell you what to think,\u201d says Cumming, referring to the show\u2019s formula of taking a toxic social issue, such as abortion, and challenging consensus views on the right and the left. That ambivalence extends to the characters, too. \u201cI mean, Alicia is turning into this kind of bitch,\u201d says Cumming. \u201cSo it\u2019s constantly challenging your allegiances and changing the partisan nature of these TV shows. People you really like do terrible things.\u201d Or as New Yorker TV critic Emily Nussbaum, shrewdly pointed out in a review of season six: \u201cOn The Good Wife, there is no success without corruption. The higher Alicia climbs, the more compromised she becomes, and the more at ease with compromise.\u201d Nevertheless Cumming has been ready to move on for a while. \u201cI\u2019m over it,\u201d he says. \u201cI was going to leave last year. I said: \u2018I\u2019m bored. I do the same thing again and again. There\u2019s only so many ways I can raise my eyebrows. I was talking to my team. I said that I feel like all I do is come into the room and go: \u2018Alicia, what the hell is going on?\u2019 and literally the next day I got the script and the first line was: \u2018Alicia, what the hell is going on?\u2019\u201d Not that Cumming isn\u2019t thrilled for the ways The Good Wife has enriched his life. He knows shows like that don\u2019t come along often. You sense it in the sheer energy and enthusiasm and fulfilment that emanates from him. \u201cThe show has changed both my perception and the world\u2019s perception of me as an actor,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause now I can play men in suits. I\u2019ve become a grown-up.\u201d Alan Cumming wears maroon suit by Valentino; shirt by Sandro; palm tree bomber by Paul Smith; shirt by Jil Sander; and tie by Saint Laurent by Hedi Slimane.

      "body": "<p>If you were dropped into the middle of a conversation with Alan Cumming, this is how it might flow: \u201cYou know <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jul/11/geraldine-james-actor\">Geraldine James</a>? Every time we see her\u2026 what\u2019s that movie she\u2019s in? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/45-years\"><em>45 Years</em></a>! With Charlotte Rampling \u2013 so nice to see a movie where they don\u2019t cut back and forth all the time, and you get to watch people rather than being bombarded. Anyway, every time we see Geraldine James we go: \u2018Would you like a bacon sandwich?\u2019, because years ago I saw <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/sep/17/your-next-box-set-jewel-in-the-crown\"><em>The Jewel in the Crown</em></a>, and there\u2019s a bit where she\u2019s just had an affair with someone, and she comes out the next morning and says: \u2018Would you like a bacon sandwich?\u2019\u201d He chuckles. \u201cI\u2019ve always had shorthand ways to remind Grant [Cumming\u2019s husband] who people are, and she\u2019s Bacon Sandwich,\u201d he explains, before dashing on. \u201cThere are some hilarious ones\u2026 who was I doing the other day? He\u2019s British, said he didn\u2019t like Madonna, and told a story about getting peed on.\u201d</p> <p>I never do find out who was peed on because Cumming is rhapsodising on the vegan butcher he visited in Minnesota while touring his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jan/08/alan-cumming-shows-some-emotion-on-his-sappy-songs-australian-tour\">Sappy Songs roadshow</a>. \u201cThey had this Porterhouse steak and I got some Canadian ham, and there\u2019s these Korean spare ribs, delicious \u2013 they\u2019ve got a slightly chewy texture.\u201d Talking to Cumming is like being inside his head, a fizzing ball of enquiry ping-ponging from subject to subject \u2013 his ardent support for Bernie Sanders, the time he was replaced in a sci-fi movie by Dame Judi Dench (\u201cI said: \u2018That bitch is always getting my roles\u2019\u201d), and why he only accepted a career-changing part in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-good-wife\"><em>The Good Wife </em></a>\u201cabsolutely under duress\u201d. It\u2019s a quality that helped make his 2014 memoir <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/283964/s/not-my-father-s-son/\"><em>Not My Father\u2019s Son</em></a> oddly exhilarating in spite of its poignant tale of a merciless, philandering father so bent on tormenting his sons that Cumming has \u201cnot one memory from our childhoods that is not clouded by fear or humiliation or pain\u201d.</p> <p>He writes like he talks, in a no-holds-barred rush of observation and confession. It\u2019s why he enjoys touring the country singing, because for once he\u2019s not acting. \u201cI love the connection you get with the audience. There\u2019s nothing like it.\u201d He rolls up his sleeve to reveal a tattoo on his arm of EM Forster\u2019s famous line from <em>Howard\u2019s End</em>: \u201cOnly Connect.\u201d Sometimes he\u2019ll grab a phone or camera from someone in the audience and delete what they\u2019ve been recording, because that\u2019s not connection.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bd0605aa9998a866b72e1d2bb8c442872c8967a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bd0605aa9998a866b72e1d2bb8c442872c8967a/218_1552_5215_5688/917.jpg\" alt=\"A yellow-suited Alan Cumming in a dance move held by the grey-suited Alan Cumming\" width=\"917\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018In Cabaret, I was a semi-clad pixie that was sexually ambiguous, European and weird\u2019: Alan Cumming gets to grips with himself.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phillip Toledano for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re going to record me and take a photo when I\u2019m doing a concert.

When you\u2019re picking up your dog\u2019s poop and someone says: \u2018Can I have a photo?\u2019 and I say: \u2018I have shit in my hands\u2019 and they go: \u2018Oh, once you put it in the bin, can I have a photo?\u2019 I will say no.\u201d He says Americans sometimes seemed shocked by his frankness, but frankness is part of his appeal. He once took a neon pen to the wall of his London flat and wrote out Roosevelt\u2019s Depression-era mantra \u201cThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\u201d a principle he seems determined to live by.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t have to have my photo taken with everybody who asks. There are times when I say no</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is one particularly vivid scene in <em>Not My Father\u2019s Son</em> in which the 13-year-old Cumming buys a dinner service from a stand at the Angus Show in Arbroath. It is cold and damp, as it often is in Scotland, and his father has disappeared with a woman he has accidentally on purpose run into. Alone, shivering in the smirr, Cumming bids for the crockery. It is \u201cbeige and bland with 70s-style flowers printed on every plate, bowl and cup,\u201d but to the young boy it represents escape. \u201cI would be eating off them in a place where there were buses and taxis and where I would never have to wait in a public place for hours, cold and damp, wondering if my father had concluded his liaison.\u201d</p> <p>That dinner service, or pieces of it, survived for many years, until Cumming moved to New York and the promise it embodied was well and truly met. This summer he will perform at the Festival in Edinburgh, the city where it all began for him 32 years ago as one half of the trendy Kelvinside thespians Victor &amp; Barry (Forbes Masson played Victor).

After watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I went to my sister\u2019s room crying hysterically. Eventually I got the words out: \u201cBuffy\u2019s dead!\u201d It was the first real loss I experienced. And I didn\u2019t have the words to describe it. To be able to do that to someone through your writing, that\u2019s the dream. The first TV to inspire me to write was Kathy Burke\u2019s remarkable Walking and Talking. More recently, Tituss Burgess in Tina Fey\u2019s Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt [a big black flamboyant wannabe Broadway star] inspired the character in the second series of my TV show Chewing Gum. The things they were brave enough to do with his character allowed me to be brave enough to do what I wanted with mine. It was like I was waiting for permission. When they see the filthy things I\u2019ve written, people think I\u2019m fearless, that I have no filter, but if they knew the scope of inappropriate things that go on in my head they\u2019d thank me for how much I don\u2019t say. The most beautiful TV writing I can remember was Sonia saying to Pauline Fowler: \u201cBring up a baby? You couldn\u2019t bring up phlegm.\u201d We\u2019d all watch EastEnders, but it was only me who\u2019d act it out. My sister would hear me talking to myself in the bathroom mirror in a Scottish accent. Except I\u2019d never met a Scottish person. I didn\u2019t know I was acting, but I was \u2013 I was running through my own made-up BBC dramas. Like most people my age, today I watch all of my TV online. Perhaps it\u2019s because we lack commitment. We don\u2019t want to be told when something\u2019s on \u2013 I\u2019ll watch when I want to watch. But that means I lose something I loved \u2013 that excitement of saying at school: \u201cDid you watch Big Brother last night?\u201d TV is the glue. Now we daren\u2019t talk about it, in case of spoilers. As a kid I\u2019d watch a cable channel called Trouble, comedies like Moesha and Kenan and Kel. It was the only place to see black people on TV. If there was something on, it was always comedy, always American. Because we lived in Aldgate, which wasn\u2019t a black area, these shows became what we thought a black world looked like. My generation of black British people often feels part American because of what we learned from TV. If we crack jokes, we can find ourselves doing it in an African-American accent. Even now there\u2019s nothing mainstream on TV that shows the average black British life. You have black shows with black people, and white shows with white people \u2013 in the real world, most of us are racially integrated. We need to start showing that. The problem is something to do with the way America likes to see Britain. Americans want to see Downton Abbey. So British TV babyfeeds them what they want. We make things palatable and one-dimensional. But this is Britain \u2013 we are a mesh of cultures. I want to see that on our screens. TV has a social responsibility. It doesn\u2019t only reflect society; society also reflects TV. We have a moral obligation to hold a mirror to the people watching the shows. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do: I\u2019m not pushing \u201cblack\u201d, I\u2019m pushing unity among men and women of all colours. So much of what we see on TV lacks diversity, and that\u2019s to do with privilege. Privilege distances you from reality. Chewing Gum is a sitcom set on an estate in east London. Its central character is a girl from a Pentecostal background who decides to embark on a more worldly lifestyle \u2013 it\u2019s about adolescence 10 years too late. In my dreams everybody is watching it, finding out about my world and realising it\u2019s not what they imagined. That it\u2019s not terrifying. That the people here are hilarious, people you might want to make friends with, people like you.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s unlikely there will be many more albums this year that will unite high art and low in the same way as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s jaw-slackening latest. Stealth-released like its predecessor, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s self-titled visual album of 2013, Lemonade was expected to be political, trailed as it was by February\u2019s polemical Formation, and a paradigm-shifting Super Bowl half-time performance with Black Pantherised dancers. Black lives continue to matter on Lemonade \u2013 Formation, still startling, is included; Malcolm X is sampled and Trayvon Martin\u2019s mother makes an appearance \u2013 but Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s political bent takes a back seat to personal matters; these are, though, expansively contextualised. The album\u2019s title comes from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 90-year-old grandmother-in-law, Hattie White, who endorsed the old epigram that since life served her lemons, she made lemonade; a testament to female endurance and pragmatism. What unfolds is an album about male-pattern infidelity and female self-examination. That cycle can be broken with forgiveness, Beyonc\u00e9 implies \u2013 but not before she breaks stuff with a baseball bat on Hold Up. With a sassy dancehall lilt, Beyonce unexpectedly quotes a Yeah Yeah Yeahs track, a cocktail of warmth and fury. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse, looking jealous or crazy?\u201d she wonders. She appears, for half of the album, to be as mad as hell at Jay Z. It is tremendous. At its basest level, then, Lemonade is a gossip rag, as art-directed by a Vogue stylist who\u2019s smoked the budget. In a series of sumptuous vignettes, in which Serena Williams gyrates (on the electrifying Sorry) and a range of other famous black female figures make visual cameos, Beyonc\u00e9 appears to launder her business in public. Rumours of a rift in the marriage ricocheted around the internet in 2014 after Solange Knowles, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s hipper little sister, attacked Jay Z in a lift. Now Beyonc\u00e9 names names (\u201cBecky with the good hair\u201d), regrets the ring, and threatens to leave if he \u201ctry that shit again\u201d. So far, so daytime-TV. The songs, though, are not just prurient catnip, but actual dynamite \u2013 a dazzling series of edgy, but tuneful collaborations with a diverse array of guests. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s hurt is articulated magnificently, often quoting Somali-British poet Warsan Shire, who doesn\u2019t mince words like \u201cmenses\u201d. You can hear the confident hand of Jack White on the superb digital-analogue confection Don\u2019t Hurt Yourselfcorrect where Beyonc\u00e9 unleashes a righteous hip-hop blues-woman holler. Even heavier and more freaky with organ is Freedom, a declaration of intent that features a typically electrifying Kendrick Lamar verse. The tail end finds Beyonc\u00e9 reconciled with the man she still loves \u2013 paving the way for Lemonade to be previewed on Tidal, Jay Z\u2019s streaming service. Cynics will cry foul, that Beyonc\u00e9 remains an entitled superstar, raging at a paper tiger. Those cynics will be ignoring one of this year\u2019s finest albums.",

It has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc to create a valuable entity that drives profitable activity; so must data be broken down, analysed for it to have value.\u201d There was just one thing wrong with the metaphor. Oil is a natural resource; it has to be found, drilled for and pumped from the bowels of the Earth. Data, in contrast, is a highly unnatural resource. It has to be created before it can be extracted and refined. Which raises the question of who, exactly, creates this magical resource? Answer: you and me. In the old days \u2013 the era of the Tesco Clubcard \u2013 we did it by shopping in Tesco, which could link us to the stuff we bought. As the internet took hold, though, our data productivity increased exponentially, because everything we did online left a trail of digital data that could easily be mined by the internet corporations with whose services we interacted. Tesco turned out to be just a mom-and-pop operation compared with the internet giants such as Google and Facebook, the Exxons and Shells of the online world. But unlike the oil giants, which at least sell products to real consumers, the extractive firms of cyberspace merely provide \u201cfree\u201d services to their users in return for their personal data trails, which they then sell to advertisers in a vast, hidden global system of high-speed online auctions. (If you want a glimpse of this system in action, install a plug-in such as Ghostery on your browser and see who is tracking you as you browse.) And in the process they have created a new kind of industry, what the Harvard scholar Shoshana Zuboff calls surveillance capitalism. The big idea underpinning this new system is that users do all the work. Neat, eh? By conducting Google&nbsp;searches, posting status updates to Facebook, tweeting, putting&nbsp;our CVs on LinkedIn and so on,&nbsp;we provide \u2013 free, gratis \u2013 ready-made data that can be extracted, refined and sold to the ad-brokers and advertisers that are the internet companies\u2019 real customers. So the (un)natural resource that powers these new extractive industries is what\u2019s called user-generated content. There is, however, a fly in the ointment. It is that while much of this content is innocuous and harmless, a lot of it is not. In fact, some of it is vile beyond belief. And so, in theory, the companies on whose&nbsp;services it is posted could conceivably be held responsible for publishing such horrors, with consequent legal liability. As luck would have it, though, this potential downside was neatly neutralised many years ago by a clause in a long-forgotten piece of US legislation \u2013 Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. This says that \u201cno provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider\u201d. As a get-out-of-jail card, this one would be hard to beat. It was snuck into the bill at the 11th hour by two members of Congress and buried in over a thousand pages of prime legal verbiage in a move memorably summarised by one commentator as \u201chow two members of Congress helped create a trillion or so dollars of value\u201d. But if the executives of Facebook and co won\u2019t go to jail for publishing user-generated crap, there still remains the problem that if their users&nbsp;got to see some of the horrendous stuff that people post online then they might be sufficiently repelled to cancel their subscriptions, as it were. So the companies have to find ways of filtering the uploads. They do this by getting users to flag objectionable content, deploying machine-learning software and employing secret armies of moderators to do what is clearly traumatic and distressing work. The companies are thus caught between a Sisyphean rock and a hard place. On the one hand, they need the torrent (400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, for example) because it provides the resource that they mine. On the other, if the data flow becomes too polluted then their money pumps may stall. It\u2019s almost enough to make one feel sorry for them. Almost.",

      "bodyText": "First published as a limited edition hardback by the independent Tartarus Press in 2014, Andrew Michael Hurley\u2019s debut novel emerged like one of the rare beasts that surely lingers in the trees in the Loney before going on to win the Costa first novel award. The Loney is \u201ca wild and useless length of English coastline\u201d in Hurley\u2019s native Lancashire, to which the narrator is taken with his family and their local congregation on an Easter retreat in the mid 1970s. Everything about the Loney is off-kilter, starting with its status as a pilgrimage destination of choice. The house where the retreat is to take place, Moorings, is a place singularly adrift from the modern world: an abandoned mansion perched on the edge of a benighted landscape where time has become clotted and stagnates, and the faith to which the pilgrims cling so ardently has long gone native and mated with the occult paganism that lurks in the woods. The unspoken hope of the party is that the narrator\u2019s brother, Hanny, who is mute and institutionalised, will be cured of his affliction by visiting the local shrine; however, as the story progresses, it becomes apparent that all the pilgrims have their own secrets, sins and crosses to&nbsp;bear, and that all are in some sense seeking absolution. The boys\u2019 mother, Mummer, is a woman on the edge: her fierce mourning for Father Bernard\u2019s predecessor, the waspish and sadistic Father Wilfred, bespeaks a faith worn threadbare by the trials she has undergone. The Loney evokes perfectly a peculiarly English breed of hangdog provincialism, impregnated with a surreal horror and sense of imminent spiritual crisis that is all its own. The landscape is as much a character as any of its human inhabitants: dank and foreboding, its every feature seems calculated to instil a sense of dread. In Hurley\u2019s hands, fairytale, folklore and occult spiritualism mingle with stock gothic motifs and narrative techniques: a lost diary is found to contain terrible secrets; a ghoulish discovery is made that prompts an account of events long past. But, like the best gothic novels, The Loney is not merely thrills and chills: it is also a perceptive and nuanced exploration of the interrelation between faith, community and nature, which draws on Hurley\u2019s intimate knowledge of the terrain \u2013 both physical and spiritual \u2013 it traverses. As such, the effect is both strikingly assured and authentic, while also comprehensively destabilising any assumptions the reader may have had about all three. The Loney is published by John Murray (\u00a37.99). Click here to order it for \u00a36.99",

      "bodyText": "The long-awaited federal government response to the Productivity Commission\u2019s report on legal assistance services is \u201cinadequate and misleading\u201d because it suggests new funding for the sector, the Federation of Community Legal Centres says. On Friday the attorney general, George Brandis, issued a statement in response to the commission\u2019s report which was handed to government in September 2014. The report called for a $200m boost to the sector every year to meet demand, and recommended that 60% of this come from the federal government. \u201cOver the next five years, the Australian government will provide $1.6 bn for legal aid commissions and community legal centres through the national partnership agreement and direct funding agreements with Indigenous legal assistance providers,\u201d Brandis said. \u201cThe Australian government is committed to doing what it can to increase funding levels for legal assistance in a tight fiscal environment. This is demonstrated by the $15m legal assistance component of the $100m women\u2019s safety package, and the restoration of $25.5m in funding to the legal assistance sector.\u201d Federation of Community Legal Centres spokesman Darren Lewin-Hill told Guardian Australia on Sunday that the timing and wording of the response risked creating the false impression that it was a pre-budget announcement, when in fact no new funding had been offered. In June 2015 the former prime minister, Tony Abbott, signed an agreement cutting 30% of funding to the centres across the country from July 2017, despite the Productivity Commission\u2019s finding that every $1 spent saved the community $18. Brandis\u2019s response did nothing to reverse those cuts, Lewin-Hill said. \u201cThe response from the government is clearly inadequate, and misleading both in its timing and in its suggestion that the funding it mentions is in any way new money that responds to our concerns,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact the response merely restates existing funding that locks in a 30% national cut to community legal centres set for July 2017. If those cuts are not reversed in the budget and funding boosted in line with the Productivity Commission, the federal government will be locking in severe impacts for thousands of vulnerable people, including women facing family violence that community legal centres help to secure intervention orders through the courts.\u201d Of the commission\u2019s recommended $200m annual boost to combined legal assistance services \u2013 which includes community legal centres, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services, family violence prevention and legal services, and legal aid commissions \u2013 community legal centres nationally are asking for $14.4m a year, on top of a reversal of the cuts. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, told the ABC that the response from Brandis was \u201cshameful\u201d. \u201cIf the government really wants to make a difference to the scourge of domestic violence in this country, it would deliver community legal centres increased funding today,\u201d Dreyfus said.",

      "bodyText": "Any film dramatising the unimaginable horrors of the Holocaust risks accusations of trivialising, misrepresenting or exploiting its awful subject matter. When L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes\u2019s debut feature, a harrowing drama set in Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1944, premiered last year at Cannes, the New York Times critic Manohla Dargis dismissed it as a \u201cradically dehistoricised, intellectually repellent\u201d work in which \u201ctechnical virtuosity\u201d risked diverting the audience\u2019s attention from \u201cthe misery on screen\u201d. Focusing its tightly held, shallow-focus gaze on a single prisoner in whose face we see reflections of atrocities too hellish to depict, Son of Saul is indeed a stylistic masterpiece, a film of precise visual and aural design, executed with fearsome skill, precision and commitment. Yet far from being a \u201ctechnical\u201d triumph, the claustrophobic aesthetic that Nemes employs has a powerful moral raison d\u2019etre, seemingly born out of a desire to address a subject that arguably has no place in dramatic cinema. Feature first-timer G\u00e9za R\u00f6hrig is astonishing as Saul Ausl\u00e4nder, a Hungarian-Jewish prisoner forced to work on the Nazis\u2019 extermination production line as a member of the Sonderkommando, the special squad whose controversial legacy has inspired such narrative features as Tim Blake Nelson\u2019s The Grey Zone (2001). We first meet Saul emerging from incongruously leafy woodlands (Nemes has cited Elem Klimov\u2019s 1985 Come and See as a touchstone), shepherding new arrivals into the gas chambers where they will be poisoned, their bodies burned, their ashes shovelled into a river. Saul\u2019s expression is one of mortified catatonia \u2013 a silent scream within this ninth circle of hell. But when a young boy survives Zyklon B inhalation only to be summarily suffocated by a doctor, Saul claims the body to be that of his son, whom he resolves to bury with dignity. His mission is desperate and threatens to endanger a planned uprising among his fellow prisoners. \u201cWe will die because of you,\u201d one tells him, to which Saul replies: \u201cWe are already dead.\u201d Even writing that brief synopsis feels almost obscenely prurient. Yet M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Erd\u00e9ly\u2019s camera consistently pushes the horrors that surround Saul to and beyond the edges of the film\u2019s 4x3 frame, the narrowness of the image somehow broadening the scope of its impact. In several sequences set within the gas chambers and furnaces of Saul\u2019s netherworld existence, only R\u00f6hrig\u2019s face is in focus, the Boschian landscape of suffering and death in which he dwells remaining expressionistic rather than explicit. Yet even as our eyes are turned away from the abyss, an incessant soundtrack of screams, barks, orders, gunshots, cries and whispers evokes a cataclysmic landscape of evil unbound. The effect is utterly overpowering. Writing about the impossibility of representing the Holocaust in dramas such as Spielberg\u2019s Schindler\u2019s List, the great French film-maker Claude Lanzmann (whose monumental Shoah eschewed archive footage for eye-witness testimony) famously declared that \u201cfiction is a transgression\u201d and spoke of his own belief in \u201ca ban on depiction\u201d. Yet, after seeing Son of Saul, Lanzmann concluded that it gave \u201ca very real sense of what it was like to be in the Sonderkommando\u201d, in a manner that was \u201cnot at all melodramatic\u201d and \u201cdone with a very great modesty\u201d. Lanzmann\u2019s most recent feature, The Last of the Unjust, revisited a 1975 interview with Benjamin Murmelstein, the last surviving president of the Jewish Council in Theresienstadt whom some had branded a collaborator, but whom Lanzmann found to be \u201cextraordinarily courageous\u201d. Although different in form, Nemes\u2019s fictional film (inspired by the real-life accounts recorded in the \u201cscrolls of Auschwitz\u201d) shares with Lanzmann\u2019s work a preoccupation with what Primo Levi called the Nazis\u2019 \u201cdemonic crime\u201d of attempting \u201cto shift on to others \u2013 specifically, the victims \u2013 the burden of guilt\u201d. Within the godless void of his enslaved existence, Saul\u2019s desperate search for a rabbi to recite the Mourner\u2019s Kaddish over the body of the child \u2013 who may or may not be his own (we are never sure and it never matters) \u2013 seems to represent an act of atonement, a cleansing ritual amid the stench of the Sonderkommando\u2019s mephitic existence. Accepting the Oscar for foreign language film, Nemes stated that \u201cthe hope of this film\u201d was to show that \u201ceven in the darkest hours, there might be a voice within us that allows us to remain human\u201d. Those dark hours (the film takes place over two days and one night) are as vividly, devastatingly portrayed as anything I have experienced in the cinema; I struggle to remember the last time a non-documentary film proved so profoundly, soul-shakingly distressing. This is as it should be \u2013 anything less would be immoral and irresponsible. Yet, unthinkable as it seems, there is a glimmer of light in this appalling darkness, infinitesimal yet inextinguishable. Ultimately, it is that glimmer that makes Son of Saul so traumatic. Days after watching it I remain haunted by Saul\u2019s face, his skin covered in the ashes of the dead, his eyes alert with anxiety and anguish, a recognisable trace of humanity in world beyond belief.",

      "bodyText": "The scene is Pleasure, a gay club in an unnamed city in the north of England, \u201cwhere men come to express their instincts and desires\u201d. Hedonism rules. Out the back with her knitting and her bumper pack of bleach is Val, lovely Valerie, \u201cbelle of the bogs! Lily of the Lavvie! Queen of the Latrine\u201d, the middle-aged woman who wipes up after her clientele and offers the maternal wisdom their mothers cannot. Why does she do it? Her secret is central to the tragedy. Mark Simpson\u2019s new chamber opera, to a libretto by Melanie Challenger, deftly directed by Tim Albery and designed by Leslie Travers, received its world premiere on Thursday at the Howard Assembly Room, Leeds, in a collaboration between Opera North, the Royal Opera and Aldeburgh Music. With a sterling cast led by Lesley Garrett \u2013 powerfully eloquent, suppressing her natural glamour and embracing dowdiness \u2013 and Steven Page brilliant as a cynical drag queen, all angles and bones and bling and slap, it has the makings of a hit. Simpson, 27, caught the public eye in 2006 when he won both BBC young musician of the year, as a clarinettist, and BBC Proms/Guardian young composer of the year. The opera is based on his own experiences in his late teens. \u201cA lot has changed since my 19-year-old, peroxide-blond-haired self was running around clubs in Liverpool telling drag queens I was going to write an opera about them,\u201d he has said. While the subject matter is raw and fierce, the score treads a traditional but distinctive operatic path. Simpson\u2019s self-confessed aim is that his music should supply those qualities of intimacy, beauty, warmth, pain and suffering that he sees lacking in much contemporary opera. He does this with skill, variety and strong dramatic impulse. Using a 10-strong instrumental ensemble \u2013 the versatile Manchester-based Psappha, conducted by Nicholas Kok \u2013 he gives his four singers (and pre-taped chorus) grateful, lyrical vocal lines. Tenor Nick Pritchard as Matthew, vulnerable and hungry for love, and baritone Timothy Nelson as Nathan, uncertain of his past and his present, brought ardour and, for want of a better word, muscularity. The orchestral writing, using single strings, two clarinets, keyboard, trumpet, trombone and percussion, is rich with fluent melody and detailed effect. The prominent use of two bass clarinets gives a velvety caress to the sound, offsetting and enhancing the rhythmic urgency of bongos, conga, temple blocks and marimba. Its impact is immediate. It will be fascinating to see Simpson\u2019s prodigious talent develop. NMC has just released a disc of what we will have to call his early works, written when he was barely old&nbsp;enough&nbsp;to go clubbing. In a week heavy with voluptuary pleasures for Tim Albery, his 2010 production of Tannh\u00e4user was revived at the Royal Opera House. Then, as now, the baritone Christian Gerhaher in the small but potent role of Wolfram shone the brightest light \u2013 an attribute generally lacking in this stygian production. Dark is fine, but Tannh\u00e4user lasts more than four hours. The Venusberg, a medieval red-light district of naughtiness, could have done with some of Pleasure\u2019s flashing fairy lights. Alas, all illumination is kept hidden behind the mock proscenium arch of this theatre-within-a-theatre staging. Beneath an all-encompassing canopy of black, the action seemed to shrink to hobbit scale, though the German tenor Peter Seiffert, singing the title role of the ignoble hero, is a physically towering presence. This is an enormous sing, but despite sterling efforts, Seiffert sounded weary at times, with a tendency to slow the lively tempo set by the conductor, Hartmut Haenchen. With his greatcoat and side-whiskers, Seiffert looked more Dickensian Vincent Crummles than irresistible lothario. Nevertheless both sexy Venus (a slightly underpowered Sophie Koch) and prim Elisabeth (a fervent, soaring Emma Bell) want him, the former with his clothes off, the other with them on and buttoned up. All opened promisingly, with an orgy of gymnastic leapfrogging across a large dining table \u2013 surprisingly without a \u201cdon\u2019t try this at home\u201d warning \u2013 in a clean and health-giving bacchanale, choreographed by Jasmin Vardimon. Danish bass Stephen Milling (Herrmann) and British tenor Ed Lyon (Walther) had presence and style. The Royal Opera Orchestra settled into the score with notably glowing contributions from lower strings and from the entire horn section including those off stage. The performance was dedicated to the memory of Christopher Davies, a horn player with the ROH orchestra for 20 years, who died in February. The chorus was magnificent. Their account of the Pilgrim\u2019s Chorus, on their return from Rome, was a high point. Less convincing was the gap in the black drape that revealed a bright red fire extinguisher, enough to raise a giggle if not to quench the flames of Tannh\u00e4user\u2019s fatally confused passion. English National Opera has announced a new artistic director, nine months after the departure of John Berry. Daniel Kramer, 39, American-born and a British citizen with an international career, is a progressive and unexpected choice. His award-winning Punch and Judy, the first of ENO\u2019s young director initiatives at the Young Vic, touched hearts and nerves, as did his Duke Bluebeard\u2019s Castle for the main stage. He has experience of dance and musical theatre: his Hair for the Gate theatre was outstanding. A director of energy and drive, he does not do things by halves. For a company fighting so many battles, financial and of morale, he will not easily be lured into compromise. His new Tristan and Isolde, designed by Anish Kapoor, opens at ENO next month, conducted by Edward Gardner. It\u2019s far too early to have the slightest idea what Kramer will do. Dull is unlikely to be a word much used. Star rating (out of five) Pleasure **** Tannh\u00e4user *** \u2022 Pleasure is touring until 14 May; Tannh\u00e4user runs at the ROH until 15 May",

      "bodyText": "In May 1983, Brix Smith, then aged 20, arrived in Manchester. A Californian by birth and disposition, her first impressions of the city were not favourable. The buildings, she writes in her entertainingly bonkers memoir, The Rise, the Fall and the Rise, \u201clooked like mean structures where horrible atrocities had been committed\u201d. The sky was \u201ctoxic\u201d, the people were \u201cjoyless\u201d, their clothes \u201cdrab\u201d. As a taxi took her towards Prestwich, where the man she had fallen for just six weeks earlier lived, he pointed out the local landmarks: \u201cLook, Brixie, there\u2019s the Boddingtons brewery! There\u2019s Strangeways prison!\u201d Entering the lobby of his building, she was struck by the dirt on the walls and the \u201cstrong odour of urine\u201d. In his flat, there were cats everywhere and items of unwashed underwear belonging to his ex-girlfriend. As they sat down for a cuppa, he reached out on to the window ledge for the pint of milk that sat there alongside a pack of back bacon, a carton of eggs and a Hovis loaf. \u201cI was incredulous,\u201d she writes. \u201cPerhaps this was a traditional resourceful British custom.\u201d To paraphrase one of the album titles of her then boyfriend Mark E Smith, this was Brix\u2019s fast-track introduction to the strange and frightening world of the Fall, the British post-punk group with whom she would play guitar and co-write songs for the next six years. Given that she is someone who, as she mentions more than once, is guided by her instinct and intuition, why did she not turn and run at the sight of his ex-girlfriend\u2019s discarded knickers? \u201cGood question,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cFirstly, I was so excited to be in England. I was young and in love and I was in this cool band that had transfixed me from the first time I had heard them. It felt like I was on a magic carpet ride.\u201d That ride, which was more roller coaster from hell than magic carpet, is the most enthralling section of her memoir, coming after her troubled childhood in Los Angeles and before her second great doomed romance with the classical violinist Nigel Kennedy, who, though not a born contrarian like Smith, has an ego and controlling streak to match his. She describes Kennedy as \u201ca cross between Amadeus Mozart and Keith Moon\u201d and tells me he once tried to roll over his car for kicks while she and her mother were passengers. It\u2019s that kind of book: full of outlandish, occasionally alarming anecdotes that vividly evoke her wild, impulsive youth. I meet Brix Smith Start, as she is now known, in her local cafe near Old Street, east London. Now 53, and happily married to Philip Start, a fashion entrepreneur who once owned the Woodhouse chain, she retains the boundless enthusiasm of a Californian teenager. She talks as she writes, in flurries of excited eagerness followed by moments of semi-reflection, and her speech is peppered with therapy speak and new age philosophy \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve always been super-guided about things, intuitively and spiritually.\u201d For all that, she is hugely entertaining company. \u201cIt took 15 years of cooking,\u201d she says of the memoir. \u201cI needed to find a voice and to be honest and to write it with love. I didn\u2019t want to be bitter or&nbsp;spiteful.\u201d It begins in Disneyland with her first great love, Mickey Mouse, on whom she was fixated throughout her childhood. It was, she says, the most enjoyable part to write, not least because she used \u201ca technique of sense memory, self-hypnosis and deep meditation that&nbsp;meant I could go back and put myself into situations where I could smell what was cooking and feel the texture of the clothes I was&nbsp;wearing.\u201d She was born Laura Elisse Salenger in 1962, and her parents, Lucy and Steve, divorced before she was two. Her mother worked for CBS Television, leaving her in the care of their Mexican maid, Carmen, who was \u201cmean\u201d, often depositing her in her cot for hours with&nbsp;the central heating on max. Sometimes, she went to the CBS studio and watched from the wings, \u201centranced\u201d as Sonny &amp; Cher rehearsed their weekly programme. \u201cI learned the work ethic early from watching Cher on her show,\u201d she says. Occasionally, too, she went to stay with her father, a neurotic and distant Beverly Hills psychiatrist with whom she was \u201cbesotted\u201d, and his Swedish girlfriend. As a young teenager, she attended the elite Crossroads school in Los Angeles and later Bennington College in Vermont, where her contemporaries included Bret Easton Ellis and Donna Tartt as well as \u201cone of the Getty girls and Princess Farahnaz, the ex-shah of Iran\u2019s daughter\u201d. When her mother remarried and took a job in Chicago, Brix moved there, too, becoming a pothead and a punk. She played The Guns of Brixton by the Clash so often that her friends nicknamed her&nbsp;Brixton, later shortened to Brix. It was in Chicago, too, that she discovered the Fall through a friend who owned their EP Slates. \u201cWhen I heard the Fall,\u201d she tells me, \u201csomething hit me so hard I became obsessed with them, though not in a psycho fan way. I listened to Slates over&nbsp;and over and over until I understood it, internalised it and then could move. It was kind of like my relationship with food, really. I tend to&nbsp;have the same meal over and over too until I discover another one I like.\u201d The book touches on what she calls her \u201cborderline bulimia\u201d, though often self-mockingly: one chapter is called Barbie Cleaned up My Barf, another, Interview With a Vompire. The latter begins: \u201cI find vomiting both heinous and hilarious in equal measures. My life is splattered with vomiting stories.\u201d She has a tendency throughout not to linger long on the terrible things that have happened, as evinced by a short, shocking chapter in which she revisits being tied up and raped in a basement by a former school acquaintance she calls J. It ends: \u201cWriting this now is the first time I\u2019ve ever openly acknowledged it. For all these years, my subconscious mind has kept my secret safe, even from me\u2026 Some people may call this denial. For me, it was survival.\u201d Her life changed dramatically after a chance meeting with Mark E Smith, whom she literally bumped into after a gig in Chicago. They chatted, hit it off and she went back to his cheap motel room. \u201cI had found my soulmate,\u201d she&nbsp;writes. Perhaps the most uncompromising, abrasive and mysterious of all the British post-punk groups, the Fall on paper were not a good fit for a Californian girl raised on Disneyland, summer camp and courtside seats at Lakers games. For a while, though, it worked. The pair got married in a register office in Bury two months after her arrival in Manchester, celebrating with sausage rolls, crisps and pickled onions in the Eagle &amp; Child pub. She was 20 years old (he was 26) and had known him for less than six months. \u201cI had no maid of honour, no friends and family there,\u201d she writes. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone at my wedding apart from the band and Mark\u2019s parents and&nbsp;sisters.\u201d Brix\u2019s presence seemed initially to mellow Mark E Smith. He began dressing smartly and the Fall songs became detectably less abrasive, a smidgen more melodic. They even made it into the top 40 with their cover of the Kinks\u2019 Victoria. Then, suddenly and brutally, it didn\u2019t. In 1989, she and Mark were divorced but only after a protracted period in which she remained part of the group \u2013 even though he refused to speak to her, was sleeping with someone else and that someone else was on the road with them. By then their relationship was unravelling slowly and messily against the backdrop of the Fall\u2019s supremely dysfunctional dynamic. She recalls whole tours where band members barely exchanged a word. \u201cThere were red flags all along the way that I chose to ignore or I made excuses and dealt with it,\u201d she says now. \u201cIt began to go really bad when I signed a deal for the Adult Net [her own more pop-oriented group]. I wasn\u2019t under the control of Mark E Smith any more, and with Mark it\u2019s all about control. He controlled the money and the band and me. It was a dictatorship, basically.\u201d Why did she put up with it for so long, though? \u201cInitially, I was driven by creativity. Writing and making the music satisfied my soul. I didn\u2019t want a child, I wanted to be an artist. Plus, we loved each other and made magic together and I do think he was happy for a while. And proud of what he had achieved. It mellowed him and took the edge off his anger.\u201d As with other books that have been written about the Fall by ex-members of the Fall, this is an insider chronicle of bullying and verbal abuse as well as the creation of often singular music. The singer\u2019s talent for offending people reaches a nadir of sorts when, having rejoined the band in the mid 90s, Brix witnesses an ugly incident in Denmark in which a drunken Smith, incensed that the Fall have to share a minibus with another, younger group, reaches, \u201cTourette\u2019s-like, for the most offensive thing to say\u201d. In this instance, that meant screaming, \u201cGet away from the fucking bus, boy!\u201d at a member of a mixed-race group. Whether intentionally racist or the result of a mind twisted by years of sustained amphetamine and alcohol abuse, it earned Smith a pre-gig kicking from the younger group that left him with a broken nose and several missing teeth. \u201cHe turned up just as we were about to go on stage to thousands of people,\u201d she recalls, \u201chis nose looking like a mouse\u2019s snout, but nobody seemed to notice and he sang brilliantly.\u201d Did she gain any insight as to the source of Smith\u2019s anger while they were together? \u201cThat\u2019s not really for me to say,\u201d she answers. \u201cPeople said he had a chip on both shoulders about being northern. I remember him talking about fucking southern bastards a lot and not wanting to come to London. He hated London intensely. He\u2019s quite contrarian as a person and as a writer, which is what gives him his edge. My theory is that some people who are super-creative and channelling all the time need some mechanism to shut down what is happening in their head. Or they think they need the drugs or the drink to lower their resistance. It\u2019s complicated. He\u2019s complicated.\u201d Likewise Nigel Kennedy, with whom, unlike Smith, she is still on good terms. Their relationship began just as he was about to release his mega-selling version of Vivaldi\u2019s The Four Seasons and she was preparing to debut her first post-Fall album with the Adult Net. Inevitably, as his celebrity accelerated, she became swept up in the ongoing circus around him. Suddenly, she was best friends with the Linekers and a guest at Princess Diana\u2019s birthday party. \u201cWe never had any meaningful conversations,\u201d she writes with characteristic honesty, of meeting Diana. \u201cI feel like she merely tolerated me to get to Nigel \u2013 on whom she shined her magnetic light. I\u2019ve rarely seen a woman turn it on the way she did.\u201d Her chaotic relationship with Kennedy ended messily and humiliatingly, too. More than once, as she describes the oafish behaviour that attended his genius, I found myself wondering how she resisted the urge to crush his beloved Stradivarius slowly under the wheels of his beloved BMW. Somehow, though, they have managed to remain on good terms. \u201cHe\u2019s a magical elf,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cAs a friend, he\u2019s amazing, but as a boyfriend, I cannot recommend him. I went to see him play a few weeks ago. And it was great, we locked eyes and he came over and hugged me and wept on my shoulder. There is a deep bond, but his life is&nbsp;crazy.\u201d You can certainly pick them, I say. She nods. \u201cI do think my relationship with my father is key. He was a controlling, mercurial genius and a larger-than-life personality. I was looking for men to love me that were in the mould of my father because I wanted my father to love me. Once that was identified, the pattern could be&nbsp;broken.\u201d A few years ago, her aunt called to tell her that her father was in hospital and close to death. She had not spoken to him in years, though it was not for the want of trying on her part. \u201cBy then, I had realised that whatever was&nbsp;going on with him, was about him&nbsp;and not me. His pain was his pain and I had never done anything to cause&nbsp;it. Once I stepped back and saw&nbsp;that, I could forgive him.\u201d Did she call him? She nods. \u201cI said, \u2018I heard you were dying and I want you to know that I love you and I think about you and I have no anger towards you whatsoever and you can call me anytime and I\u2019d love to hear from you.\u2019\u201d How did he respond? \u201cHe sobbed. It&nbsp;was very much a long, making-peace conversation. Later, I heard that he had sobbed for three days.\u201d Well, at least you made peace with him before he died, I say, sensing she may be on the verge of sobbing herself. \u201cNo!\u201d she shrieks. \u201cHe survived.\u201d She shakes her head as if still in disbelief. \u201cAnd, did he&nbsp;call me back ever since that? No.\u201d Her memoir makes for a fast and funny read, at least until she finds true&nbsp;love with her current Mr Right and temporarily forsakes the world of indie rock for the world of fashion, setting up a chain of shops called Start in Shoreditch, only one of which&nbsp;remains in business. You suspect that the few heads that turn as she leaves the cafe recognise her from her&nbsp;role as sartorial expert on Channel 4\u2019s Gok\u2019s Fashion Fix&nbsp; a few years ago. Writing the memoir, though, has rekindled her passion for rock\u2019n\u2019roll. Songs, she says, have literally been pouring out of her. \u201cIt was like, I swear to God, a kind of bladder filled with songs in the ether had been hanging above my head all these years to which, all of a sudden, the tube went in and downloaded they came fully formed in chunks.\u201d She currently has two albums in the pipeline, one a solo outing, the other as lead singer and guitarist of the Extricated, which includes two other ex-members of the Fall. You wonder how Mark E Smith has reacted to his ex-charges performing his songs and his wife singing them? \u201cThat I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t communicate with him. I&nbsp;don\u2019t know him any more. I tried with&nbsp;Mark as I tried with everybody, but I gave up. I\u2019ve made peace within myself and I wish him the best.\u201d If her memoir is anything to go by, you suspect the feeling is not mutual.

      "body": "<p>In May 1983, Brix Smith, then aged 20, arrived in Manchester. A Californian by birth and disposition, her first impressions of the city were not favourable. The buildings, she writes in her entertainingly bonkers memoir, <em>The Rise, the Fall and the Rise</em>, \u201clooked like mean structures where horrible atrocities had been committed\u201d. The sky was \u201ctoxic\u201d, the people were \u201cjoyless\u201d, their clothes \u201cdrab\u201d.</p> <p>As a taxi took her towards Prestwich, where the man she had fallen for just six weeks earlier lived, he pointed out the local landmarks: \u201cLook, Brixie, there\u2019s the Boddingtons brewery! There\u2019s Strangeways prison!\u201d Entering the lobby of his building, she was struck by the dirt on the walls and the \u201cstrong odour of urine\u201d. In his flat, there were cats everywhere and items of unwashed underwear belonging to his ex-girlfriend. As they sat down for a cuppa, he reached out on to the window ledge for the pint of milk that sat there alongside a pack of back bacon, a carton of eggs and a Hovis loaf. \u201cI was incredulous,\u201d she writes. \u201cPerhaps this was a traditional resourceful British custom.\u201d</p> <p>To paraphrase one of the album titles of her then boyfriend Mark E Smith, this was Brix\u2019s fast-track introduction to the strange and frightening world of <a href=\"http://thefall.org/\" title=\"\">the Fall</a>, the British post-punk group with whom she would play guitar and co-write songs for the next six years. Given that she is someone who, as she mentions more than once, is guided by her instinct and intuition, why did she not turn and run at the sight of his ex-girlfriend\u2019s discarded knickers?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The book is full of outlandish, occasionally alarming anecdotes that vividly evoke Smith Start's wild, impulsive youth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cGood question,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cFirstly, I was so excited to be in England. I was young and in love and I was in this cool band that had transfixed me from the first time I had heard them. It felt like I was on a magic carpet ride.\u201d</p> <p>That ride, which was more roller coaster from hell than magic carpet, is the most enthralling section of her memoir, coming after her troubled childhood in Los Angeles and before her second great doomed romance with the classical violinist <a href=\"http://www.nigelkennedy.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Nigel Kennedy</a>, who, though not a born contrarian like Smith, has an ego and controlling streak to match his. She describes Kennedy as \u201ca cross between Amadeus Mozart and Keith Moon\u201d and tells me he once tried to roll over his car for kicks while she and her mother were passengers. It\u2019s that kind of book: full of outlandish, occasionally alarming anecdotes that vividly evoke her wild, impulsive youth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"195f1a4df0c844ee67dc6400a91321f73d9e3ebd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/195f1a4df0c844ee67dc6400a91321f73d9e3ebd/0_462_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"mark e smith and brix 1985\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brix Smith Start with Mark E Smith, circa 1985: \u2018We loved each other and made magic together.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lisa Haun/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I meet Brix Smith Start, as she is now known, in her local cafe near Old Street, east London. Now 53, and happily married to Philip Start, a fashion entrepreneur who once owned the Woodhouse chain, she retains the boundless enthusiasm of a Californian teenager. She talks as she writes, in flurries of excited eagerness followed by moments of semi-reflection, and her speech is peppered with therapy speak and new age philosophy \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve always been super-guided about things, intuitively and spiritually.\u201d For all that, she is hugely entertaining company.</p> <p>\u201cIt took 15 years of cooking,\u201d she says of the memoir. \u201cI needed to find a voice and to be honest and to write it with love. I didn\u2019t want to be bitter or\u00a0spiteful.\u201d</p> <p>It begins in Disneyland with her first great love, Mickey Mouse, on whom she was fixated throughout her childhood. It was, she says, the most enjoyable part to write, not least because she used \u201ca technique of sense memory, self-hypnosis and deep meditation that\u00a0meant I could go back and put myself into situations where I could smell what was cooking and feel the texture of the clothes I was\u00a0wearing.\u201d</p> <p>She was born Laura Elisse Salenger in 1962, and her parents, Lucy and Steve, divorced before she was two. Her mother worked for CBS Television, leaving her in the care of their Mexican maid, Carmen, who was \u201cmean\u201d, often depositing her in her cot for hours with\u00a0the central heating on max. Sometimes, she went to the CBS studio and watched from the wings, \u201centranced\u201d as Sonny &amp; Cher rehearsed their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwubvgLrtew\" title=\"\">weekly programme</a>. \u201cI learned the work ethic early from watching Cher on her show,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Occasionally, too, she went to stay with her father, a neurotic and distant Beverly Hills psychiatrist with whom she was \u201cbesotted\u201d, and his Swedish girlfriend.

I went to see him play a few weeks ago. And it was great, we locked eyes and he came over and hugged me and wept on my shoulder. There is a deep bond, but his life is\u00a0crazy.\u201d</p> <p>You can certainly pick them, I say. She nods. \u201cI do think my relationship with my father is key. He was a controlling, mercurial genius and a larger-than-life personality. I was looking for men to love me that were in the mould of my father because I wanted my father to love me. Once that was identified, the pattern could be\u00a0broken.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4987da14552dcdcae2298d5a8cb247d5b261a06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4987da14552dcdcae2298d5a8cb247d5b261a06/0_0_5364_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brix Smith Start photographed in London last week by Richard Saker for the Observer New Review.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"716\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brix Smith Start photographed in London last week by Richard Saker for the Observer New Review.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few years ago, her aunt called to tell her that her father was in hospital and close to death. She had not spoken to him in years, though it was not for the want of trying on her part. \u201cBy then, I had realised that whatever was\u00a0going on with him, was about him\u00a0and not me. His pain was his pain and I had never done anything to cause\u00a0it. Once I stepped back and saw\u00a0that, I could forgive him.\u201d</p> <p>Did she call him?

It\u00a0was very much a long, making-peace conversation. Later, I heard that he had sobbed for three days.\u201d Well, at least you made peace with him before he died, I say, sensing she may be on the verge of sobbing herself. \u201cNo!\u201d she shrieks. \u201cHe survived.\u201d She shakes her head as if still in disbelief. \u201cAnd, did he\u00a0call me back ever since that?

      "bodyText": "A federal anti-corruption body would save millions of dollars in federal funding, restore public confidence and play an important educative role, according to Dio Wang, the chair of the Senate committee looking into the establishment of such a body. \u201cThe commission would play an educational role in preventing corruption in the first instance, saving potential hundreds of millions of federal funds, but perhaps almost as importantly would restore public confidence in federal politics,\u201d Wang said. The Senate select committee on the establishment of a national integrity commission is expected to bring down its interim report on Monday, the day before the budget. It has held only two hearings but the committee is expected to be cut short by a double-dissolution election. \u201cThe committee had just begun taking evidence on how a national integrity commission might be structured,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWe had just started to delve into this level of detail yet an early election will cut that short.\u201d Neither of the major parties support an integrity commission and when the matter was debated in the Senate, the attorney general, George Brandis, said in Australia, federal public administration and politics had been \u201cremarkably free of corruption\u201d. But Labor eventually supported the establishment of the committee, during the debate over the Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC) bill. The Attorney General\u2019s Department told the inquiry there were already strong \u201cmultifaceted\u201d measures in place at a federal level to fight corruption. \u201cThe Australian government does not support a national integrity commission,\u201d \u201cThe Australian government\u2019s approach to dealing with corruption is integrated and multifaceted. We work to get the standards and training right, assess risk and detect, investigate and respond to corruption.\u201d But Prof AJ Brown, who specialises in public policy at Griffith University, told the committee that there were big gaps in jurisdictions between agencies that dealt with corrupt behaviour. \u201cThere is something of a regime that governs APS agencies, but, when it comes to non-criminal and a broader comprehensive approach to corruption risks, we have to recognise that Australian public service agencies only account for around half, if you are lucky, of total commonwealth public sector activity and agencies,\u201d Brown told the committee. \u201cThere is a huge issue around having a coordinated system that works right across the whole of the commonwealth. \u201cThat is without going close to parliamentary and political integrity, to political finance risks and to all the other aspects of corruption that really worry the community, just as if not more powerfully than the types of corruption problems that occur within the public service or law enforcement or at the coalface.\u201d Transparency International Australia\u2019s (TIA) submission favoured a broad-based federal corruption agency which would be part of a multi-agency strategy. TIA also called for an overhaul of legal definitions of corruption across the states and the commonwealth to make them \u201csimpler, nationally consistent, and more comprehensive\u201d. \u201cMost federal agencies\u2019 anti-corruption efforts continue to go unsupervised (other than clear criminal conduct reported to the AFP), including around half of the total federal public sector not in the jurisdiction of the Australian Public Service Commission,\u201d the TIA submission said. \u201cThere are no independent mechanisms supporting federal parliamentary integrity (other than AFP investigations into criminal conduct); \u201cCorruption prevention, risk assessment and monitoring activities are patchy and uncoordinated; and the criminal law enforcement focus of the AFP fraud and anti-corruption centre, while important, includes foreign bribery, anti-money laundering and other criminal cases, and cannot provide the necessary oversight of \u2018softer\u2019 or \u2018grey area\u2019 corruption investigation and prevention activity across the federal sector.\u201d But the Rule of Law Institute (ROLI) and the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) both opposed the formation of a federal anti-corruption body. \u201cIt creates a parallel system of justice to the traditional criminal court system, initially with all the credibility of a court, but without any of the protections that have been built up around the court system over many generations, including the presumption of innocence, the high standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, and the privilege against self- incrimination,\u201d the ROLI submission said. IPA director of policy Simon Breheny told the committee \u201cthe defining features of state anti-corruption agencies are the systematic breach of fundamental legal rights, including the presumption of innocence and the right to silence; a lack of transparency and oversight; and a disregard for the process and procedures adhered to by ordinary courts, including the rules of evidence\u201d. All Australian states now have broad-based anti-corruption agencies; the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac), the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission, the Western Australia Corruption and Crime Commission, the Tasmanian Integrity Commission, the Victorian Independent Broad- based Anti-corruption Commission (Ibac) and the South Australia Independent Commissioner Against Corruption. The Northern Territory government announced it would set up an anti-corruption body this year. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 May 2016 to replace the reference to the SA Office of Public Integrity with the SA Independent Commissioner Against Corruption.",

      "bodyText": "With his propaganda-poster jawline and air of unimpeachable nobility, Captain America (Chris Evans) has always been one of the duller members of the Marvel universe. Which is probably why, although this latest Avengers outing bears his name, the film-makers have press-ganged (almost) every spare ounce of Marvel muscle to back him up. The Hulk-sized gap in the lineup is filled by an engagingly geeky Spider-Man (Tom Holland, a promising taster for the stand-alone Spider-Movie next year). And while memorising who is in which of the colour-coded, armour-plated exoskeletons (and who is punching who in the head) can be challenging, the sheer force of so much superpowered personality on screen makes for a blast of a movie. Following an explosive but raggedly edited opening sequence in Nigeria, the Avengers are forced to confront the human cost of their ambitious action set pieces. Guilt over collateral damage is what prompts some of them \u2013 Tony Stark, Natasha Romanoff \u2013 to sign an accord ceding responsibility for their actions to the UN. But Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, demurs. The freedom to deploy a spot of unilateral ass-kicking where needed is what makes the Captain, and by extension America, great. The scene is set for an internecine Avengers smackdown; the plot \u2013 hooked on an undercooked vengeful grudge \u2013 is of secondary importance to the opportunity to watch them knock titanium alloy spots off each other. Fortunately, the zinging screenplay, by Marvel regulars Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, hits home almost as frequently as the punches.",

      "body": "<p>With his propaganda-poster jawline and air of unimpeachable nobility, Captain America (Chris Evans) has always been one of the duller members of the Marvel universe. Which is probably why, although this latest Avengers outing bears his name, the film-makers have press-ganged (almost) every spare ounce of Marvel muscle to back him up. The Hulk-sized gap in the lineup is filled by an engagingly geeky Spider-Man (Tom Holland, a promising taster for the stand-alone Spider-Movie next year). And while memorising who is in which of the colour-coded, armour-plated exoskeletons (and who is punching who in the head) can be challenging, the sheer force of so much superpowered personality on screen makes for a blast of a movie.</p> \n<p>Following an explosive but raggedly edited opening sequence in Nigeria, the Avengers are forced to confront the human cost of their ambitious action set pieces. Guilt over collateral damage is what prompts some of them \u2013 Tony Stark, Natasha Romanoff \u2013 to sign an accord ceding responsibility for their actions to the UN. But Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, demurs. The freedom to deploy a spot of unilateral ass-kicking where needed is what makes the Captain, and by extension America, great. The scene is set for an internecine Avengers smackdown; the plot \u2013 hooked on an undercooked vengeful grudge \u2013 is of secondary importance to the opportunity to watch them knock titanium alloy spots off each other. Fortunately, the zinging screenplay, by Marvel regulars Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, hits home almost as frequently as the punches.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/apr/27/captain-america-civil-war-marvel-chris-evans-video-interview\" data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4tkak\" data-show-ads=\"true\" data-video-id=\"2494928\" data-video-name=\"Captain America's Chris Evans on realism in the superhero genre \u2013 video interview\" data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"> \n <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-572084f0e4b02c55b6401061\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> \n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/04/27/160426CaptAmericaJunketV2_desk.mp4\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/04/27/160426CaptAmericaJunketV2.m3u8\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/04/27/160426CaptAmericaJunketV2_large.3gp\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/04/27/160426CaptAmericaJunketV2_small.3gp\">\n  <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/04/27/160426CaptAmericaJunketV2_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"> \n </video> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/apr/27/captain-america-civil-war-marvel-chris-evans-video-interview\">Captain America\u2019s Chris Evans on realism in the superhero genre</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure>",

May Contain Food, created by the choreographer and director Luca Silvestrini, seats its audience at tables around the Place\u2019s performance space. There, we are \u201cserved\u201d by Protein\u2019s personable eight-strong cast, who dance and swoop around the room while delivering resistible appetisers (raw greens, cold rice) and idiosyncratic lyrics. We are invited to examine \u201cthe specials on the blackboard\u201d - there isn\u2019t a blackboard \u2013 before being served \u201can aperitif heritage fruit\u201d (a cherry tomato), which we are advised to roll into our eye-sockets, hold to our ears (\u201clisten to the tomato\u201d), then chew 21 times. Familiar phrases are intoned (\u201cgluten-free\u201d, \u201cguilt-free\u201d, \u201cresponsibly sourced\u201d), and food flies around the stage, most memorably in a demonstration of \u201cknife skills\u201d, which turns into manic and uncontrolled hacking. Individual foodstuffs are viciously denounced, with a cucumber described as \u201ca condom-wrapped piece of shit\u201d, and a processed food as \u201cthe bastard child of insecticide and corporate greed\u201d. Nor are vegetarians let off the hook, with one cast member angrily demanding to know why animals are not given the same love and space as free-range kale. This passage contains Silvestrini\u2019s most inventive choreography, with cast members brutally manhandling their lolling, squawking, dull-eyed colleagues as if delivering them for slaughter. As a chef sings an anthem extolling the joys of meat-eating, her body orgasmically swaying against a white backdrop, she leaves a broad blood smear. May Contain Food relates thematically to earlier works by Silvestrini, particularly The Big Sale (2005), which skewered hyper-consumerism, and Dear Body (2008), which took a satirical swipe at the cult of physical perfection. It\u2019s performed with great verve \u2013 Sonya Cullingford is outstanding, and the reliably fleet-footed Carl Harrison on fine, arch form \u2013 and Orlando Gough\u2019s score is splendidly, sonorously odd, with echoes of Corsican polyphony. But beyond charting the daftness of the food-fixated, which we\u2019ve all had ample opportunity to do for ourselves over the years, Silvestrini doesn\u2019t have a particular point to make, and the piece is just that bit too pleased with its own postmodern cleverness.

      "bodyText": "The comic actor Javone Prince, 35, grew up in west London and was awarded a full scholarship to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. Stage and TV work followed but his breakout role came in the E4 sitcom PhoneShop as the cocky salesman Jerwayne. His eponymous sketch show aired on BBC2 last summer and he has been nominated for best male comedy performance for it at next Sunday\u2019s Bafta awards. He\u2019s currently in The Suicide at the National Theatre and appears this month in Russell T Davies\u2019s BBC adaptation of A&nbsp;Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. Hi Javone. Where are you right now? Believe it or not, lying in bed. But you\u2019ll be pleased to know I\u2019m not naked. Phew. How did A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream come about? When I heard who else was in it \u2013 Maxine Peake, Nonso Anozie, a very diverse cast \u2013 it sounded exciting. When I got offered the role of Snug, the joiner, I jumped at the chance. You\u2019re something of a Shakespearean veteran, aren\u2019t you? My first ever job was understudying at the RSC. Back at drama school, teachers told me I was really good at Shakespeare. I love music and rhyme, and iambic pentameter is so rhythmic. Were you a fan of Russell T Davies\u2019s work before? He\u2019s a fantastic talent. I watched Cucumber, Banana and Tofu last year and thought, Wow, I\u2019d love to work with him. He\u2019s got a smart, fresh way of thinking about TV. He was on set every day, constantly creating new things to bring to it. Snug does lots of lion roaring. Did you go to the zoo for research? I did visit London zoo but didn\u2019t see any lions. Luckily, YouTube exists. You play one of the rude mechanicals in the play, alongside Richard Wilson and Matt Lucas. How was it working with them? One Foot in the Grave was one of the shows that made me want to get into comedy and I was a big fan of Little Britain, so it was surreal to be working with them. I made sure I didn\u2019t do their catchphrases at them, although I was tempted. Me and Matt are both Arsenal fans, so that was the icebreaker. Maxine Peake has a strong look as the fairy queen Titania\u2026 Yeah, a mohawk with tattoos on the sides of her head. She might have looked fierce but was one of the kindest, friendliest people. And Elaine Paige plays Mistress Quince. Surely she gets to sing? Of course she does. We got her to sing all the time on set. \u201cCome on, girl, when are you gonna start singing?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got a break \u2013 go on, quick song.\u201d You\u2019re starring in The Suicide at the National Theatre. How\u2019s it going? Tell you what I\u2019m stoked about: it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve done a play where people are tweeting me about it \u2013 posting their opinions or sneaky pics. It\u2019s great that a young audience are talking about theatre on Twitter in the way they talk about TV. It\u2019s the TV Baftas next Sunday. Been practising your gallant loser face just in case? I\u2019ve already perfected it. I start clapping and a gracious smile comes naturally. Look out for it on the TV. Presumably there\u2019ll be a second series of your sketch show? Hope so, we\u2019re waiting to find out. It\u2019d be a bit weird if we got Bafta nominated then didn\u2019t get recommissioned: \u201cSorry guys, well done but bye.\u201d Finally, were you affected by the death&nbsp;of your namesake Prince last&nbsp;week? Oh my gosh, completely. He was an icon for me growing up. I was living in a council house in the middle of nowhere and he brought magic into my life. Diamonds and Pearls was one of my first cassettes and I played it so much, I wore it out and glued it back together with nail varnish. Prince stood on his own. He inspired people to create stuff. He made the world a better place. A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream will be&nbsp;broadcast on BBC1 later this month&nbsp;",

      "bodyText": "The most immediately surprising feature of Kings of War is its absolute take-you-by-the-withered-arm clarity. After all, this is four-and-a-half hours of Shakespeare. In Dutch. With surtitles. Not a familiar play, either, but a mashing together of several of the histories. Ivo van Hove, the Belgian director of Toneelgroep Amsterdam, whose stripped-down production of A View from the Bridge made many of us see Arthur Miller in an entirely new light, has already produced a cycle of Shakespeare\u2019s Roman plays. Now he has brought together Richard III with Henry V and VI. Look at what has been cut, and it seems impossible that the result would be other than attenuated, crude. Jack Cade does not appear. The great women\u2019s parts (surely due to be put together in their own cycle of plays) are memorably, meticulously delivered but the scabrous curses are stripped down. The rhythm and rich phrasing of many of the most familiar speeches are flattened into sur-titlese. You don\u2019t get the full tumbling Shakespeare, reaching into nooks and niches. You get only one level of society. The rulers. Yet what a wonderful study of power this is. A fluorescently lit scything of the plays. At each point Van Hove justifies his transplanting of the action into the 21st century. Set in map rooms, hospitals and glacial minimal palaces, with video running throughout, the tactical manoeuvring, the backstabbing, the waging of war as a way of distracting from domestic confusion all look completely modern. There is no stinting on the horror. On screen and on stage there is enthusiastic assassination by injection and suffocation. Yet the movement is stealthy. Seen in video close-up, faces clench and relax but never spasm. Once more unto the breach is delivered not as a rant but as a strategic policy broadcast. Henry V\u2019s wooing of Katherine is staged like a really sticky blind date, with the prince dropping the cutlery. The steely force of this is in sharp contrast to the Wars of the Roses compilation revived last year, by Trevor Nunn, with full-on smoke and roaring. Van Hove is showing us a new Shakespearean future. One of them, anyway. \u2022 Kings of War is at the Barbican, London until 1 May",

      "body": "<p>The most immediately surprising feature of<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.barbican.org.uk/theatre/event-detail.asp?ID=17991\"><strong>Kings of War</strong></a> is its absolute take-you-by-the-withered-arm clarity. After all, this is four-and-a-half hours of Shakespeare. In Dutch. With surtitles. Not a familiar play, either, but a mashing together of several of the histories. Ivo van Hove, the Belgian director of Toneelgroep Amsterdam, whose stripped-down production of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/17/view-from-the-bridge-review-ivo-van-hove-arthur-miller\"><em>A View from the Bridge</em></a> made many of us see Arthur Miller in an entirely new light, has already produced a cycle of Shakespeare\u2019s Roman plays. Now he has brought together<em> Richard III</em> with <em>Henry V</em> and <em>VI</em>.</p> <p>Look at what has been cut, and it seems impossible that the result would be other than attenuated, crude. Jack Cade does not appear. The great women\u2019s parts (surely due to be put together in their own cycle of plays) are memorably, meticulously delivered but the scabrous curses are stripped down. The rhythm and rich phrasing of many of the most familiar speeches are flattened into sur-titlese. You don\u2019t get the full tumbling Shakespeare, reaching into nooks and niches. You get only one level of society. The rulers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The manoeuvring, backstabbing, and waging of war as distraction from domestic confusion all look completely modern</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet what a wonderful study of power this is. A fluorescently lit scything of the plays. At each point Van Hove justifies his transplanting of the action into the 21st century. Set in map rooms, hospitals and glacial minimal palaces, with video running throughout, the tactical manoeuvring, the backstabbing, the waging of war as a way of distracting from domestic confusion all look completely modern.</p> <p>There is no stinting on the horror. On screen and on stage there is enthusiastic assassination by injection and suffocation. Yet the movement is stealthy. Seen in video close-up, faces clench and relax but never spasm. Once more unto the breach is delivered not as a rant but as a strategic policy broadcast. Henry V\u2019s wooing of Katherine is staged like a really sticky blind date, with the prince dropping the cutlery. The steely force of this is in sharp contrast to the <em>Wars of the Roses</em> compilation revived last year, by Trevor Nunn, with full-on smoke and roaring. Van Hove is showing us a new Shakespearean future. One of them, anyway.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.barbican.org.uk/theatre/event-detail.asp?id=17991&amp;pg=7807\"><em>\u2022 </em>Kings of War is at the Barbican, London until 1 May</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Sometimes, the best way to get the most out of the classroom is to leave it and take learning outside. Outdoor learning can make for happier, healthier, well-rounded students \u2013 particularly for those with special educational needs (SEN). Sulivan primary school in Fulham, London, a maintained school where 30% of pupils have SEN, set up a \u201creading forest\u201d for its youngest students. \u201cWe are always looking at innovative ideas to engage all pupils and children with SEN sometimes need more active, out-of-the-box ideas,\u201d says Emily Genochio, year 2 teacher and inclusion manager at the school. \u201cReading outdoors is enjoyable, stress-relieving and calming for pupils.\u201d Children can find books \u201cgrowing\u201d in the trees and tents beneath the branches, where they can read quietly and share books. Those with social, emotional and mental health SEN \u2013 some of whom don\u2019t normally enjoy reading \u2013 are more eager to get outside into the reading forest, says Genochio, and for students on the autism spectrum, it provides a quiet, open space. The outdoors also provides a new setting to take on challenges, and learn life skills without even realising it. \u201cOur children with SEN benefit from how the outdoors relieves stress and anxiety, develops social skills, motivates learning across the curriculum (and beyond) and allows them to be practical, responsible and productive members of the community,\u201d explains Genochio. The school has a large outdoor space, which also includes a wildlife garden, vegetable plot, pond, insect hotel and meadow area. But activities don\u2019t have to be over-engineered or contrived, says Genochio, who uses the example of her students rolling back a log to expose the creepy crawlies underneath. \u201cThere is a sense of achievement in meeting a challenge \u2013 and students take that confidence to succeed in other situations in the classroom and beyond.\u201d The potential for outdoor education to foster independence is particularly beneficial for SEN students, according to Andrew Colley, lecturer in special education at the Cass School of Education and Communities, University of East London. \u201cSEN students have often learned helplessness and passivity because, consciously or not, we as practitioners exert a huge amount of control and [going outdoors] forces us to relinquish that,\u201d he explains. \u201cGiving SEN students that feeling of space, and the sensory stimulation that comes with being outdoors, is absolutely vital.\u201d Regency high school in Worcester \u2013 where students have a broad range of medical, physical and learning needs \u2013 also uses the outdoors to combine firing creativity and enhancing learning, with building the independence and wellbeing of pupils. Every other year students from the school take part in the RHS Malvern Spring Festival. Last year students interpreted the \u201croute to the hills\u201d theme to create a Roman garden, complete with a mini fort. \u201cGardening is so levelling for students with special needs, it\u2019s very inclusive,\u201d says Sarah Rudge, a teacher at the school. \u201cIt takes a long time to see things develop and grow, but having patience is a really good life skill,\u201d she adds. While some children will concentrate on digging earth and planting seeds, others will be calculating the dimensions of the garden or researching which herbs the Romans grew and what vegetables they ate. The project ties in lots of different disciplines \u2013 from design technology to science and history. At the festival itself, the children interact with the crowd of thousands passing by, and present their work to an audience. One student, who uses a wheelchair, made his way to the centre of the path, where he handed out the leaflets his class had made about the project. \u201cThis child, who doesn\u2019t speak, used his initiative to engage the audience in talking to him and looked through the portfolio to show them photos of what he had been involved in,\u201d explains Rudge. Elsewhere, students thoughtfully recalled what they had done and talked about the garden to lots of people, growing visibly more confident and enthusiastic as time went on. Outdoor activity requires students to adapt to unpredictable weather and the changing seasons, and this can be another positive challenge, says Dr John Crosbie, former director of UK charity the Calvert Trust, which provides outdoor activities for people with disabilities. \u201cThe ability to try and relate to situations is a real challenge for children on the autism spectrum, and so is being flexible with their view of order, timescales and routine; being outdoors challenges this,\u201d he explains. For outdoor learning to be effective for SEN students, however, thought needs to be put into how to structure the space, says Felicity Robinson, a landscape architect and teacher who wrote Naturally Inclusive \u2013 a new approach to design for play \u2013 for UK charity Learning Through Landscapes. Robinson uses an example of an outdoor space she designed which had the \u201cquieter zones\u201d near the exit from the classroom with a sandpit, a growing garden, small world, role play and big-scale painting area. The children could then transition to the busier, more active zones farther out with bike riding, ball games and climbing. \u201cThis gave the zones clarity of purpose to support the children more effectively, with the opportunity to acclimatise and avoid disturbance in the quieter zones,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd it enabled the children to focus more effectively on the activity in hand.\u201d It is important to get children involved in creating their outdoor space as much as possible too. After being involved in creating an outdoor learning space at their school, one key stage 2 SEN student told Robinson: \u201cI felt happy because I took part and someone else didn\u2019t just do the work for me. It would have made me cross and disappointed to find it had changed over the holiday and we hadn\u2019t done it ourselves.\u201d It is also important to make outdoor learning a different and complementary experience to what happens in the classroom. Think natural colours, plants, seasonal change, natural materials and logs, leaves and twigs as loose parts for construction and role play. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t just be a case of taking the indoors out \u2013 think about what is special about the outside and capitalise on that.\u201d The green schools series is supported by the WWF.

The children could then transition to the busier, more active zones farther out with bike riding, ball games and climbing. </p> <p>\u201cThis gave the zones clarity of purpose to support the children more effectively, with the opportunity to acclimatise and avoid disturbance in the quieter zones,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd it enabled the children to focus more effectively on the activity in hand.\u201d</p> <p>It is important to get children involved in creating their outdoor space as much as possible too. After being involved in creating an outdoor learning space at their school, one key stage 2 SEN student told Robinson: \u201cI felt happy because I took part and someone else didn\u2019t just do the work for me. It would have made me cross and disappointed to find it had changed over the holiday and we hadn\u2019t done it ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>It is also important to make outdoor learning a different and complementary experience to what happens in the classroom. Think natural colours, plants, seasonal change, natural materials and logs, leaves and twigs as loose parts for construction and role play. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t just be a case of taking the indoors out \u2013 think about what is special about the outside and capitalise on that.\u201d</p> <h2>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/green-schools\">green schools series</a> is supported by the <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WWF</a>.

      "bodyText": "When, during the coalition government, Michael Gove introduced free schools, part of the idea was that they could go almost anywhere \u2013 converted office buildings, for example. Previous school-building programmes were accused of grandiose extravagance, of being ego trips by lordly architects at the expense of the public purse. Space standards \u2013 the minimum permitted dimensions for classrooms, corridors and suchlike \u2013 were shrunk. The message was that spaces of learning don\u2019t matter much, that teachers teach children, not buildings. So it is striking that with at least one free school, the Hackney New School in east London, its architects Henley Halebrown Rorrison are nonetheless striving to exceed the basic functional minimum with its architecture. They are doing so in extremely challenging circumstances. In particular they have to deal with the government\u2019s demand that the making of schools has to be put in the power of large construction companies that show little sign of caring for ideals of education, the environments in which children grow up, the reasonable wishes of teachers, or anything much beyond getting away with the shabbiest possible building at the best possible price. HNS describes itself as a mixed-ability school with a music specialism, which means that every pupil has to take lessons in at least one instrument. It was founded by a corporate financier, Andreas Wesemann, a violinist, Sophie Solomon, an architect, Andrew Tetlow, and Phillippa De\u2019Ath, the CEO of an education technology company. All highly educated local residents and parents of young children in need of schooling, they wanted others to have the \u201cwonderful\u201d education that they had enjoyed, says the school\u2019s head, Lesley Falconer. This is the free school ideal as Gove and his advisers meant it to be: motivated, resourceful, privileged and often successful parents creating an institution of high aspirations for the benefit not only of their own children but of others from a wide range of backgrounds. The demographics of modern Hackney, where council estates combine with new zones of high-value housing, make it fertile ground for such a project. The site is squeezed between a busy road and a canal basin, fronted with an old wharfmaster\u2019s house and ornamental fragments of the wharf\u2019s wall and gateway. A former telephone exchange, rear and off-centre, has been converted into classrooms. There are two new blocks: a five-storey \u201ctower\u201d on the road side that houses offices and, on its top two levels, art rooms; and a six-storey \u201cwarehouse\u201d backing on to the canal that includes classrooms, the assembly hall and space for practising music. Metal bridges connect the rear block to the old exchange. It is the sort of site that would otherwise have been filled to capacity with blocks of luxury waterfront apartments. Instead, says Simon Henley of HHbR, they saw \u201can opportunity to break the uniformity\u201d of the \u201chomogenous residential-led schemes\u201d and \u201crespond to the surrounding townscape and listed buildings to make a new piece of the city that has an identifiable character as well as providing social infrastructure\u201d. What this means in practice is a grouping of the blocks with consideration to each other and to their neighbours, and the hollowing out of enough play space in the centre to include a basketball court. On the canal side the sheer elevation aims for the robust-but-handsome quality of old wharf buildings, and slopes its flanks in response to the gables of existing structures. It is a bit Hanseatic, slightly Chicagoan. On the street side the blocks advance and recede, and the window sizes vary in response to the uses inside, bigger for art rooms and smaller for offices. The virtues are necessarily simple \u2013 generous glazing, decent ceiling heights in the classrooms, good proportions, plain detailing \u2013 and efforts are made to make the most of not very much. The metal connecting bridges, for example, are sized to be habitable additions to the external space, not just conduits for people. A stated model is the Victorian board school, the efficient but dignified type that appeared in large numbers across British cities following the introduction of universal education in 1870. It comes, however, without the ornamental trimmings that Victorian budgets and building skills were able to add. The speed of design and construction was fast. Some classrooms, in the converted exchange, had to be in use within six months of the appointment of the architects. The budget was tight, to the extent that the architects shrank the buildings below the sizes in the brief, in order to make it affordable. They could do this by making the circulation spaces as efficient as possible, which was in turn enabled by the \u201chome room\u201d idea of teaching, whereby teachers rather than pupils move from one classroom to another between breaks. The toughest struggle, however, and one that was not completely won, came from the Department for Education\u2019s insistence from the outset that the school work with the contractors Willmott Dixon, which would then call the shots. There is a contradiction here: if free schools are supposed to be about bottom-up initiatives by committed individuals, they are subjected to a top-down demand that the building work is done by large and unresponsive corporate organisations. It means that communication between client, architects and builders is minimised, for fear of introducing a further element of the unpredictable and therefore risk into the process. Big modern construction companies are less concerned with building well themselves, than with organising sub-contractors to do the actual work, and pushing them as hard as possible to do the most for least payment. The result, at Hackney New School, are details that should deeply embarrass Willmott Dixon, but probably won\u2019t. Surfaces in places of high traffic, such as stairs and corridors, are of a kind that already look much the worse for wear and tear. Materials are not so much joined or aligned as find themselves in approximate proximity to each other. In places the building looks unfinished, as if the no doubt harassed workman simply gave up. On leaving the playground to go to their classes, the children are welcomed by a porch that looks like a dim effort from a weak student in the design and technology class: gappy joints, a wonky-looking downpipe. The quality of workmanship is another departure from board schools, which were well made and durable. It also denies the professed values of free schools, such as pride, self-respect and respect for others, striving for the best and working hard to achieve a better future. The governors, teachers and architect show these qualities, and they are expected of the traditionally uniformed children, but they are not evident in much of the construction. Why insist on tie and blazer when the details are the equivalent of grubby jogging bottoms from Sports Direct? Willmott Dixon says: \u201cThe detailing,\u201d they say, \u201cwas completed to a high standard within the budget constraints and we worked to the specifications of the architect.\u201d Gove and his government loved blaming architects and seemed to adhere to an outdated stereotype of a nitwit in a bow-tie imposing absurd theories on honest workmen and naive clients. The reality now is that many architects are badly paid and overworked, but care more than most about the finished product and its users. The architecture of Hackney Free School extracts about as much as could be expected from the near-impossible conditions of its making, but it is time that the contractors responsible for public buildings were subjected to as much scepticism and scrutiny as their designers.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Three young dancers are preening, twirling and gliding through the marble canyons of the Duveen galleries at Tate Britain. Every now and again they pause in order to strike some exaggerated pose. It might be a weak wrist to the forehead, as if receiving shocking news, or a flighty twist of the hip that suggests utter nonchalance in the face of so many gaping passersby, surprised to find their route to the pre-Raphaelites or conceptualists interrupted by a trio of ballet dancers on manoeuvres. The spectacle ranges from full camp to classical froideur. Which is exactly as it should be given the immense stage set created for their performance. At one end of the Duveens, as they are known, is a colossal trompe l\u2019oeil panel that runs floor to ceiling and side to side so that it exactly fills the space which it depicts (at least if you turned the building inside out, or outside in). For the image shows the neoclassical facade of Tate Britain through which you have only just entered. But it is curiously adapted, so that the statue of Britannia no longer rules the waves of visitors coming up the steps \u2013 she\u2019s been deleted \u2013 and a number of new decorative details have been added that (very loosely) quote from the Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel, among others. At the other end of the Duveens is a second trompe l\u2019oeil experience showing the end of this very space, its magnificent sandstone columns now somehow combined with the facade of James Stirling\u2019s Clore gallery extension, built in the late 1980s. You will recognise that unlovely triangle of green window grids immediately. Not that they appear here in green, for they have been so fused with the design of the Duveen as to appear to become part of the golden neoclassical building: a hybrid of Victorian and postmodern architecture. But all this strangeness is taken even further by another architectural reference: the strafing, diagonal shadows seen in the febrile cityscapes of Giorgio de Chirico. Here is a post-po-mo conceit given an extra twist with an allusion to De Chirico\u2019s high-noon shadows. The effect is in perfect balance with the dancers\u2019 performance: classical and stylised in about equal measure. Historical Dances in an Antique Setting is exactly what you might expect from the Argentinian-born, London-based artist Pablo Bronstein. It is very much what he has done several times before. Bronstein is preoccupied with pre-modern European architecture and design, specifically the baroque and the neoclassical; he often creates live performances that take place inside these large architectural installations. Perhaps they are semi-satirical; perhaps they comment on the place and effect of architecture upon society, as curators like to say. Then again, perhaps they do not. Bronstein\u2019s drawings, for which he is most widely known, are subtle adjustments to what seem to be at first sight quite conventional architectural images \u2013 an \u201cetching\u201d of the Metropolitan Museum nearing completion that shows the building as some immense pharaonic monument in a desert of stones and waste, as if the rest of New York had never come into existence; the watercolour of a Victorian glasshouse mutating into a plate-glass skyrise currently on tour in British Art Show 8. I specially like his Erecting of the Paternoster Square Column, in which that towering Corinthian column, topped with its blazing faux urn, is being erected using an enormous wooden contraption, to the wonder of Lilliputian bystanders below. The drawing appears to be 18th century. The column was installed in 2001. But the punning humour of these drawings hasn\u2019t translated so well to the grand stage of the Duveen galleries. Bronstein\u2019s wit reveals itself best on a small scale, when you have to peer into the image to discover his spry conceits. It is true that some people find the dancers at Tate Britain mildly humorous; and it is true that they perform a kind of sight gag, not least because their costumes \u2013 black leggings, red jerseys and ropes of outsize pearls \u2013 feel like a throwback to the 1980s, era of Lady Di and the Clore extension. This is also the era of voguing, and sure enough the dancers are going through the poses with mannered solemnity. But they are also imitating the sprezzatura of the Renaissance aristocrat who has read Castiglione\u2019s famous The Book of the Courtier. Sprezzatura was once about effortless grace, though by the 18th century it had turned into parodic mincing; yet it was also a source for classical ballet. So the references pile up, on paper at least; what\u2019s authentic and what is artificial, what\u2019s new and what is merely reprise. Some of what\u2019s going on is fairly obvious \u2013 the dancers are creating 3D drawings (at one point, the white floor tape they are following shapes itself into the blueprint of a baroque garden) just as the massive facades also operate as drawings. But the back of each structure is openly revealed as raw plywood and somehow the elements never cleave together as they might. It is good to be reminded of the inherent theatricality of these pillared spaces, and the architectural mishmash that is Tate Britain. But this spectacle is deliberately self-limiting. It has the stylised aestheticism of a Peter Greenaway film, and the pleasures are similarly slim.",

Every now and again they pause in order to strike some exaggerated pose. It might be a weak wrist to the forehead, as if receiving shocking news, or a flighty twist of the hip that suggests utter nonchalance in the face of so many gaping passersby, surprised to find their route to the pre-Raphaelites or conceptualists interrupted by a trio of ballet dancers on manoeuvres. The spectacle ranges from full camp to classical froideur.</p> <p>Which is exactly as it should be given the immense stage set created for their performance. At one end of the <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/search?f%5B%5D=im_vid_31:1209\">Duveens</a>, as they are known, is a colossal trompe l\u2019oeil panel that runs floor to ceiling and side to side so that it exactly fills the space which it depicts (at least if you turned the building inside out, or outside in). For the image shows the neoclassical facade of Tate Britain through which you have only just entered. But it is curiously adapted, so that the statue of Britannia no longer rules the waves of visitors coming up the steps \u2013 she\u2019s been deleted \u2013 and a number of new decorative details have been added that (very loosely) quote from the Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel, among others.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bronstein\u2019s wit reveals itself best on a small scale, when you have to\u00a0peer into the image to discover his spry conceits</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the other end of the Duveens is a second trompe l\u2019oeil experience showing the end of this very space, its magnificent sandstone columns now somehow combined with the facade of James Stirling\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.architecture.com/Explore/ArchitecturalStyles/Postmodernism.aspx\">Clore gallery extension</a>, built in the late 1980s. You will recognise that unlovely triangle of green window grids immediately. Not that they appear here in green, for they have been so fused with the design of the Duveen as to appear to become part of the golden neoclassical building: a hybrid of Victorian and postmodern architecture.</p> <p>But all this strangeness is taken even further by another architectural reference: the strafing, diagonal shadows seen in the febrile cityscapes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/jan/26/1\">Giorgio de Chirico</a>. Here is a post-po-mo conceit given an extra twist with an allusion to De Chirico\u2019s high-noon shadows. The effect is in perfect balance with the dancers\u2019 performance: classical and stylised in about equal measure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a158869ae8b4cf3ba1f9ee24f70f915fc60384ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a158869ae8b4cf3ba1f9ee24f70f915fc60384ff/0_336_2725_3593/758.jpg\" alt=\"Historical Dances in an Antique Setting 2016\" width=\"758\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Historical Dances, with a trompe l\u2019oeil of Tate Britain\u2019s fa\u00e7ade in the background.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brotherton/Lock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/pablo-bronstein-historical-dances-antique-setting\">Historical Dances in an Antique Setting</a></em> is exactly what you might expect from the Argentinian-born, London-based artist <a href=\"http://www.heraldst.com/pablo-bronstein/\">Pablo Bronstein</a>. It is very much what he has done several times before. Bronstein is preoccupied with pre-modern European architecture and design, specifically the baroque and the neoclassical; he often creates live performances that take place inside these large architectural installations. Perhaps they are semi-satirical; perhaps they comment on the place and effect of architecture upon society, as curators like to say. Then again, perhaps they do not.</p> <p>Bronstein\u2019s drawings, for which he is most widely known, are subtle adjustments to what seem to be at first sight quite conventional architectural images \u2013 an \u201cetching\u201d of the <a href=\"http://www.flashartonline.com/article/pablo-bronstein/\">Metropolitan Museum</a> nearing completion that shows the building as some immense pharaonic monument in a desert of stones and waste, as if the rest of New York had never come into existence; the watercolour of a Victorian glasshouse mutating into a plate-glass skyrise currently on tour in <a href=\"http://britishartshow8.com/artists/pablo-bronstein-1496\">British Art Show 8</a>.</p> <p>I specially like his <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/bronstein-erecting-of-the-paternoster-square-column-t12782\"><em>Erecting of the Paternoster Square Column</em></a>, in which that towering Corinthian column, topped with its blazing faux urn, is being erected using an enormous wooden contraption, to the wonder of Lilliputian bystanders below. The drawing appears to be 18th century. The column was installed in 2001.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The costumes \u2013 black leggings, red jerseys and ropes of outsize pearls \u2013 feel like a throwback to the 1980s</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the punning humour of these drawings hasn\u2019t translated so well to the grand stage of the Duveen galleries.

Elegy, slighter but needling, also has love and medical science at its centre. It also moves in an investigative manner, curling backwards. Yet things have shifted. This is absolutely a play of today. All the better for that. The very fine cast is all female and not young. Only last year \u2013 before Caryl Churchill\u2019s Escaped Alone \u2013 this would have caused a stir. The love is homosexual: that\u2019s no longer a cause for comment. The subject is loss of memories. The Father has demonstrated \u2013 or reminded, us since King Lear got there first \u2013 how wonderfully suited the stage is to expressing a failing mind. Payne\u2019s is a dilemma drama, set in the near future. A teacher in her mid-60s has a degenerative disease. Her decline can be arrested by surgical intervention, but the result will be a catastrophic loss of memory. The last 25 years of her life, the period she has spent with her partner, will disappear from her mind. This is more than a debating point. The choice raises the question of what makes an individual. It is, explains the doctor, a life-saving procedure. To which the patient responds: \u201cWhat life? If it isn\u2019t saving this life.\u201d Barbara Flynn, far too seldom seen on stage, suggests with beautiful restraint the watchful care the couple had for each other. As the partner who will be forgotten, she holds herself together in desolation. Captivating Zo\u00eb Wanamaker, going from wild to comical in her inside-out dressing gown, shows glimmers of what she was as she looks towards a blanker, healthy future. In the least developed part, of the doctor, subtle Nina Sosanya delivers the monstrous choice without making herself seem monstrous. The rapt quality of Josie Rourke\u2019s production is enhanced by Tom Scutt\u2019s design. Simple but revealing. In the middle, a floor to ceiling tree cleft in two. When the lights go down, the split in the trunk glows. As life becomes murkier, smoke fills the space around it. \u2022 At the Donmar Warehouse, London, until 18 June",

      "bodyText": "I was 11 years old when Jonathan Cott first brought a gun to school. It was bright red, or maybe dark blue \u2013 colours tend to fade first in the memory \u2013 and the paint was chipped at the corners. Cotty, as we called him, was always in deluxe kinds of trouble. Once, while we sat at our desks awaiting the arrival of a long-suffering English teacher, Cotty balanced a large cardboard box on the frame of the classroom door. When the teacher entered, the box fell over his head, trapping his arms in such a way that it took a good 15 seconds for the man to unsheathe himself by bobbing his head back and forth, fellatially. Cotty\u2019s gun fired potatoes, or, to be more precise, tiny chunks of potato. To reload the gun he\u2019d simply plunge the barrel into a King Edward that he carried in his left hand, before squeezing off a shot. Potato fired from a spud gun hurts a lot more than you\u2019d think \u2013 especially if it manages to find its way toward a budding bollock. At 11 years old I witnessed the mysterious power of the gun, and the way in which it transfers that power, instantly and sometimes irresistibly, to its holder. Video game designers become familiar with this power early into their careers. The virtual gun is the most useful tool in the game designer\u2019s box. Nothing better extends our reach into the television screen, granting, with a click and a phut, the ability to affect objects both near and far. Virtual guns make us feel powerful, suddenly and in illicit ways. Change the class of gun and you alter the game\u2019s pace and rhythm. Shotguns require thought and intimacy. Sniper rifles offer remote omniscience. Machine guns spray and niggle their targets, while you sprint about in frantic circles. In many blockbuster video games the gun nods away, stubbornly positioned centre screen, lending the appearance that the game world has been built around the totemic weapon. So prevalent is the digital gun that some arms manufacturers even license their weapons to game companies in the hope of an advertising opportunity. For all its promise of new kinds of digital adventuring, guns appear to be a central tool in the emerging world of virtual reality, too. Their usefulness has translated intact across mediums. Shooting guns is the primary interaction of many of the early VR gaming releases (although not all: the droll Job Simulator, for example, has you wielding a frying pan as a chef, or a spanner as a car mechanic). In one early game you must assemble a weapon from a clutter of glinting pieces laid out on a table in front of you, before using it against incoming enemies. One ad for HTC\u2019s Vive headset declares \u201cVR is here\u201d next to a photograph of a woman wearing the headset while shooting a virtual laser gun. So much for progress. And yet, while guns have lost none of their efficiency in translation, the act of shooting in virtual reality has gained a new impact. Firing a digital gun at a digital human feels inconsequential in most video games, where we remain cognisant that the violence is playful, not in earnest. \u201cVR breaks down that wall,\u201d Scott Stephan, an American VR game producer recently told me. \u201cDo I want to shoot people in VR? I really don\u2019t think so.\u201d BeAnotherLab, a research collective, believes that VR blurs the psychological line between fiction and reality so well that the medium could be employed by the military as a device for torture. The psychosomatic dangers of firing VR guns could finally dislodge the virtual weapon from its position of creative dominance in the games medium.",

When the teacher entered, the box fell over his head, trapping his arms in such a way that it took a good 15 seconds for the man to unsheathe himself by bobbing his head back and forth, fellatially.</p> <p>Cotty\u2019s gun fired potatoes, or, to be more precise, tiny chunks of potato. To reload the gun he\u2019d simply plunge the barrel into a King Edward that he carried in his left hand, before squeezing off a shot. Potato fired from a spud gun hurts a lot more than you\u2019d think \u2013 especially if it manages to find its way toward a budding bollock. At 11 years old I witnessed the mysterious power of the gun, and the way in which it transfers that power, instantly and sometimes irresistibly, to its holder.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>So prevalent is the digital gun that some arms manufacturers license their weapons to games companies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Video game designers become familiar with this power early into their careers. The virtual gun is the most useful tool in the game designer\u2019s box. Nothing better extends our reach into the television screen, granting, with a click and a phut, the ability to affect objects both near and far. Virtual guns make us feel powerful, suddenly and in illicit ways. Change the class of gun and you alter the game\u2019s pace and rhythm.</p> <p>Shotguns require thought and intimacy. Sniper rifles offer remote omniscience. Machine guns spray and niggle their targets, while you sprint about in frantic circles. In many blockbuster video games the gun nods away, stubbornly positioned centre screen, lending the appearance that the game world has been built around the totemic weapon. So prevalent is the digital gun that some arms manufacturers even license their weapons to game companies in the hope of an advertising opportunity.</p> <p>For all its promise of new kinds of digital adventuring, guns appear to be a central tool in the emerging world of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/06/virtual-reality-oculus-rift-headsets-david-foster-wallace\" title=\"\">virtual reality</a>, too. Their usefulness has translated intact across mediums. Shooting guns is the primary interaction of many of the early VR gaming releases (although not all: the droll <a href=\"http://jobsimulatorgame.com/\" title=\"\">Job Simulator</a>, for example, has you wielding a frying pan as a chef, or a spanner as a car mechanic). In one early game you must assemble a weapon from a clutter of glinting pieces laid out on a table in front of you, before using it against incoming enemies. One ad for <a href=\"https://www.htcvive.com/uk/\" title=\"\">HTC\u2019s Vive</a> headset declares \u201cVR is here\u201d next to a photograph of a woman wearing the headset while shooting a virtual laser gun. So much for progress.</p> <p>And yet, while guns have lost none of their efficiency in translation, the act of shooting in virtual reality has gained a new impact. Firing a digital gun at a digital human feels inconsequential in most video games, where we remain cognisant that the violence is playful, not in earnest. \u201cVR breaks down that wall,\u201d Scott Stephan, an American VR game producer recently told me. \u201cDo I want to shoot people in VR? I really don\u2019t think so.\u201d BeAnotherLab, a research collective, believes that VR blurs the psychological line between fiction and reality so well that the medium could be employed by the military as a <a href=\"https://versions.killscreen.com/we-should-be-talking-about-torture-in-vr/\" title=\"\">device for torture</a>. The psychosomatic dangers of firing VR guns could finally dislodge the virtual weapon from its position of creative dominance in the games medium.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "I had just finished this remarkable book and this review, when I heard of Jenny Diski\u2019s death on Thursday morning. Diski was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer in August 2014. The news prompted her to respond in the only way that had ever seemed meaningful to her, to write about it \u2013 and, once and for all, to tell the full, strange story of her writer\u2019s life, one that was linked fatefully to her having been taken in as a 15-year-old \u201cwaif\u201d by Doris Lessing. I had the privilege of talking to Diski about some of this not long after she started out on her journey into that past. She confessed, among other things, the born writer\u2019s guiltiest secret: that even the worst possible news lights a spark. In hearing her diagnosis, among her first thoughts had been that cancer might be \u201ca way of writing about Doris\u201d, an idea she had been stumped by since Lessing herself had died a year earlier. \u201cI was terribly excited to think I had a subject, or a project,\u201d she said, wrapped in a cashmere blanket in her front room in Cambridge, with due irony. She will, no doubt, have had a writer\u2019s sense of pride to have met her last deadline and seen her project&nbsp;published. The writing of In Gratitude has punctuated the long narrative of Diski\u2019s progressing illness, which was slowed but not defeated by sessions of chemotherapy and radiotherapy at Addenbroke\u2019s hospital. No detail of that gradual, brutal decline is overlooked in this story \u2013 Diski has a bone-dry matter-of-fact line in documenting the betrayals of her body, the humiliating falls, and \u201cmesh of steroid effects\u201d, her \u201cclot-headed\u201d hospice dreams. The middle section of the book is a clear-eyed meditation on modern mortality: \u201cI can\u2019t get into the car without waving an electric hand-held fan in my face and swigging on liquid morphine.\u201d Respite from that hard-to-endure present came in her no less forensic and determined untangling of the past. She was half-adopted, or fostered, or taken in by Lessing \u2013 she never really could explain their relationship \u2013 after she had escaped her estranged parents\u2019 dysfunctional and abusive attentions, first to a social-services sponsored place at a boarding school (from which she was expelled after falling for a local journalist) and then a period in a psychiatric hospital. While there, Lessing sent her a note out of the blue inviting her to come and live with her and her son Peter (who had known Diski a little, at least by reputation, as the \u201cwickedest girl\u201d at school). Diski was all set to take up a bed in a hostel in London, having found work in a shoe shop. In part, the \u201cgratitude\u201d of this book\u2019s title refers to that initial gesture from Lessing, if not always to what followed. She turned up like a fully fledged foundling: \u201cI knocked on the door, wearing an awful mustard-yellow woollen coat with a brown velvet collar and kind of pleated below and dropped waistline, which my mother thought was very grown up and respectable, and which I would never wear again.\u201d Lessing greeted her with a small kitten in her arms, \u201cLook, she can be your cat\u201d \u2013 an act of kindness unusual for its awkward simplicity in Diski\u2019s memory. The relationship between Lessing and Diski subsequently proved a kind of lifelong case study of complication and withholding, which this book nags at like a knot. For all the vaunted confessional honesty and socialist (and feminist) principle of her books the Nobel prize winner emerges as pathologically self-serving and self-absorbed, treating Diski (and almost everyone else who came to \u201csit at Doris\u2019s feet and gather wisdom\u201d) first as a kind of abstract project for improvement, then as a nuisance and a disgrace, and finally as literary&nbsp;material. When Diski arrived, Lessing had, she suggests, moved on from ideas of liberation through communism and sex, and was now in search of a \u201cmetaphysical education\u201d. Part of this was a determination to accept every obligation chance put in her way, not with love necessarily but with stoic fortitude. The foundling was part of this experiment. When Diski herself started to write, Lessing made her swear never to explore their relationship in print, but that didn\u2019t stop Lessing creating hardly fictionalised characters that detailed Diski\u2019s intimacies, and letting her know about it. In some ways, then, this book is a settling of scores, a setting of the record straight. Diski was too honest and spirited a writer to make that impulse ever seem like an act of spite. As this memoir compulsively retreats from the grimmest day-to-day reality of her illness (\u201cit\u2019s like a punishment. But for&nbsp;what?\u201d), she finds plenty of occasion for understanding Lessing, and even to see in herself the time-protecting writer\u2019s coldness \u2013 \u201cI was at&nbsp;least as selfish as Doris\u201d \u2013 though you&nbsp;are not quite convinced. Lessing never apparently read a word of Diski\u2019s&nbsp;books \u2013 her 10 wonderful shape-shifting novels, or her seven dazzling works of nonfiction. The loss was hers. The cliche goes that at the moment of death all our life passes in front of us. Rarely can a book so effectively have dramatised that idea. Diski wondered towards the end whether art&nbsp;was always a product of pain; she was defiantly unconvinced. Though she shared much of Lessing\u2019s blunt distrust &nbsp;of sentiment, throughout this book she can\u2019t help finding at least as much comfort in her own roles of mother and of grandmother and of wife (to \u201cThe Poet\u201d Ian Patterson) as much as \u201cwriter\u201d. Despite her unvarnished fear of \u201cdissolution, of casting my particles to the wind\u201d, and at the \u201cinsoluble grief\u201d of not seeing her grandchildren grow up, there is, still, a triumphant note to her fast unspooling history. As the scenes of her traumatic and chaotic childhood pass by she reminds us, sentence by sentence, not only that she emerged to become every bit the writer she always dreamed of being, but also that, despite everything, along the way she learned a great deal about love.

      "body": "<p>I had just finished this remarkable book and this review, when I heard of Jenny Diski\u2019s death on Thursday morning. Diski was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer in August 2014. The news prompted her to respond in the only way that had ever seemed meaningful to her, to write about it \u2013 and, once and for all, to tell the full, strange story of her writer\u2019s life, one that was linked fatefully to her having been taken in as a 15-year-old \u201cwaif\u201d by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/dorislessing\" title=\"\">Doris Lessing</a>.</p> <p>I had the privilege of talking to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/07/jenny-diski-doris-lessing-cuckoo-in-nest\" title=\"\">Diski</a> about some of this not long after she started out on her journey into that past. She confessed, among other things, the born writer\u2019s guiltiest secret: that even the worst possible news lights a spark. In hearing her diagnosis, among her first thoughts had been that cancer might be \u201ca way of writing about Doris\u201d, an idea she had been stumped by since Lessing herself had died a year earlier. \u201cI was terribly excited to think I had a subject, or a project,\u201d she said, wrapped in a cashmere blanket in her front room in Cambridge, with due irony. She will, no doubt, have had a writer\u2019s sense of pride to have met her last deadline and seen her project\u00a0published.</p> <p>The writing of <em>In Gratitude</em> has punctuated the long narrative of Diski\u2019s progressing illness, which was slowed but not defeated by sessions of chemotherapy and radiotherapy at Addenbroke\u2019s hospital. No detail of that gradual, brutal decline is overlooked in this story \u2013 Diski has a bone-dry matter-of-fact line in documenting the betrayals of her body, the humiliating falls, and \u201cmesh of steroid effects\u201d, her \u201cclot-headed\u201d hospice dreams.

      "bodyText": "Flowers (C4) | 4oD The Secret (ITV) | ITV Hub Line of Duty (BBC2) | iPlayer Game of Thrones (Sky Atlantic) \u201cSecrets are like toothbrushes. You only share them with someone you really trust.\u201d For all that this sounds coy enough to be stencilled on driftwood and sold to the type of people Olde Seaside Shoppes always see coming, nonetheless it harbours a modicum of truth \u2013 and, crucially, is the type of thing people actually say to each other, as opposed to the type of thing scriptwriters think they say. It emerged courtesy of one of the most magical programmes in a week stuffed with toothsome High Drama, a week that gives great hope for all channels (you\u2019ll take it as read that every time I say this kind of thing I\u2019m excluding ITV2). Flowers, which ran through the week on Channel 4, was a true hen\u2019s teeth rarity: we were witnessing, I think, the invention of a new genre. I\u2019m just not sure quite what it was. Thorny, yes, prickly and awkward. Bleakly black too. Resoundingly human and truly funny. Above all, the singular vision of show runner (and writer and director and co-star) Will Sharpe, an Anglo-Japanese former Footlights president. What I do know is that I could have watched it all year long. There were elements of Roald Dahl and Japanese anime, of Black Mirror and of Alan Ayckbourn, of fairytales for children who drink. Essentially the tale of a depressed writer and his savagely dysfunctional family, as the week wore on it became more forgiving. It\u2019s a sign of good drama when there\u2019s strength in depth of casting, and there were relishably chunky cameos for Angus Wright and Anna Chancellor as the true grotesques of the piece. But the family itself, the Flowers, survived near fatalities and worse to emerge, if not triumphant, then hugely and recognisably normal. Olivia Colman, now forgiven the occasional misstep in The Night Manager, was back to all her charm and glory. We have grown used to seeing Colman in full-teeth mode, but she\u2019d obviously been hiding a seventh set: no one else can hiss the accusatory \u201cblabbermouth\u201d while still blinding the world with a smile so wide nor so full of brittle self-doubt. Then there was Daniel Rigby as the son who bores everything but the pants off women, and Sophia Di Martino as sis Amy, the tender fulcrum around which much revolves. Above all, Julian Barratt as father Maurice, who conjures worlds of depression from just a pocketful of mumbles. The sadly salient point came on Thursday, when Deborah (Colman) attempted to reach the heart of Maurice\u2019s depression: we can fight it, she says, fight the monster together, maybe just with love. A shaggy shake of a sorrowful head. \u201cNo. Love just makes it worse.\u201d Truthfully, a week-long gem. We\u2019ve seen Jimmy Nesbitt in all kinds of shady roles, but none so sinister as last week. Clean-shaven, and with possibly the world\u2019s most ropey haircut, he\u2019s taken on few braver roles than that of Colin Howell in The Secret, and not just because he\u2019s had to show face with that haircut. Hypocritic, evangelising Bible basher, adulterer dentist and \u2013 possibly the worst of all \u2013 double killer: all a gal\u2019s favourites rolled up in one. This terrific dramatisation of a true story is perfectly paced to show how Howell\u2019s undeniable charm let him convince himself that God felt it would be truly for the best if he, Howell, was happy, even when that meant murdering his pregnant wife. There was a dreadful menace in seeing Nesbitt switch so readily from pink-faced beaming Baptist \u2013 genuinely transported, raptured, in swaying song \u2013 to keen amateur killer. Genevieve O\u2019Reilly is sexy if unspectacular as the love interest. Spectacular if unsexy is Jason Watkins as the community pastor. Fortunately, there\u2019s not too much humping: I think we\u2019ve seen a good bit down the years of Mr Nesbitt\u2019s bottom in action, although, come to think of it, his arse may have got its own dodgy haircut, a thought on which we will not linger. I have watched&nbsp;ahead, and it only gets better: what\u2019s truly chilling is not just how he got away with it for so long (he confessed, bizarrely, 19 years later, to church elders) but the reminder of there being nothing quite so terrifying as a man convinced of his own righteousness. It was set in Coleraine, Nesbitt\u2019s own home county. One had to go a good twitch south-west, to Enniskillen, to find the home town of the best voice of the week, because absolutely no one can imbue the slow vowels of the word \u201cfella\u201d with such gentle but minacious intent as Adrian Dunbar. First up for those vowels in a blinding finale to Line of Duty was poor Steve Arnott. True, we had all been somewhat rear-ended at the close of episode five, and thus knew Steve was innocent, but it\u2019s a tribute to everyone involved that we still wriggled and sweated for him under Ted Hastings\u2019s implacable scrutiny. Next up, of course, came \u201cDot\u201d Cottan. And here was me thinking no one with Craig Parkinson\u2019s face could ever conceivably be the real villain. Parkinson played a tremendous final shift, that face managing somehow to turn even its rare tendernesses into sneers. He has pretty much been perfection throughout: as in fact had his character, Dot, only brought down in the end by a madly off-kilter burst of sentimentality. The text he sends when the jig is up \u2013 \u201curgent exit required\u201d \u2013 and the subsequent mayhem still brings shivers. All the strands from previous series have now been knitted together with unimprovable logic: but I urgently hope that doesn\u2019t stop Jed Mercurio embarking on a next, preferably tonight. It says a little that I almost forget to mention the biggest show in the world today. Bigger and more forensic brains than mine have attempted to resist the siren lure of Game of Thrones \u2013 I\u2019m thinking chiefly of Clive James, in a magisterially readable piece for the New Yorker a couple of weeks ago, telling us exactly why we shouldn\u2019t watch it before demonstrating precisely why we should. I\u2019ll be back to it properly once it gets up a full head of steam: for the moment it\u2019s just enough to say that all is going swimmingly, which is to say bloodily and mendaciously, in Westeros: Jon Snow\u2019s still dead of course, for the moment, but more importantly, the show has survived, for the moment, parting company with the book run of George RR Martin. But it\u2019s so big and beautiful now, so smart and well-written, that not even Brienne of Tarth could make a dent in its momentum. Chief ulp last week was Melisandre\u2019s morphing into an old hag. It\u2019s been said often that the show succeeds in large part because it subverts all cliches and tropes: yet this is surely one of the most persistent folk tales of all, the beauty who has been falsely modifying herself. An ancient cliche, and thus, as such, possibly the finest subversion the show\u2019s yet pulled.",

Above all, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/24/julian-barratt-trouble-keeping-lid-on-self-hatred-mighty-boosh-flowers\" title=\"\">Julian Barratt</a> as father Maurice, who conjures worlds of depression from just a pocketful of mumbles. The sadly salient point came on Thursday, when Deborah (Colman) attempted to reach the heart of Maurice\u2019s depression: we can fight it, she says, fight the monster together, maybe just with love. A shaggy shake of a sorrowful head. \u201cNo. Love just makes it worse.\u201d Truthfully, a week-long gem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55812c3da6c49d7d847436c252e0fc5b860f1f3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55812c3da6c49d7d847436c252e0fc5b860f1f3a/0_172_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Sinister\u2019: James Nesbitt as Colin Howell in The Secret\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sinister\u2019: James Nesbitt as Colin Howell in The Secret.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steffan Hill/Hat Trick / ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019ve seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/james-nesbitt\" title=\"\">Jimmy Nesbitt</a> in all kinds of shady roles, but none so sinister as last week. Clean-shaven, and with possibly the world\u2019s most ropey haircut, he\u2019s taken on few braver roles than that of Colin Howell in <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/hub/the-secret/2a4185a0001\" title=\"\"><strong>The Secret</strong></a>, and not just because he\u2019s had to show face with that haircut. Hypocritic, evangelising Bible basher, adulterer dentist and \u2013 possibly the worst of all \u2013 double killer: all a gal\u2019s favourites rolled up in one.</p> <p>This terrific dramatisation of a true story is perfectly paced to show how Howell\u2019s undeniable charm let him convince himself that God felt it would be truly for the best if he, Howell, was happy, even when that meant murdering his pregnant wife. There was a dreadful menace in seeing Nesbitt switch so readily from pink-faced beaming Baptist \u2013 genuinely transported, raptured, in swaying song \u2013 to keen amateur killer.</p> <p>Genevieve O\u2019Reilly is sexy if unspectacular as the love interest. Spectacular if unsexy is Jason Watkins as the community pastor. Fortunately, there\u2019s not too much humping: I think we\u2019ve seen a good bit down the years of Mr Nesbitt\u2019s bottom in action, although, come to think of it, his arse may have got its own dodgy haircut, a thought on which we will not linger. I have watched\u00a0ahead, and it only gets better: what\u2019s truly chilling is not just how he got away with it for so long (he confessed, bizarrely, 19 years later, to church elders) but the reminder of there being nothing quite so terrifying as a man convinced of his own righteousness.</p> <p>It was set in Coleraine, Nesbitt\u2019s own home county. One had to go a good twitch south-west, to Enniskillen, to find the home town of the best voice of the week, because absolutely no one can imbue the slow vowels of the word \u201cfella\u201d with such gentle but minacious intent as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jul/20/adrian-dunbar-samuel-beckett-boys-of-lough-erne-enniskillen-happy-days-festival\" title=\"\">Adrian Dunbar</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ed4565d7ad921bcb10c62fdc6be0ca925a91b0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ed4565d7ad921bcb10c62fdc6be0ca925a91b0b/0_25_4242_2545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Compston and Adrian Dunbar in the \u2018blinding\u2019 Line of Duty\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Compston and Adrian Dunbar in the \u2018blinding\u2019 Line of Duty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Bourdillon/BBC/World Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First up for those vowels in a blinding finale to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b078ctww/line-of-duty-series-3-episode-5\" title=\"\"><strong>Line of Duty</strong></a> was poor Steve Arnott. True, we had all been somewhat rear-ended at the close of episode five, and thus knew Steve was innocent, but it\u2019s a tribute to everyone involved that we still wriggled and sweated for him under Ted Hastings\u2019s implacable scrutiny. Next up, of course, came \u201cDot\u201d Cottan.</p> <p>And here was me thinking no one with Craig Parkinson\u2019s face could ever conceivably be the real villain. Parkinson played a tremendous final shift, that face managing somehow to turn even its rare tendernesses into sneers. He has pretty much been perfection throughout: as in fact had his character, Dot, only brought down in the end by a madly off-kilter burst of sentimentality. The text he sends when the jig is up \u2013 \u201curgent exit required\u201d \u2013 and the subsequent mayhem still brings shivers. All the strands from previous series have now been knitted together with unimprovable logic: but I urgently hope that doesn\u2019t stop Jed Mercurio embarking on a next, preferably tonight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46817bcb051c75f0e551739217ab734d4cf30ccd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46817bcb051c75f0e551739217ab734d4cf30ccd/62_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Game of Thrones: \u2018big and beautiful, smart and well-written\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Game of Thrones: \u2018big and beautiful, smart and well-written\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky TV/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It says a little that I almost forget to mention the biggest show in the world today.

But it\u2019s so big and beautiful now, so smart and well-written, that not even Brienne of Tarth could make a dent in its momentum.</p> <p>Chief <em>ulp</em> last week was Melisandre\u2019s morphing into an old hag. It\u2019s been said often that the show succeeds in large part because it subverts all cliches and tropes: yet this is surely one of the most persistent folk tales of all, the beauty who has been falsely modifying herself. An ancient cliche, and thus, as such, possibly the finest subversion the show\u2019s yet pulled.</p>",

Following a brief but glorious run in cinemas, this 4K restoration of Akira Kurosawa\u2019s 31-year-old Sengoku Shakespeare riff transfers every ravishing nuance of its digital makeover to the small screen \u2013 its vast, swarming compositions razor-sharpened, its deep, marbled skies heavy with weather, the regal reds of its military rags glistening as if wet on the canvas. It\u2019s a rare case of restoration as revelation: having first encountered Kurosawa\u2019s poetically brutal redesign of King Lear on comparatively mucky VHS as a teen, I could see what was beautiful about it without fully seeing its beauty. Now, with its visual and sonic textures intensified as intended, the clean, soaring vigour of its storytelling is likewise heightened: the battle scenes in this neatly culture-crossed saga of feudal war and paternal betrayal tremble with personal stakes to match the formal magnitude of their staging. Ran is both great Shakespeare and great Kurosawa; if its relative newness means it\u2019s been a shade less canonised than Seven Samurai, this immaculate polish should change that. Though it\u2019s also been digitally hoovered to pristine effect, a 75th-anniversary reissue of Citizen Kane (Warner, U) isn\u2019t going to have quite the same startling effect, if only because Orson Welles\u2019s thundering 1941 anatomy of a media baron could hardly be more elevated than it is \u2013 that unedifying but imposing \u201cgreatest film of all time\u201d label sticks fast, even if it lost the pole position it held for decades to Vertigo in Sight &amp; Sound\u2019s august critics\u2019 poll. That reputation is a pretty unhelpful prism through which to view the film, attaching expectations of concrete, capital-I Importance even to Welles\u2019s most puckish instincts as a film-maker: once I had watched it as a film rather than a totem, the zest and verve and acrid humour of this precociously nonconformist \u201cbiopic\u201d of a disguised William Randolph Hearst came far more silkily to the fore. The chunkily austere packaging of this special edition \u2014 complete with hardback brochure and commentary-rich extras \u2013 doesn\u2019t exactly play this side up, but it\u2019s a handsome piece. Moving on to newer (if not fresher) fare, Citizen Kane and Daddy\u2019s Home (Universal, 12) may both be deemed films in the sense that dandelions and California redwoods are both plants. Which is not to dismiss Sean Anders\u2019s cheerfully slender family comedy (which quietly racked up \u00a3165m worldwide at Christmas, when no one, save the ticket-buyers themselves, was really looking) out of hand. There\u2019s some jolly comic sparring in this otherwise stencil-cut tale of rival fathers competing for their kids\u2019 affections: Will Ferrell\u2019s prissy, uptight stepdad may lose all the cool points to Mark Wahlberg\u2019s swaggering, ex-military biological one, but Ferrell in harassed mode is still one of the most reliable laugh-getters in mainstream American comedy. If the film lacks a shred of visual ingenuity or even narrative subtext, the stars\u2019 dork-and-cheese chemistry gets it by. It\u2019s certainly more fun than In the Heart of the Sea (Warner, 12), Ron Howard\u2019s suitably shipwrecked, would-be epic account of the maritime disaster that inspired Herman Melville\u2019s Moby-Dick. Wispily embodied by Ben Whishaw, Melville himself steers the film\u2019s stodgy framing device, extracting from grizzled ex-seadog Brendan Gleeson the glum story of how a colossal sperm whale put paid to the Essex whaleship in 1820. The lost-at-sea survival tale that ensues, headed up by strapping first mate Chris Hemsworth, is a smidge more gripping than Melville\u2019s research notes, but Howard injects no propulsive sense of derring-do into proceedings \u2013 even the effects-saturated sequences of catastrophic attack make for some pretty murky spectacle, the camera lens slicked in algae throughout. In terms of internal logic, the murk is similarly thick in Takashi Miike\u2019s demented genre-mash extravaganza Yakuza Apocalypse (Manga, 18), which plays as if scripted during one of those group-writing games where everyone blindly adds a sentence to an ongoing story. Miike, however, makes a virtue of senselessness: there\u2019s barrelling, bananas momentum to this nuclear meltdown of a martial arts B-movie, in which monsters, vampires and a mute marauder in a moth-eaten felt frog costume tear up the expected genre terrain. Miike, already a prolific director by reputation, appears to have made about a dozen films at once here: arduous nightmare fuel for many, but for those on the director\u2019s barely decipherable wavelength, it\u2019s an almighty party. Intrepid cinemagoers are currently bathing in the heady delights of Portuguese auteur Miguel Gomes\u2019s astonishing Arabian Nights trilogy, but those waiting for the film to hit Mubi.com\u2019s streaming menu in the next month can do some prep work. Never previously released in the UK, Gomes\u2019s 2004 debut The Face You Deserve is also getting a Mubi airing, and it\u2019s well worth a dive. Labelling it more conventional than Gomes\u2019s subsequent output is strictly a relative call: there\u2019s enough wistful whimsy to this musical comedy of a 30-year-old manchild surrendering to his alter egos to drive some around the bend. Just as many, however, will be enchanted by Gomes\u2019s fey muddling of fairy-tale convention with postmodern romanticism. Consider it a sweetly inessential introduction to an essential voice.",

As storm Katie tightened her grip on the Cornish coast, the 112-year-old sailing ship was ploughing through high winds, and minutes after casting off we were pulling up sails, tacking and steering. Owner and skipper Nikki Alford commanded respect while instilling a sense of fun, and within half an hour had turned us eight strangers into a crew capable of steering a two-masted wooden ship through a storm. In a couple of hours I\u2019d hauled ropes with Anton, who\u2019s in his late 70s, and hoisted sails with a father and son from Exeter. We learned how to tack and could soon just about name all the sails. I had joined the tall ship at Fowey for a two-night taster weekend. Apart from taking the Seacat from Liverpool to Dublin when I was eight, I had never sailed before. We were a mixed bunch, ranging from competent sailors to, well, me. Either way, everyone had a role. \u201cI like to get everyone involved,\u201d said Nikki. \u201cI want people to feel they\u2019re part of a crew \u2013 and learn a thing or two.\u201d Once the storm passed, Bessie Ellen picked up speed. The clouds lifted and we were surrounded by ocean and azure sky. In the choppy waves beneath the bow a school of dolphins appeared, jumping in perfect unison. London-based twentysomething Kate (another non-sailor) was soon climbing the rigging for a better view. Wildlife spotting is part of the fun: seal colonies, basking sharks, puffins. Built in Plymouth in 1904 and expected to last no more than 20 years, Bessie Ellen is the last wooden trading ketch still under sail in Britain. At 35 metres long, and carrying up to 150 tonnes, she spent her early life taking bulk cargoes such as clay, peat and salt around the UK and Ireland. In 2000 Nikki rescued her from a dockyard in Denmark and took her to Plymouth for renovation. \u201cMe and a group of friends spent some very happy years working on Bessie Ellen,\u201d said Nikki, who fell in love with the boat at the age of 18 after seeing a photograph of her. \u201cIt was one of the best times of my life.\u201d The ship sails in a range of locations: summer voyages to the Outer Hebrides are particularly impressive, and there are plans to offer trips to the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, always with an ever-changing global crew. After a few hours on the water we docked in the 18th-century harbour of Charlestown, near St Austell. Originally built to export copper and import coal, it\u2019s a popular setting for films and TV series such as Hornblower and Poldark. We drank tea and ginger beer \u2013 against seasickness \u2013 before heading to nearby Silver Mines for the night. Dinner was served in the 12-bed sleeping area we shared, which became a temporary dining room. (Lunches were eaten in the sunshine on deck.) Chef Pete, who came as a guest and loved it so much he joined the team, creates beautiful meals in the tiny, rocking galley. \u201cI try and incorporate a local flavour into all my meals,\u201d said Pete. \u201cMussels in Scotland, fish from the markets in Cornwall.\u201d We feasted on risotto made with nettles we\u2019d picked on the shore in Fowey, fresh mackerel pate and rhubarb and vanilla mousse, and bonded over beer and wine from the honesty bar, and whisky brought by one of the guests. The hold now has 12 built-in bunk beds \u2013 simple but comfortable. The exhaustion of a day\u2019s sailing combined with the lulling of the waves and the murmur of a mystery snorer gave me some of the best nights\u2019 sleep I\u2019d had in months. There was time on the last morning for more exploration of Fowey, inspiration for many writers and artists. A footpath led to Pont Pill, where novelist Daphne Du Maurier found the wrecked schooner Jane Slade. Its carved figurehead inspired her first novel, The Loving Spirit. Over a Cornish ale in Fowey, Nikki told tales of her earlier life as a ship hand \u2013 seeing pirates in the Malacca Strait and being arrested in Vietnam after police mistook them for spies \u2013 tales you don\u2019t hear in luxury yachting circles. \u201cI simply love being on the sea,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a unique, amazing way to explore the world.\u201d It\u2019s true. Sailing past coves and into historic ports gives a sense of Cornwall\u2019s nautical heritage in a way land trips can\u2019t, and there is a definite romance to sailing a ship as old and experienced as Bessie Ellen. \u201cBritain has neglected its sailing past,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s an idea now that sailing belongs to a certain kind of world. But it\u2019s fun. It\u2019s tough, gritty, an adventure \u2026 that\u2019s what people love.\u201d \u2022 The trip was provided by Bessie Ellen Charters (07800 825382, bessie-ellen.com). Three-day taster weekends in Cornwall cost from \u00a3290pp, including all onboard meals. Longer trips out of other UK ports are also available",

    "webTitle": "Six of the best Wi-Fi speakers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bowers &amp; Wilkins Zeppelin \u00a3499; five amp drivers, 250W total output; AirPlay, Spotify, Bluetooth Quick start: Download the app, a few swipes and touches and you\u2019re in. Around a minute (initial set-up). Design: Pleasant lozenge shape should look good on your sideboard and the other boxier speakers in the range will make chunky bookends. Only needs one cable, the unit has a few subtly placed buttons but we never needed to use them. Best app of the units tested, mainly because (aside from a few seconds when setting up) you don\u2019t have to use it. Sound: Natural sounding vocals, but songs can feel underpowered. Does a faithful job without really bringing your collection to life. Songs normally guaranteed to rouse a few goosebumps, such as James Taylor\u2019s Fire and Rain, can sound a little restrained. However, Justin Timberlake sounds really good on these speakers. Verdict: Superior software and design make this a serious competitor to the Sonos as the hub of a multi-room system. Try listening to both before you buy. Raumfeld Stereo Cubes \u00a3369; four drivers 160W; Tidal, Spotify, Napster Quick start: Download app, press a button on the unit, input your Wi-Fi password, fumble around the app and join up your streaming service of choice (although Apple Music isn\u2019t supported). Nearly five minutes. Design: Requires one power line and a cable to connect the speakers to each other. The app is like most hardware manufactures\u2019 efforts \u2013 a bit clunky \u2013 and it\u2019s best to sidestep it and stick to the familiar one belonging to your streaming service. The retro-styled cubes are part of a range of multi-room speakers, should you want to expand around your home. Sound: Reveals lots of detail, loves a piano, but bass can sound polite rather than dirty. For example, it reproduces the percussion and vocals of James Blake\u2019s Limit to Your Love beautifully but the bass doesn\u2019t vibrate and wobble like it ought to. However, concerts sound particularly evocative: Bowie\u2019s David Live album is tremendously atmospheric. Verdict: Great styling and a direct sales model keep prices down, but they perform best with music made in the 20th century. Denon CEOL + Dali Zensor 1 speakers \u00a3299/\u00a3199; 130W; AirPlay, Spotify Quick start: Took two attempts. No app download required. Around 10 minutes. Design: This is an amp with streaming capabilities. So the speakers are wired, but it also features ye olde CD player. You could even rig it up to some old hi-fi speakers. Full legacy listening pleasure can be achieved via the aerial supplied for listening to AM/FM radio, or adding a newly fashionable turntable. You could even wire in your TV using the optical inputs, although that\u2019s quite a tangle of cables, which may be missing the point somewhat. Sound: Tons of detail, bringing out the background chatter in D\u2019 Angelo\u2019s Brown Sugar and revealing previously unheard finger-clicks in James Blake. Missy Elliot\u2019s Get Ur Freak On never felt more dynamic and Van Morrison\u2019s Veedon Fleece sounded tremendous. Verdict: With its CD player and multiple inputs for hi-fi separates, this is a great option for the music lover who wants to inch slowly into the world of digital music. Bose SoundTouch30 \u00a3429; Spotify, Deezer Quick start: The Bose app demands your email address and a password, entails lots of updating and \u201cplease wait\u201d messages. Took two attempts. Around 20 minutes. Design: This white unit wouldn\u2019t look out of place in the waiting room of a private health facility \u2013 you might prefer the black version. It\u2019s tricky to operate it without using Bose\u2019s SoundTouch app, which is an unnecessarily layer of mediocre user experience. Doesn\u2019t support AirPlay or Apple Music, so until that changes there are better choices for Apple owners. Sound: Pre-Wi-Fi, Bose established a name for delivering great sound from something so small, but now the market is crowded with competition, Bose\u2019s ear for sound needs a retune. Music sounds less complex, with bass turned up as a substitute for detail. If it were a glass of wine, this would be an over\u2011oaked chardonnay. Verdict: Not the best software or looks, but if you\u2019re a basshead you might want to overlook that. Sonos Play:5 \u00a3429; Apple Music, Spotify, Deezer, Tidal Quick start: Very straightforward. Three minutes. Design: You can\u2019t operate your Sonos without using its app, but the app is, once you submit to it, as well designed as those from Apple and Spotify. It\u2019s stable, drop-outs are very rare and switching between and tagging together speakers from around your home is a doddle. The fact that you can buy additional units relatively cheaply to save you cranking up the volume when you move into another room is another major plus. Sound: Optimised for the likes of Drake. Rich, bassy polished sound sometimes buffs out the detail and intimacy that some of the other units here draw out from recordings. It sounds powerful at lower volumes whereas some of the others need more volume to show off their abilities. Verdict: Superior ease of use, gigantic range of streaming services and a choice of other units make Sonos the market leader, although audiophiles might find the sound not quite up to standard. Cambridge Minx Xi + Minx XL speakers \u00a3399; \u00a3199; 80W; Spotify, 10 audio formats Quick start: Three minutes, without using the instructions. Design: Control of the system requires use of a remote control and Cambridge\u2019s dated-looking Stream Magic app plus the Spotify app (if that\u2019s the service you\u2019re using). This isn\u2019t as convenient as the other units, which can be controlled purely with a smartphone. There\u2019s no AirPlay connectivity and Apple Music isn\u2019t supported, so it\u2019s not ideal for Mac devotees. This set-up is really intended for users who want to hook it up to a networked storage device (NAS) containing high-resolution files of their music collection. Sound: Crisp and dynamic across all genres. The boot stomping and clapping of Queen\u2019s We Will Rock You sounds energetic rather than clompy. Selena Gomez\u2019s Hands to Myself pops out of the speakers like it should. Verdict: Over-featured if you\u2019re just looking to stream music from your phone, but if you\u2019re looking to rig up a NAS and even a turntable this would be outstanding.

Around a minute (initial set-up).</p> <p><strong>Design:</strong> Pleasant lozenge shape should look good on your sideboard and the other boxier speakers in the range will make chunky bookends. Only needs one cable, the unit has a few subtly placed buttons but we never needed to use them. Best app of the units tested, mainly because (aside from a few seconds when setting up) you don\u2019t have to use it.</p> <p><strong>Sound:</strong> Natural sounding vocals, but songs can feel underpowered. Does a faithful job without really bringing your collection to life. Songs normally guaranteed to rouse a few goosebumps, such as James Taylor\u2019s Fire and Rain, can sound a little restrained. However, Justin Timberlake sounds really good on these speakers.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Superior software and design make this a serious competitor to the Sonos as the hub of a multi-room system.

The app is like most hardware manufactures\u2019 efforts \u2013 a bit clunky \u2013 and it\u2019s best to sidestep it and stick to the familiar one belonging to your streaming service. The retro-styled cubes are part of a range of multi-room speakers, should you want to expand around your home.</p> <p><strong>Sound:</strong> Reveals lots of detail, loves a piano, but bass can sound polite rather than dirty. For example, it reproduces the percussion and vocals of James Blake\u2019s Limit to Your Love beautifully but the bass doesn\u2019t vibrate and wobble like it ought to. However, concerts sound particularly evocative: Bowie\u2019s <em>David Live</em> album is tremendously atmospheric.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Great styling and a direct sales model keep prices down, but they perform best with music made in the 20th century.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2a77291d5297b61d7f4355b0fb4f2d76ac003d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2a77291d5297b61d7f4355b0fb4f2d76ac003d1/0_164_4919_2951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Versatile: the Denon Ceol with Dali Zensor speakers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Versatile: the Denon Ceol with Dali Zensor speakers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://www.denon.co.uk/uk/product/compactsystem/networkmusicsystem/ceoln9\">Denon CEOL</a> + <a href=\"http://www.dali-speakers.com/uk/loudspeakers/zensor/zensor-1/\">Dali Zensor 1 speakers</a></h2> <p><strong>\u00a3299/\u00a3199; 130W; AirPlay, Spotify</strong></p> <p><strong>Quick start:</strong> Took two attempts. No app download required. Around 10 minutes.</p> <p><strong>Design:</strong> This is an amp with streaming capabilities. So the speakers are wired, but it also features ye olde CD player. You could even rig it up to some old hi-fi speakers. Full legacy listening pleasure can be achieved via the aerial supplied for listening to AM/FM radio, or adding a newly fashionable turntable. You could even wire in your TV using the optical inputs, although that\u2019s quite a tangle of cables, which may be missing the point somewhat.</p> <p><strong>Sound:</strong> Tons of detail, bringing out the background chatter in D\u2019 Angelo\u2019s <em>Brown Sugar</em> and revealing previously unheard finger-clicks in James Blake. Missy Elliot\u2019s Get Ur Freak On never felt more dynamic and Van Morrison\u2019s <em>Veedon Fleece</em> sounded tremendous.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> With its CD player and multiple inputs for hi-fi separates, this is a great option for the music lover who wants to inch slowly into the world of digital music.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72deabf7c69c5348aa65f77b5287dc5d5cbc9f1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72deabf7c69c5348aa65f77b5287dc5d5cbc9f1a/148_268_3819_2291/1000.jpg\" alt=\"For bassheads: the Bose Soundtouch30\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For bassheads: the Bose Soundtouch30</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.bose.co.uk/GB/en/home-and-personal-audio/speakers/wireless-speakers/soundtouch-30-series-III-wireless-music-system/\">Bose SoundTouch30</a></h2> <p><strong>\u00a3429; Spotify, Deezer</strong></p> <p><strong>Quick start:</strong> The Bose app demands your email address and a password, entails lots of updating and \u201cplease wait\u201d messages.

Around 20 minutes.</p> <p><strong>Design:</strong> This white unit wouldn\u2019t look out of place in the waiting room of a private health facility \u2013 you might prefer the black version. It\u2019s tricky to operate it without using Bose\u2019s SoundTouch app, which is an unnecessarily layer of mediocre user experience. Doesn\u2019t support AirPlay or Apple Music, so until that changes there are better choices for Apple owners.</p> <p><strong>Sound:</strong> Pre-Wi-Fi, Bose established a name for delivering great sound from something so small, but now the market is crowded with competition, Bose\u2019s ear for sound needs a retune. Music sounds less complex, with bass turned up as a substitute for detail. If it were a glass of wine, this would be an over\u2011oaked chardonnay.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Not the best software or looks, but if you\u2019re a basshead you might want to overlook that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3484c9314abaf14882d45440e8a9ffcf2cf2804\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3484c9314abaf14882d45440e8a9ffcf2cf2804/0_328_4621_2772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Easy to use: the Sonos Play: 5.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Easy to use: the Sonos Play: 5.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><br /></h2> <h2><a href=\"http://www.sonos.com/en-gb/shop/play5\">Sonos Play:5</a></h2> <p><strong>\u00a3429; Apple Music, Spotify, Deezer, Tidal</strong></p> <p><strong>Quick start:</strong> Very straightforward.

      "bodyText": "Hillsborough: The Truth (BBC 5 Live) | iPlayer The Eddie Mair Interview (Radio 4) | iPlayer Start Up | Gimlet Media \u201cArguably the greatest miscarriage of justice of our time.\u201d This was how Kelly Cates introduced 5 Live\u2019s two-hour special Hillsborough: The Truth, and quite right too. Cates\u2019s dad, Kenny Dalglish, was manager of Liverpool in 1989 and she was at the match, aged 13. She guided this programme with dignity and tact. God, it was hard to hear. I can\u2019t imagine what it was \u2013 and is \u2013 like to live it. In the opening part, supporters told their stories of what happened in the Leppings Lane end. Neil Fitzmaurice\u2019s account was visceral. The crowd, he said, was solid but it was liquid at the same time. \u201cYou would go from not being able to move to suddenly getting thrown 10 or 15 feet to the left.\u201d The glass in his watch popped. And: \u201cPeople were biting me, to let me know they were still alive\u2026\u201d David Conn, the Guardian reporter, made the point that the traumatic experience of the supporters was immediately overtaken by the need to fight against the police and media lies. Thus, the trauma was suppressed, left untold. Supporters were vomiting and defecating, emptying their bladders, pouring with sweat. The police said that the pens smelt of alcohol. \u201cTo have that smell, the smell of death, caricatured as the smell of alcohol was\u2026 infantilising.\u201d Conn stumbled a little while speaking. When reliving such situations, words can fail you, as they did Fitzmaurice, who fell suddenly silent when trying to describe the scene. His story was gently taken up by another supporter, Dan Davies. Supporter is the right term. The establishment derides Liverpudlians for their humour, their fight, their belief in solidarity, their ability to paint the truth with words, but it has been those characteristics that have pulled the survivors of Hillsborough through 27 years to vindication. This programme gave these people and others \u2013 players, MPs, relatives of the dead \u2013 the space to recount that long, long journey from the match to last week. To hear them tell their tale is right and proper and 5 Live was the right station to let them tell it. This is required listening. Over on Radio 4, PM\u2019s Eddie Mair has been letting people tell their tales for many years. Lately, the BBC seems to have awoken to his talents, shoving him on Newsnight, letting him make programmes with nutty Robert Peston. Anyway, for all us Mair fans, there\u2019s now another spin-off podcast from PM, The Eddie Mair Interview. Subscribe and you get one a week. If you want some light relief after the Hillsborough show, though, this is not the place to find it. I listened to two: the most recent featured a man wrongly imprisoned for 23 years, the second a woman who was abducted by an internet groomer aged 13. Both stories had a kind of redemption, but I found myself pacing around the kitchen, clattering pans, trying to displace my fear. Mair was great, though, and I\u2019m sure there will be jollier interviews in the future. A quick word about the StartUp podcast. Now into series three, I\u2019m wavering a little. The programmes are still meticulously made, the interviews and presentation exemplary\u2026 but, God, aren\u2019t entrepreneurs dull after a while? Especially in this internet era. Everyone just stays indoors and fiddles with their website. Can\u2019t StartUp feature a business that involves the business head actually leaving the house and doing something?",

Mair was great, though, and I\u2019m sure there will be jollier interviews in the future.</p> <p>A quick word about the <a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/\" title=\"\"><strong>StartUp</strong></a> podcast. Now into series three, I\u2019m wavering a little. The programmes are still meticulously made, the interviews and presentation exemplary\u2026 but, God, aren\u2019t entrepreneurs dull after a while? Especially in this internet era. Everyone just stays indoors and fiddles with their website. Can\u2019t <em>StartUp</em> feature a business that involves the business head actually leaving the house and doing something?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Breakfast in the morning, work during the day, relaxation in the evening followed by bedtime. The waking hours have a certain rhythm, and the 24-hour cycle of the Earth\u2019s rotation has resulted in a human sleeping pattern that largely takes place at night for about seven or eight hours of continuous shut-eye. Several studies have found that disturbing this ancient sleep-wake cycle can make people more prone to illnesses such as diabetes, obesity, gastrointestinal disorders and heart disease. Now, a study on nearly 300 pensioners at 24 GP practices in England has found that the best time to have a flu jab is probably in the morning, as this is the time when the immune systems of older people are better able to produce virus-fighting antibodies. Scientists believe that up to 2,400 lives might be saved if all winter flu jabs were given to older patients before noon, as this is the time when their immune defences are at their best. It is further evidence that timing can be critical \u2013 even vital \u2013 for certain activities. So what else do we know about the \u201cbiological clock\u201d that appears to control our circadian rhythm? Here are a few questions that can be answered. What is the biological clock and why do our bodies follow a circadian rhythm? Scientists are now pretty sure that there are two kinds of clock at work in the body. The central \u201cmaster\u201d clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, a collection of about 20,000 oscillating nerve cells in the hypothalamus of the brain, is intricately linked with daylight from the optic nerve of the eye. This internal clock signals when it is time to be awake or asleep, and is linked with hormone levels and body temperature, which correspondingly fluctuate over a circadian period of \u201cabout a day\u201d. However, more recently scientists have discovered that other tissues in the body have their own peripheral clocks that are influenced by other environmental factors. Eating, for instance, can reset the peripheral clock of the gastrointestinal tract. Does disturbing the circadian rhythm cause health problems? There is clear evidence to suggest that it does. Shift workers who work at night, for instance, are known to be at higher risk of cardiovascular disease. One study found they were 40% more likely to suffer from this illness compared with non-shift workers. One suggestion is that altering the body\u2019s sleep-wake cycle causes an uncoupling of the central body clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the peripheral clocks in the rest of the body, caused for instance by eating at inappropriate times over the 24-hour cycle. And as the pensioners\u2019 study showed, sleep can also influence the activity levels of the immune defences. So what is the best time to eat to stay healthy? Studies on mice have clearly shown that allowing them to eat only when they are naturally awake, which is at night because they are nocturnal, results in fewer metabolic defects. They are healthier and less obese than mice allowed to eat all day and night long. Similarly, a study by Frank Scheer at Harvard Medical School on 420 dieters in Spain found that those who ate their main meal before 3pm lost more weight than those who ate later. The message appears simple: make lunch your biggest meal of the day. When is the best time to sleep in order to be alert and creative? This depends on the individual. Some people are night owls, some are morning larks. Mimi Shirasu-Hiza, a sleep researcher at Columbia University in New York, says that even sleeping in one eight-hour stint might not be right for everyone. \u201cAs a night owl, my own optimal time for writing or thinking creatively is from about 10pm to 2am. Because I have young kids who wake up early in the morning, I have switched to a bimodal or segmented sleep pattern,\u201d she says. \u201cI go to sleep with my kids at 8pm or so, wake up at 10pm-ish and work for a few hours, go back to sleep and wake up with the kids in the morning. There is some evidence this was not an unusual sleep pattern in pre-industrial society.\u201d In today\u2019s 24/7 culture, is there a best time to engage with social networks? Sleep refreshes the mind as well as the body and a study of 509m tweets sent over two years by 2.4 million Twitter users found that the most cheerful and upbeat tweets are posted between 8am and 9am. The afternoon dip in concentration means that between 3pm and 6pm people are more likely to retweet other people\u2019s tweets than create their own. The most emotional time for Twitter is between 10pm and 11pm when users were \u201calert and engaged, but also more agitated\u201d, researchers found.",

      "bodyText": "After 27 years, justice came in a few short moments. At just after 11am last Tuesday, Sir John Goldring took his seat in a specially converted courtroom in Warrington, to silence. There was no preamble from the coroner today; not even a perfunctory greeting. As the microphone sputtered to life, the most controversial inquests in British history were about to come to an end. After two years, and nearly 300 days of evidence, from almost 1,000 witnesses, everything would rest on 14 questions \u2013 and on six women and three men from Warrington. The jury had given up two years of their lives to resolve this most bitter of disputes. Now, they were restricted to uttering a few simple words in response to the coroner. \u201cYes,\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d or \u201cIt is\u201d. But with those four words, they would rewrite history. A few hundred yards from court, across the Birchwood industrial park, in building 401, I was one of 200 people \u2013 survivors, the bereaved, and other campaigners \u2013 who filed into an annexe to watch a stream of the verdict, broadcast live. As we waited, quietly, a member of the inquest secretariat arrived to inform us that the annexe was technically a part of the courtroom itself: we should therefore show no emotion as the jury\u2019s determinations were announced. We ask you to be quiet and dignified, she said. A few seats along from me, Damian Kavanagh, a friend and fellow survivor, muttered: \u201cWe\u2019ve been dignified for 27 years.\u201d Eventually, the camera wobbled into focus, and the face of Sir John Goldring appeared. Unseen, off camera, the forewoman confirmed that the jury had arrived at its determinations to all 14 questions. Within moments, the debate over Hillsborough would be settled, once and for all. Here it was, in front of us on a TV screen \u2013 justice, finally. Like an intravenous drip \u2013 delivered drop by drop. I was 19 when I went to Hillsborough, to watch my team play an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest. A man, but in many respects still a boy; crushed to the brink of death behind the steel-mesh fence of pen 3. Many of the 96 died within feet of me. I survived, but, unable to move any part of my body from the neck down in the crush, I could do no more for these people than watch them die. I owed it to them to witness their final moments, to bear testimony; but I never thought I would live to see this day. I am sitting with my girlfriend, Deb, who was my girlfriend that day, and has seen me through years of anxiety, and anger. In the seats beside and in front of me are other survivors. Damian survived the crush in pen 4, aged 20. He had obtained a ticket for the game for his friend, David Rimmer, who died in the same pen. Tim Knowles was a 17-year-old A-level student, one of 10 friends from Formby who had gone to the match; only seven came back alive. Mike Bracken found himself crushed outside the ground, before entering through an exit gate. After buying a drink to recover, he was horrified to find thousands more fans converging on the tunnel to the already packed central pens. With no police officers deployed to seal the tunnel, Mike briefly tried to steer them away. But he was a 20-year-old fan in a jumper and jeans. There were no police there, the fans reasoned: so what could be the problem? Nick Braley is an Ipswich fan. In 1989, aged 19, he was a student at Sheffield Poly, excited to be going to an FA Cup semi-final, even as a neutral. He was crushed towards the front of pen 3 and survived through the luck of being turned side-on to the fence. He was traumatised for years. The West Midlands officers who took his statement, which was critical of the policing, dismissed him as \u201ca left-wing agitator\u201d. Richie Greaves was 23 when he was caught in one of the worst-affected parts of pen 3. He gave evidence to the first inquests, and came back to tell the same truth in Warrington. His wife, Lou, sits beside Deb: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to keep breathing,\u201d Lou says, squeezing Deb\u2019s arm gently. She is desperate to get her husband back. Now, the jury begin. Their answers to the first five questions \u2013 on the multiple failures in police planning and in the police operation on the day \u2013 are resolved quickly. A formality. But all hinges on questions 6 and 7. Q6: \u201cAre you satisfied, so that you are sure, that those who died in the disaster were unlawfully killed? Answer \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019.\u201d We sit here not just as survivors, but as some of the accused. From the moment the inquests began, in March 2014, lawyers for the former match commanders at Hillsborough, led by John Beggs QC, have thrown vicious allegations on their behalf: that we were drunk, without tickets, badly behaved, aggressive and non-compliant. We sit quietly, and wonder if the jury has seen through their bile. It will not be easy: over three decades, we have been described as \u201canimalistic\u201d (Chief Constable Peter Wright), \u201ctanked-up yobs\u201d (Margaret Thatcher\u2019s press secretary Sir Bernard Ingham), and \u2013 quite simply \u2013 as \u201cmental\u201d (Paul Middup, Police Federation rep). Much of the public held us to be the people who pissed on brave coppers, or attacked them as they gave the kiss of life to stricken victims \u2013 all this while we were busy robbing the dead. These allegations, of course, were mostly carried in the Sun\u2019s infamous front-page story of 19 April 1989, under the headline The Truth. It was Kelvin MacKenzie\u2019s final choice as a banner headline; the first he had considered was: \u201cYou Scum\u201d. A cross-section of the scum are here today. Damian has spent his career as a pensions administrator. Tim is a newspaper sub-editor. Nick is an accountant. Richie runs his own courier firm. Mike is a digital executive and a CBE. I am an author and journalist. All of us, just your average football fans of the 1980s. Now the coroner reads out Q6 to the forewoman, still unseen. \u201cAre you satisfied, so that you are sure, that those who died in the disaster were unlawfully killed? Is your answer yes?\u201d The forewoman\u2019s voice is calm and reassuring, and wears lightly the huge responsibility. With the faintest trace of a lisp, she says: \u201cYes.\u201d People scream, and jump to their feet. Mike\u2019s head begins to tremble in his hands. Richie turns towards me and punches the air. I turn slowly to Deb with tears in my eyes, and she smiles and rubs my back. Then the moment is gone. For the coroner is on to Q7: \u201cWas there any behaviour on the part of football supporters which caused or contributed to the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles?\u201d This is not just a question of truth now: people\u2019s lives are in the balance. To be unfairly blamed for killing people is an insult so grievous as to seriously disturb the mind. I know of one survivor, \u201cIan\u201d, who lost a friend in pen 3. In 2007, Ian became upset about the controversy generated by the appearance of Kelvin MacKenzie on Newsnight, and a few weeks later he hanged himself. There was Stephen Whittle, who gave his match ticket to a friend, who died. In February 2011, Stephen stepped in front of an express train. Two of my mates who survived pen 3 have tried to kill themselves; both, mercifully, survived. But we know that if this next question goes against us, people will almost certainly take their own lives. The jury cannot know this, of course. I look around at Deb, at Richie, at Damian and Lou. No one looks at me. The coroner: \u201cWas there any behaviour on the part of football supporters which caused or contributed to the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles? Is your answer No?\u201d \u201cIt is.\u201d People leap to their feet and punch the air. But again, momentary relief, for we are only halfway there. Now, having answered No, the jury are asked a supplementary question: was there any behaviour on the part of supporters that may have caused or contributed to the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles? That \u201cmay\u201d sets the threshold so low, we fear the jury are practically being urged to find against us. As Tim Knowles said over an anguished pint a few months ago: \u201cWhat kind of question is \u2018May have?\u2019 I might be found responsible for killing my friends on the basis of a vague, theoretical possibility.\u201d But there is nothing vague about will happen to us: we will be vilified once more \u2013 for ever more \u2013 by the rightwing media and the police. We will be, for the first time in an official hearing, found culpable in killing our fellow fans. It is not the jury\u2019s fault: they have been bounced into this. But people will die on a Yes, they may have\u2026 The coroner: \u201cWas there any behaviour on the part of supporters that may have caused or contributed to the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles? Is your answer No?\u201d I am sitting down but my knees give way. Tears are falling either side of my nose. The woman with the reassuring voice says \u201cIt is.\u201d And the place erupts. Compression asphyxia. Ninety-three times it is recorded that afternoon as the cause of death at Hillsborough. It is definitive, but it offers only a glimpse into how our supporters died, or how extensive were the failings of the police and South Yorkshire metropolitan ambulance service. On 15 April 1989, I walked down a tunnel into Hillsborough, and into the sunshine, thinking: \u201cWhere would you rather be on a day like this?\u201d An hour later, at just after 3pm, I am caught somewhere between this life and the next. The game has kicked off. I can see people in the north stand following it with their eyes. Others are fixated on the space around me, and pointing furiously, or running down the gangways to the pitch, shouting at police officers. But they are far away. Closer, a few feet away, people are dead on their feet. The air is thick with the smell of excrement and urine. Three men are changing colour, from a pale violet to a ghostly pallor. Some have vomit streaming from their nostrils. People are weeping. Others are gibbering, trying to black out what is happening. I am 19, and I know that I am about to die. As my brain begins to flood my body with endorphins, I am lifted above the crowd, in a bubble of warm water. It is strangely peaceful. Then shouting: rasping, aggressive shouting. In a Yorkshire accent: \u201cGet back you stupid bastards!\u201d Seconds, maybe minutes later, I open my eyes again. The sky is still blue, and the police have finally come through the gate in the perimeter fence. For the first time in an hour, I am standing up, untouched. Now, as I feel my body for broken ribs or bones, a group of people in front of me \u2013 who\u2019d had their backs to me throughout the crush, and who I thought were alive \u2013 simply keel over and hit the concrete. A heap of tangled corpses piles up off the ground, three feet high. After a few seconds, I see a limb move and realise someone is alive in there. One police officer who comes through the gate later says that the scene \u201cwas like Belsen\u201d. Over the next half hour, as the police rush to get word to the BBC, the FA and Liverpool FC\u2019s own lawyer that Liverpool fans had caused the disaster by storming the gates, I and hundreds of other survivors are kicking down advertising boards and picking up bodies. A group of us sprint to a dead man who is lying partially naked by the goalline. We put him on a board and run towards the Forest end, in search of ambulances. When none materialise, we exit the stadium via a ramp and are directed by police into the gymnasium, now a temporary mortuary. Behind a badminton net, rows and rows of corpses under paper sheets, a policeman\u2019s helmet on each chest. Coppers are sat around the edge of the gym, on chairs or on the floor, sobbing, hysterical. Someone is headbutting a wall. On the floor, two or three groups of people are each tending to a casualty: some are beating their patient\u2019s chest, furiously, or blowing air into their mouth. Another man is kneeling, cradling the head of a lad in a black jacket, rocking him backwards and forwards gently, as he weeps. \u201cHe\u2019s my brother,\u201d he says, sobbing. \u201cHe\u2019s my brother.\u201d But he isn\u2019t waking up. I am holding the right hand of the dead man we picked up. It is cold, and greased in sweat. He is heavy, but I am reluctant to let him go. Someone leans over one of the casualties on the floor and begins to administer the last rites. And a voice in my head simply says: \u201cYou need to get out of here, now, otherwise you\u2019ll go mad.\u201d For the next two decades, many survivors would struggle to retain their sanity. But it wasn\u2019t us who had lost our senses: it was the British establishment. Chief superintendent David Duckenfield, the match commander, did not lie alone, of course: this deceit was not simply the work of a bunch of bent coppers, but the product of a political culture debased. For years, historians have routinely rubbished the 70s as the decade that shamed us \u2013 10 years of loon pants and luminous food; Britain at its most unhinged. But Hillsborough, a stain on British history like no other, can only be fully understood as part of the Thatcher era that gave rise to it. It was she who gave political cover to the South Yorkshire police, after they attacked the miners at Orgreave in 1984 and then tried to fit up dozens of them on a charge of riot \u2013 immunity their reward for breaking the strike. And as Kenneth Clarke MP has admitted, Thatcher had declared football fans as an enemy within: not football hooligans \u2013 football fans. On 4 August 1989, Lord Justice Taylor produced his interim report into the causes of the disaster. He concluded that the main cause was overcrowding, and the main reason was the failure of police control. Here, essentially, was the truth the jury found in Warrington last week \u2013 laid before the public in August 1989. But the public didn\u2019t get to see it first: Thatcher and her cabinet did. On 1 August 1989, the report was presented to the home secretary, Douglas Hurd, who sent an internal memo to Thatcher. The chief constable, Hurd thought, will \u201chave to resign\u201d, as the \u201cenormity of the disaster, and the extent to which the inquiry blames the police, demand this\u201d. Hurd requested Thatcher\u2019s support for his own statement, in which he would \u201cwelcome unreservedly the broad thrust of the report\u201d. Thatcher replied: \u201cWhat do we mean by \u2018welcoming the broad thrust of the report\u2019? The broad thrust is devastating criticism of the police. Is that for us to welcome? \u2026 Surely we welcome the thoroughness of the report and its recommendations. MT\u201d. And, at a stroke, justice was denied. Hurd had seen the rug pulled from under his feet. Now, he did not, could not, call for Chief Constable Peter Wright\u2019s resignation \u2013 a move that would have left South Yorkshire police no option but to accept full responsibility. Suitably emboldened, they came out fighting, for 27 years. Afew days after the disaster, I walk in to my doctor\u2019s surgery. I am struggling to breathe properly, but I know, as I sit in the waiting room, that it isn\u2019t my body that\u2019s in need of attention. After half an hour I am called in by a GP \u2013 old, patrician; pinstripe suit and spectacles. I tell him, quietly, that I was at Hillsborough on Saturday and my chest hurts. Hmm, he says. He presses a stethoscope to my skin, then sits down to write a referral for an x-ray. But he does not look at me. As I button up my shirt I am looking at his bald head. Look at me, I am saying, silently. Look at me, you bastard. But he won\u2019t. Eventually, he hands over the referral while setting his eyes off to my right, and says \u2013 mumbles \u2013 \u201cDo you\u2026 do you want to talk to anyone about this?\u201d I pause for a few moments, then say no. I get up to go, and am almost at the door when he says: \u201cIt does look as if the Liverpool fans were to blame then, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d I turn to look at him, but all I feel is embarrassment \u2013 not for myself, but for him. \u201cOh well, good luck,\u201d he says, brightly. So it is that the first professional people to talk to me after Hillsborough are the West Midlands police. The WMP were initially appointed to assist the Taylor inquiry, and were retained as advisers to the wretched coroner, Stefan Popper, at the original inquests, between late 1990 and March 1991. In July 1989, two plainclothes detectives arrived at my home in Stevenage. It was a Sunday, around 2pm, and the golf was on the TV. They sat me down, told me they would write down my statement by hand, and that I should then read it, and, if I was happy, sign it. So I began to tell them what had happened, and they began to laugh at me. They were soon snorting too, and yawning, and turning away to watch the golf. And nodding, sarcastically, when I told them about the failings of the police, and how they had abused our supporters as we tried to save the dead. Now they handed over my statement. \u201cRead it and sign it, would you?\u201d But I wasn\u2019t happy. They had rewritten it; changed the meaning of certain incidents. Omitted key details. \u201cLike what?\u201d the officer said. Well, this happened, and this happened, I told them. He shook his head: \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Repeatedly, they informed me that I was mistaken; that I hadn\u2019t seen anything significant; that where I was in the stadium wasn\u2019t that bad, and that I would not go forward as a witness at the inquests. My account was probably best simply filed away. So if I just sign this statement, we\u2019ll be off, and you can get on with your life. As I grew increasingly angry, the detective with the remote control in his hands pumped up the volume on the TV. I was shouting to be heard in my own living room, and they were trying to drown me out. Eventually, I signed that statement and they were gone. I could not have realised at the time, in the summer of 1989, that I was caught up in one of the biggest attempts to pervert the course of justice in British history. This was happening in real time. So I simply shut the front door, told them to \u201cFuck off\u201d under my breath, went up to my bedroom, and broke down. But they had planted an awful, tiny seed of doubt in my mind. Where you were wasn\u2019t that bad. You haven\u2019t seen anything. Your recollection is faulty. They had come to steal my truth; but worse, they had implied that I was a fantasist; that I had overreacted. I must be soft, I thought: and soft in the head, too. As the months and years went by, and the 1991 inquests recorded a verdict of accidental death, that little seed of doubt took root, and grew, and grew. Perhaps I was mistaken. Maybe I had overreacted. But it didn\u2019t fit with the consistent nightmares, and the pile of corpses. It was like Belsen. Where you were wasn\u2019t that bad. I woke up on the kitchen floor one day, after blacking out. I had panic attacks on packed trains. One day, around 1993 or \u201994, washing up, or feeding the cat, or cleaning my teeth, I stopped up short and asked myself: \u201cCome on, were you even at Hillsborough?\u201d For years, intermittently, I would wake in a sweat that drenched the sheets. I would toss and turn so violently in my sleep that one day, I awoke with my feet on the pillow and my head hanging over the side of the bed. One morning in 1993, I woke up in a police cell. No longer able to contain my rage, I had kicked off at police officers in London, and been clapped in handcuffs. Now, sitting on a chair in the station, I was handed a charge sheet. Read it and sign it, they said. Ah, I said\u2026 I picked up their paperwork, and held it up to the light; turned it over, put it back on the desk. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d I said. They laughed at me too, at first; then they gave me a bed, and threw the charge in the bin. Then it happened again, in west London, in 1996. But this time, the duty sergeant who released me the following morning sat me down before I left. Gave me a cup of tea. Asked me what I was playing at. I seized my opportunity and said, \u201cI was at Hillsborough in 1989, and I hate coppers.\u201d He nodded, thoughtfully, and said: \u201cWell, I can understand that. But you can\u2019t carry on like this. You\u2019ll ruin your life.\u201d I sat there disarmed\u2026 stumped. Finally, someone in authority had heard me. It was a two-minute conversation, no more\u2026 but I walked out of that police station a reformed character. On Thursday, the Hillsborough families announced they would file a lawsuit against both South Yorkshire police and the West Midlands police. But what of the freemasons, those pantomime villains of the piece? In March 2015, David Duckenfield admitted what most of us had long suspected \u2013 he had been a freemason since the mid-70s. Remarkably, he was promoted to grand master of his lodge a year after Hillsborough. While the masons\u2019 role in the cover-up remains unclear \u2013 if indeed they had one \u2013 it is significant that Duckenfield sought to mitigate his gross negligence at Hillsborough by explaining that he was inexperienced as a match commander; that he had been dropped in at the deep end by Chief Constable Peter Wright. But Duckenfield was a limited officer; one who \u2013 some suspect \u2013 was only promoted to chief superintendent thanks to his masonic connections. The fact that Duckenfield was out of his depth at Hillsborough was certainly a factor in the deaths of the 96; perhaps this is the real indictment of a secret brotherhood pulling strings for people who would otherwise fail to prosper. There is much, now, for the public to ponder. This is the biggest cover-up in British history \u2013 or at least the largest ever exposed. And really, what was it all for? Was this crime committed, and British justice so contaminated, simply to save the reputations of a handful of incompetent or corrupt police officers? Certainly, it appears they were worth more to those in power than 96 dead football fans and their families; worth more than justice itself. But now the truth is out. And history will record that it was the police, and not us, who stole from the dead \u2013 they stole their lives, they stole the truth about their deaths, and they stole the next 27 years of the lives of their loved ones. They simply do not learn, the South Yorkshire police: there is a thread running from Orgreave, through Hillsborough, and on to the Rotherham child abuse scandal. There is the bill, too: their lies cost the taxpayer \u00a318m in legal fees in Warrington. Worse: the Independent Police Complaints Commission and Operation Resolve investigations into the cover-up are expected to conclude next year at a further cost of \u00a380m. The conspiracy to pervert the course of justice was but one part of a deceit: the other was a cultural deception. Football fans were the innocent party in this disaster, but we were then robbed of our stake in the game, and of a serious say in how it should be reformed. It was the FA who granted Hillsborough three successive FA cup semi-finals between 1987-89, despite the fact that the ground had ceased to be in possession of a valid safety certificate as of December 1981. But in 1991, the organisation signalled that it was the fans, and not itself, that should change. In its manifesto, a response to Hillsborough and the Taylor report, the FA\u2019s Blueprint for the Future of Football stated: \u201cthe response of most sectors has been to move upmarket so as to follow the affluent middle-class consumer \u2026 in his or her pursuits or aspirations. We strongly suggest that there is a message in this for football.\u201d In 1992, the FA-backed Premier League appeared. In its first, crucial deal with a TV broadcaster, it hopped into bed with BSkyB, owned by Rupert Murdoch, of course: the man ultimately responsible for the Sun\u2019s calumny. The scum had been cut adrift. Elsewhere, commentators talk of all-seater stadia as \u201cthe lasting legacy of the 96\u201d. While I accept that many of the bereaved welcome all-seater stadia, the families, more than anything, asked for justice, not a plastic seat. Moreover, the 96 died because they wanted to stand on a terrace; they believed in terrace culture. The price of a ticket for the Leppings Lane end of the stadium on 15 April 1989 was \u00a36; a seat ticket \u00a310 \u2013 the differential was not prohibitive. The truth is they died not because terraces are inherently unsafe, but because the Leppings Lane was unsafe. There is a sense now that a truth of this order must lead to change. On Tuesday, when the jury gave its determinations, BBC journalists with no personal connections to the disaster broke down in court and wept. It is not simply that the jury had got everything right \u2013 a remarkable achievement, given the complexity of the case: it is that Hillsborough was never simply a football disaster; it is the tragedy of this country in the 1980s. An entire class of people abandoned by those in power; a police force politicised, who literally turned their backs on people as they screamed for their lives; the transformation of a sport that was a culture into a rapacious, globalised business \u2013 sold off to the middle class, on the basis of a monumental injustice. On Tuesday night, I went to the Ship and Mitre pub in Liverpool. At 9pm we walked in to the sound of Bob Marley\u2019s Three Little Birds. Around me, survivors, journalists, the bereaved: singing, drinking, laughing; falling flat on their arses, pissed, and getting up again. A community of people, enjoying the quiet satisfaction that they might just have exposed the biggest miscarriage of justice in British history. There was satisfaction, too, in the fact that Thatcher had once again been undone: for if, as she claimed, there was no such thing as society, then how had this justice been won, and our country made the better for it? Our most important tools, as campaigners, were each other; the fact we stuck together as a community. It is no coincidence that no other city rejected Thatcherism to the same degree as Liverpool. The likes of Bernard Ingham, Boris Johnson and Simon Heffer disdain the idea of communities holding together, for fear we might take the powerful to task. And we have. Now accountability must follow. Just as old age did not save celebrity sex offenders from prison, nor should it spare former police officers and others who have conspired to pervert the course of justice on such a scale, and to sustain the lie over 27 years. It would be absurd if the passage of time were their defence now. It would be false to write that all is sweetness and light in Liverpool this week. There is a great deal of anger and frustration among the survivors I know; it will take months, perhaps years to subside. Perhaps it never will. Similarly, this justice is one of the great moments of my life, but it will not bring closure; because for many people who have suffered deep trauma, the notion of closure is false. It presumes that once traumatised, you are set off on a straight path; that if you simply keep going, then one day, eventually, you will reach a finish line. Cross it, and you have won. But post-traumatic stress condemns you to a circular track, on which you must simply keep going, round and round, for ever. The going might become easier, but there is no finish line. All you can hope to do is accommodate your trauma into your life as best you can. And if you do that, then you have won. Hillsborough will always be part of who I am and how I live. It is a torment and a privilege: having come so close to dying at 19, I haven\u2019t wasted my life. And I count so many wonderful people as friends. I am satisfied that I have been part of a campaign, as a journalist and a supporter, to expose this terrible truth. And I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to six women and three men from Warrington whose names I do not know. They have restored my faith in the country I live in; and in the idea of justice. And then there is Jenni Hicks. After we had both stood on the steps of St George\u2019s Hall in Liverpool, at Wednesday evening\u2019s vigil, in front of a crowd of 30,000, we retired to the Shankly hotel for a quiet drink, with families and survivors and campaigners. Jenni was gracious, as ever. In her hand, she held two red roses, for the daughters she lost. And she hugged me and told me that without justice for the fans, an unlawful killing verdict would have been meaningless to the families. I sat there with two brilliant Hillsborough campaigners, Jim Sharman and Chris Lightbown, and we watched her go into the night \u2013 go home with her two red roses. And we raised a glass to Sarah and Victoria, and to 94 other Liverpool fans, that they might rest in peace. For on 26 April 2016, we rewrote history. We made history. After 27 years and 11 days, finally, we got justice for the 96. @AdrianTempany Adrian Tempany\u2019s book, And the Sun Shines Now: How Hillsborough and the Premier League Changed Britain, is published by Faber on 2 June.

      "body": "<p>After 27 years, justice came in a few short moments. At just after 11am last Tuesday, Sir John Goldring took his seat in a specially converted courtroom in Warrington, to silence. There was no preamble from the coroner today; not even a perfunctory greeting. As the microphone sputtered to life, the most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-inquests-jury-says-96-victims-were-unlawfully-killed\">controversial inquests in British history were about to come to an end</a>. After two years, and nearly 300 days of evidence, from almost 1,000 witnesses, everything would rest on 14 questions \u2013 and on six women and three men from Warrington. The jury had given up two years of their lives to resolve this most bitter of disputes. Now, they were restricted to uttering a few simple words in response to the coroner. \u201cYes,\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d or \u201cIt is\u201d. But with those four words, they would rewrite history.</p> <p>A few hundred yards from court, across the Birchwood industrial park, in building 401, I was one of 200 people \u2013 survivors, the bereaved, and other campaigners \u2013 who filed into an annexe to watch a stream of the verdict, broadcast live. As we waited, quietly, a member of the inquest secretariat arrived to inform us that the annexe was technically a part of the courtroom itself: we should therefore show no emotion as the jury\u2019s determinations were announced. We ask you to be quiet and dignified, she said. A few seats along from me, Damian Kavanagh, a friend and fellow survivor, muttered: \u201cWe\u2019ve been dignified for 27 years.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually, the camera wobbled into focus, and the face of Sir John Goldring appeared. Unseen, off camera, the forewoman confirmed that the jury had arrived at its determinations to all 14 questions. Within moments, the debate over Hillsborough would be settled, once and for all. Here it was, in front of us on a TV screen \u2013 justice, finally. Like an intravenous drip \u2013 delivered drop by drop.</p> <p>I was 19 when I went to Hillsborough, to watch my team play an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest. A man, but in many respects still a boy; crushed to the brink of death behind the steel-mesh fence of pen 3. Many of the 96 died within feet of me. I survived, but, unable to move any part of my body from the neck down in the crush, I could do no more for these people than watch them die. I owed it to them to witness their final moments, to bear testimony; but I never thought I would live to see this day.</p> <p>I am sitting with my girlfriend, Deb, who was my girlfriend that day, and has seen me through years of anxiety, and anger. In the seats beside and in front of me are other survivors. Damian survived the crush in pen 4, aged 20. He had obtained a ticket for the game for his friend, David Rimmer, who died in the same pen. Tim Knowles was a 17-year-old A-level student, one of 10 friends from Formby who had gone to the match; only seven came back alive. Mike Bracken found himself crushed outside the ground, before entering through an exit gate. After buying a drink to recover, he was horrified to find thousands more fans converging on the tunnel to the already packed central pens. With no police officers deployed to seal the tunnel, Mike briefly tried to steer them away. But he was a 20-year-old fan in a jumper and jeans. There were no police there, the fans reasoned: so what could be the problem?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am sitting down but my knees give way. Tears are falling either side of my nose.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nick Braley is an Ipswich fan. In 1989, aged 19, he was a student at Sheffield Poly, excited to be going to an FA Cup semi-final, even as a neutral. He was crushed towards the front of pen 3 and survived through the luck of being turned side-on to the fence. He was traumatised for years. The West Midlands officers who took his statement, which was critical of the policing, dismissed him as \u201ca left-wing agitator\u201d.</p> <p>Richie Greaves was 23 when he was caught in one of the worst-affected parts of pen 3. He gave evidence to the first inquests, and came back to tell the same truth in Warrington. His wife, Lou, sits beside Deb: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to keep breathing,\u201d Lou says, squeezing Deb\u2019s arm gently. She is desperate to get her husband back.</p> <p>Now, the jury begin. Their answers to the first five questions \u2013 on the multiple failures in police planning and in the police operation on the day \u2013 are resolved quickly. A formality. But all hinges on questions 6 and 7.</p> <p>Q6: \u201cAre you satisfied, so that you are sure, that those who died in the disaster were unlawfully killed? Answer \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>We sit here not just as survivors, but as some of the accused. From the moment the inquests began, in March 2014, lawyers for the former match commanders at Hillsborough, led by John Beggs QC, have thrown vicious allegations on their behalf: that we were drunk, without tickets, badly behaved, aggressive and non-compliant. We sit quietly, and wonder if the jury has seen through their bile. It will not be easy: over three decades, we have been described as \u201canimalistic\u201d (Chief Constable Peter Wright), \u201ctanked-up yobs\u201d (Margaret Thatcher\u2019s press secretary Sir Bernard Ingham), and \u2013 quite simply \u2013 as \u201cmental\u201d (Paul Middup, Police Federation rep). Much of the public held us to be the people who pissed on brave coppers, or attacked them as they gave the kiss of life to stricken victims \u2013 all this while we were busy robbing the dead.</p> <p>These allegations, of course, were mostly carried in the Sun\u2019s infamous front-page story of 19 April 1989, under the headline The Truth. It was Kelvin MacKenzie\u2019s final choice as a banner headline; the first he had considered was: \u201cYou Scum\u201d.</p> <p>A cross-section of the scum are here today. Damian has spent his career as a pensions administrator. Tim is a newspaper sub-editor. Nick is an accountant. Richie runs his own courier firm. Mike is a digital executive and a CBE. I am an author and journalist. All of us, just your average football fans of the 1980s.</p> <p>Now the coroner reads out Q6 to the forewoman, still unseen. \u201cAre you satisfied, so that you are sure, that those who died in the disaster were unlawfully killed? Is your answer yes?\u201d</p> <p>The forewoman\u2019s voice is calm and reassuring, and wears lightly the huge responsibility. With the faintest trace of a lisp, she says: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8198ed415d39302382284fa766030b927673bda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8198ed415d39302382284fa766030b927673bda/0_69_2976_1786/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans are pulled to safety above the Leppings Lane terrace.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans are pulled to safety above the Leppings Lane terrace.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People scream, and jump to their feet. Mike\u2019s head begins to tremble in his hands. Richie turns towards me and punches the air. I turn slowly to Deb with tears in my eyes, and she smiles and rubs my back.</p> <p>Then the moment is gone. For the coroner is on to Q7: \u201cWas there any behaviour on the part of football supporters which caused or contributed to the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles?\u201d</p> <p>This is not just a question of truth now: people\u2019s lives are in the balance. To be unfairly blamed for killing people is an insult so grievous as to seriously disturb the mind. I know of one survivor, \u201cIan\u201d, who lost a friend in pen 3. In 2007, Ian became upset about the controversy generated by the appearance of Kelvin MacKenzie on Newsnight, and a few weeks later he hanged himself. There was Stephen Whittle, who gave his match ticket to a friend, who died. In February 2011, Stephen stepped in front of an express train. Two of my mates who survived pen 3 have tried to kill themselves; both, mercifully, survived. But we know that if this next question goes against us, people will almost certainly take their own lives. The jury cannot know this, of course. I look around at Deb, at Richie, at Damian and Lou. No one looks at me.</p> <p>The coroner: \u201cWas there any behaviour on the part of football supporters which caused or contributed to the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles? Is your answer No?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p> <p>People leap to their feet and punch the air. But again, momentary relief, for we are only halfway there. Now, having answered No, the jury are asked a supplementary question: was there any behaviour on the part of supporters that may have caused or contributed to the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles? That \u201cmay\u201d sets the threshold so low, we fear the jury are practically being urged to find against us. As Tim Knowles said over an anguished pint a few months ago: \u201cWhat kind of question is \u2018May have?\u2019 I might be found responsible for killing my friends on the basis of a vague, theoretical possibility.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On 15 April 1989, I walked into Hillsborough. An hour later I am caught somewhere between this life and the next</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But there is nothing vague about will happen to us: we will be vilified once more \u2013 for ever more \u2013 by the rightwing media and the police. We will be, for the first time in an official hearing, found culpable in killing our fellow fans. It is not the jury\u2019s fault: they have been bounced into this. But people will die on a Yes, they may have\u2026</p> <p>The coroner: \u201cWas there any behaviour on the part of supporters that may have caused or contributed to the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles? Is your answer No?\u201d</p> <p>I am sitting down but my knees give way. Tears are falling either side of my nose. The woman with the reassuring voice says \u201cIt is.\u201d</p> <p>And the place erupts.</p> <p>Compression asphyxia. Ninety-three times it is recorded that afternoon as the cause of death at Hillsborough. It is definitive, but it offers only a glimpse into how our supporters died, or how extensive were the failings of the police and South Yorkshire metropolitan ambulance service.</p> <p>On 15 April 1989, I walked down a tunnel into Hillsborough, and into the sunshine, thinking: \u201cWhere would you rather be on a day like this?\u201d An hour later, at just after 3pm, I am caught somewhere between this life and the next.</p> <p>The game has kicked off. I can see people in the north stand following it with their eyes. Others are fixated on the space around me, and pointing furiously, or running down the gangways to the pitch, shouting at police officers. But they are far away. Closer, a few feet away, people are dead on their feet. The air is thick with the smell of excrement and urine. Three men are changing colour, from a pale violet to a ghostly pallor. Some have vomit streaming from their nostrils. People are weeping. Others are gibbering, trying to black out what is happening. I am 19, and I know that I am about to die.</p> <p>As my brain begins to flood my body with endorphins, I am lifted above the crowd, in a bubble of warm water. It is strangely peaceful. Then shouting: rasping, aggressive shouting. In a Yorkshire accent: \u201cGet back you stupid bastards!\u201d</p> <p>Seconds, maybe minutes later, I open my eyes again. The sky is still blue, and the police have finally come through the gate in the perimeter fence. For the first time in an hour, I am standing up, untouched. Now, as I feel my body for broken ribs or bones, a group of people in front of me \u2013 who\u2019d had their backs to me throughout the crush, and who I thought were alive \u2013 simply keel over and hit the concrete. A heap of tangled corpses piles up off the ground, three feet high. After a few seconds, I see a limb move and realise someone is alive in there. One police officer who comes through the gate later says that the scene \u201cwas like Belsen\u201d.</p> <p>Over the next half hour, as the police rush to get word to the BBC, the FA and Liverpool FC\u2019s own lawyer that Liverpool fans had caused the disaster by storming the gates, I and hundreds of other survivors are kicking down advertising boards and picking up bodies. A group of us sprint to a dead man who is lying partially naked by the goalline. We put him on a board and run towards the Forest end, in search of ambulances. When none materialise, we exit the stadium via a ramp and are directed by police into the gymnasium, now a temporary mortuary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23af977f8b9677437188ff1a3656a27bd650ced6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23af977f8b9677437188ff1a3656a27bd650ced6/0_84_3508_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adrian Tempany (labelled G) and other supporters use advertising boards as makeshift stretchers at Hillsborough.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adrian Tempany (labelled G) and other supporters use advertising boards as makeshift stretchers at Hillsborough.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Behind a badminton net, rows and rows of corpses under paper sheets, a policeman\u2019s helmet on each chest. Coppers are sat around the edge of the gym, on chairs or on the floor, sobbing, hysterical. Someone is headbutting a wall. On the floor, two or three groups of people are each tending to a casualty: some are beating their patient\u2019s chest, furiously, or blowing air into their mouth. Another man is kneeling, cradling the head of a lad in a black jacket, rocking him backwards and forwards gently, as he weeps. \u201cHe\u2019s my brother,\u201d he says, sobbing. \u201cHe\u2019s my brother.\u201d But he isn\u2019t waking up.</p> <p>I am holding the right hand of the dead man we picked up. It is cold, and greased in sweat. He is heavy, but I am reluctant to let him go. Someone leans over one of the casualties on the floor and begins to administer the last rites. And a voice in my head simply says: \u201cYou need to get out of here, now, otherwise you\u2019ll go mad.\u201d</p> <p>For the next two decades, many survivors would struggle to retain their sanity. But it wasn\u2019t us who had lost our senses: it was the British establishment.</p> <p>Chief superintendent David Duckenfield, the match commander, did not lie alone, of course: this deceit was not simply the work of a bunch of bent coppers, but the product of a political culture debased. For years, historians have routinely rubbished the 70s as the decade that shamed us \u2013 10 years of loon pants and luminous food; Britain at its most unhinged. But Hillsborough, a stain on British history like no other, can only be fully understood as part of the Thatcher era that gave rise to it. It was she who gave political cover to the South Yorkshire police, after they attacked the miners at Orgreave in 1984 and then tried to fit up dozens of them on a charge of riot \u2013 immunity their reward for breaking the strike. And as Kenneth Clarke MP has admitted, Thatcher had declared football fans as an enemy within: not football hooligans \u2013 football fans.</p> <p>On 4 August 1989, Lord Justice Taylor produced his interim report into the causes of the disaster. He concluded that the main cause was overcrowding, and the main reason was the failure of police control. Here, essentially, was the truth the jury found in Warrington last week \u2013 laid before the public in August 1989. But the public didn\u2019t get to see it first: Thatcher and her cabinet did.</p> <p>On 1 August 1989, the report was presented to the home secretary, Douglas Hurd, who sent <a href=\"http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/report/main-section/part-2/chapter-6/page-8/\">an internal memo</a> to Thatcher. The chief constable, Hurd thought, will \u201chave to resign\u201d, as the \u201cenormity of the disaster, and the extent to which the inquiry blames the police, demand this\u201d. Hurd requested Thatcher\u2019s support for his own statement, in which he would \u201cwelcome unreservedly the broad thrust of the report\u201d. Thatcher replied: \u201cWhat do we mean by \u2018welcoming the broad thrust of the report\u2019? The broad thrust is devastating criticism of the police. Is that for us to welcome? \u2026 Surely we welcome the thoroughness of the report and its recommendations. MT\u201d.</p> <p>And, at a stroke, justice was denied. Hurd had seen the rug pulled from under his feet. Now, he did not, could not, call for Chief Constable Peter Wright\u2019s resignation \u2013 a move that would have left South Yorkshire police no option but to accept full responsibility. Suitably emboldened, they came out fighting, for 27 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef742589419a55fc1539bcb0fb70262624dd430c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef742589419a55fc1539bcb0fb70262624dd430c/0_79_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tributes are placed at Anfield, two days after Hillsborough.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tributes are placed at Anfield, two days after Hillsborough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Kemp/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Afew days after the disaster, I walk in to my doctor\u2019s surgery. I am struggling to breathe properly, but I know, as I sit in the waiting room, that it isn\u2019t my body that\u2019s in need of attention.</p> <p>After half an hour I am called in by a GP \u2013 old, patrician; pinstripe suit and spectacles. I tell him, quietly, that I was at Hillsborough on Saturday and my chest hurts. Hmm, he says. He presses a stethoscope to my skin, then sits down to write a referral for an x-ray. But he does not look at me. As I button up my shirt I am looking at his bald head. Look at me, I am saying, silently. Look at me, you bastard. But he won\u2019t.</p> <p>Eventually, he hands over the referral while setting his eyes off to my right, and says \u2013 mumbles \u2013 \u201cDo you\u2026 do you want to talk to anyone about this?\u201d I pause for a few moments, then say no. I get up to go, and am almost at the door when he says: \u201cIt does look as if the Liverpool fans were to blame then, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d I turn to look at him, but all I feel is embarrassment \u2013 not for myself, but for him. \u201cOh well, good luck,\u201d he says, brightly.</p> <p>So it is that the first professional people to talk to me after Hillsborough are the West Midlands police. The WMP were initially appointed to assist the Taylor inquiry, and were retained as advisers to the wretched coroner, Stefan Popper, at the original inquests, between late 1990 and March 1991.</p> <p>In July 1989, two plainclothes detectives arrived at my home in Stevenage. It was a Sunday, around 2pm, and the golf was on the TV. They sat me down, told me they would write down my statement by hand, and that I should then read it, and, if I was happy, sign it. So I began to tell them what had happened, and they began to laugh at me. They were soon snorting too, and yawning, and turning away to watch the golf. And nodding, sarcastically, when I told them about the failings of the police, and how they had abused our supporters as we tried to save the dead.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is much, now, for the public to ponder. This is the biggest cover-up in British history</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now they handed over my statement. \u201cRead it and sign it, would you?\u201d</p> <p>But I wasn\u2019t happy. They had rewritten it; changed the meaning of certain incidents. Omitted key details. \u201cLike what?\u201d the officer said. Well, this happened, and this happened, I told them. He shook his head: \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <p>Repeatedly, they informed me that I was mistaken; that I hadn\u2019t seen anything significant; that where I was in the stadium wasn\u2019t that bad, and that I would not go forward as a witness at the inquests. My account was probably best simply filed away. So if I just sign this statement, we\u2019ll be off, and you can get on with your life.</p> <p>As I grew increasingly angry, the detective with the remote control in his hands pumped up the volume on the TV. I was shouting to be heard in my own living room, and they were trying to drown me out. Eventually, I signed that statement and they were gone. I could not have realised at the time, in the summer of 1989, that I was caught up in one of the biggest attempts to pervert the course of justice in British history. This was happening in real time. So I simply shut the front door, told them to \u201cFuck off\u201d under my breath, went up to my bedroom, and broke down.</p> <p>But they had planted an awful, tiny seed of doubt in my mind. <em>Where you were wasn\u2019t that bad. You haven\u2019t seen anything. Your recollection is faulty.</em> They had come to steal my truth; but worse, they had implied that I was a fantasist; that I had overreacted. I must be soft, I thought: and soft in the head, too.</p> <p>As the months and years went by, and the 1991 inquests recorded a verdict of accidental death, that little seed of doubt took root, and grew, and grew. Perhaps I was mistaken. Maybe I had overreacted. But it didn\u2019t fit with the consistent nightmares, and the pile of corpses. <em>It was like Belsen</em>. <em>Where you were wasn\u2019t that bad. </em></p> <p>I woke up on the kitchen floor one day, after blacking out. I had panic attacks on packed trains. One day, around 1993 or \u201994, washing up, or feeding the cat, or cleaning my teeth, I stopped up short and asked myself: \u201cCome on, were you even <em>at</em> Hillsborough?\u201d</p> <p>For years, intermittently, I would wake in a sweat that drenched the sheets. I would toss and turn so violently in my sleep that one day, I awoke with my feet on the pillow and my head hanging over the side of the bed.</p> <p>One morning in 1993, I woke up in a police cell. No longer able to contain my rage, I had kicked off at police officers in London, and been clapped in handcuffs. Now, sitting on a chair in the station, I was handed a charge sheet. Read it and sign it, they said. Ah, I said\u2026 I picked up their paperwork, and held it up to the light; turned it over, put it back on the desk. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d I said.</p> <p>They laughed at me too, at first; then they gave me a bed, and threw the charge in the bin.</p> <p>Then it happened again, in west London, in 1996. But this time, the duty sergeant who released me the following morning sat me down before I left. Gave me a cup of tea. Asked me what I was playing at. I seized my opportunity and said, \u201cI was at Hillsborough in 1989, and I hate coppers.\u201d He nodded, thoughtfully, and said: \u201cWell, I can understand that. But you can\u2019t carry on like this. You\u2019ll ruin your life.\u201d</p> <p>I sat there disarmed\u2026 stumped. Finally, someone in authority had heard me. It was a two-minute conversation, no more\u2026 but I walked out of that police station a reformed character.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c065718bafebdf913b7c861323803cc7cc108d3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c065718bafebdf913b7c861323803cc7cc108d3f/0_272_4572_2743/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Labour MP Andy Burnham hugs Adrian Tempany after hearing the conclusions of the Hillsborough inquest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labour MP Andy Burnham hugs Adrian Tempany after hearing the conclusions of the Hillsborough inquest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Thursday, the Hillsborough families announced they would file a lawsuit against both South Yorkshire police and the West Midlands police. But what of the freemasons, those pantomime villains of the piece? In March 2015, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/12/hillsborough-commander-denies-police-conspiracy-to-blame-liverpool-fans\">David Duckenfield admitted </a>what most of us had long suspected \u2013 he had been a freemason since the mid-70s. Remarkably, he was promoted to grand master of his lodge a year after Hillsborough.</p> <p>While the masons\u2019 role in the cover-up remains unclear \u2013 if indeed they had one \u2013 it is significant that Duckenfield sought to mitigate his gross negligence at Hillsborough by explaining that he was inexperienced as a match commander; that he had been dropped in at the deep end by Chief Constable Peter Wright. But Duckenfield was a limited officer; one who \u2013 some suspect \u2013 was only promoted to chief superintendent thanks to his masonic connections. The fact that Duckenfield was out of his depth at Hillsborough was certainly a factor in the deaths of the 96; perhaps this is the real indictment of a secret brotherhood pulling strings for people who would otherwise fail to prosper.</p> <p>There is much, now, for the public to ponder. This is the biggest cover-up in British history \u2013 or at least the largest ever exposed. And really, what was it all for? Was this crime committed, and British justice so contaminated, simply to save the reputations of a handful of incompetent or corrupt police officers? Certainly, it appears they were worth more to those in power than 96 dead football fans and their families; worth more than justice itself.</p> <p>But now the truth is out. And history will record that it was the police, and not us, who stole from the dead \u2013 they stole their lives, they stole the truth about their deaths, and they stole the next 27 years of the lives of their loved ones. They simply do not learn, the South Yorkshire police: there is a thread running from Orgreave, through Hillsborough, and on to the Rotherham child abuse scandal. There is the bill, too: their lies cost the taxpayer \u00a318m in legal fees in Warrington. Worse: the Independent Police Complaints Commission and Operation Resolve investigations into the cover-up are expected to conclude next year at a further cost of \u00a380m.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/28/when-you-walk-through-a-storm\">'The greatest victory Liverpool has ever won': the city reacts to the Hillsborough verdict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The conspiracy to pervert the course of justice was but one part of a deceit: the other was a cultural deception. Football fans were the innocent party in this disaster, but we were then robbed of our stake in the game, and of a serious say in how it should be reformed. It was the FA who granted Hillsborough three successive FA cup semi-finals between 1987-89, despite the fact that the ground had ceased to be in possession of a valid safety certificate as of December 1981. But in 1991, the organisation signalled that it was the fans, and not itself, that should change. In its manifesto, a response to Hillsborough and the Taylor report, the FA\u2019s <em>Blueprint for the Future of Football </em>stated: \u201cthe response of most sectors has been to move upmarket so as to follow the affluent middle-class consumer \u2026 in his or her pursuits or aspirations. We strongly suggest that there is a message in this for football.\u201d</p> <p>In 1992, the FA-backed Premier League appeared. In its first, crucial deal with a TV broadcaster, it hopped into bed with BSkyB, owned by Rupert Murdoch, of course: the man ultimately responsible for the <em>Sun</em>\u2019s calumny. The scum had been cut adrift.</p> <p>Elsewhere, commentators talk of all-seater stadia as \u201cthe lasting legacy of the 96\u201d. While I accept that many of the bereaved welcome all-seater stadia, the families, more than anything, asked for justice, not a plastic seat. Moreover, the 96 died because they wanted to stand on a terrace; they believed in terrace culture. The price of a ticket for the Leppings Lane end of the stadium on 15 April 1989 was \u00a36; a seat ticket \u00a310 \u2013 the differential was not prohibitive. The truth is they died not because terraces are inherently unsafe, but because the Leppings Lane was unsafe.</p> <p>There is a sense now that a truth of this order must lead to change. On Tuesday, when the jury gave its determinations, BBC journalists with no personal connections to the disaster broke down in court and wept. It is not simply that the jury had got everything right \u2013 a remarkable achievement, given the complexity of the case: it is that Hillsborough was never simply a football disaster; it is the tragedy of this country in the 1980s. An entire class of people abandoned by those in power; a police force politicised, who literally turned their backs on people as they screamed for their lives; the transformation of a sport that was a culture into a rapacious, globalised business \u2013 sold off to the middle class, on the basis of a monumental injustice.</p> <p>On Tuesday night, I went to the Ship and Mitre pub in Liverpool. At 9pm we walked in to the sound of Bob Marley\u2019s Three Little Birds. Around me, survivors, journalists, the bereaved: singing, drinking, laughing; falling flat on their arses, pissed, and getting up again. A community of people, enjoying the quiet satisfaction that they might just have exposed the biggest miscarriage of justice in British history.</p> <p>There was satisfaction, too, in the fact that Thatcher had once again been undone: for if, as she claimed, there was no such thing as society, then how had this justice been won, and our country made the better for it? Our most important tools, as campaigners, were each other; the fact we stuck together as a community. It is no coincidence that no other city rejected Thatcherism to the same degree as Liverpool. The likes of Bernard Ingham, Boris Johnson and Simon Heffer disdain the idea of communities holding together, for fear we might take the powerful to task. And we have. Now accountability must follow. Just as old age did not save celebrity sex offenders from prison, nor should it spare former police officers and others who have conspired to pervert the course of justice on such a scale, and to sustain the lie over 27 years. It would be absurd if the passage of time were their defence now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d588e0d56992a6c71f0fa1125a8458b5957233e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d588e0d56992a6c71f0fa1125a8458b5957233e5/160_58_1692_2616/647.jpg\" alt=\"Jenni Hicks, who lost her two daughters at Hillsborough.\" width=\"647\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jenni Hicks, who lost her two daughters at Hillsborough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Thompson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It would be false to write that all is sweetness and light in Liverpool this week. There is a great deal of anger and frustration among the survivors I know; it will take months, perhaps years to subside. Perhaps it never will. Similarly, this justice is one of the great moments of my life, but it will not bring closure; because for many people who have suffered deep trauma, the notion of closure is false. It presumes that once traumatised, you are set off on a straight path; that if you simply keep going, then one day, eventually, you will reach a finish line. Cross it, and you have won. But post-traumatic stress condemns you to a circular track, on which you must simply keep going, round and round, for ever. The going might become easier, but there is no finish line. All you can hope to do is accommodate your trauma into your life as best you can. And if you do that, then you have won.</p> <p>Hillsborough will always be part of who I am and how I live. It is a torment and a privilege: having come so close to dying at 19, I haven\u2019t wasted my life. And I count so many wonderful people as friends. I am satisfied that I have been part of a campaign, as a journalist and a supporter, to expose this terrible truth. And I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to six women and three men from Warrington whose names I do not know. They have restored my faith in the country I live in; and in the idea of justice.</p> <p>And then there is Jenni Hicks. After we had both stood on the steps of St George\u2019s Hall in Liverpool, at Wednesday evening\u2019s vigil, in front of a crowd of 30,000, we retired to the Shankly hotel for a quiet drink, with families and survivors and campaigners. Jenni was gracious, as ever. In her hand, she held two red roses, for the daughters she lost. And she hugged me and told me that without justice for the fans, an unlawful killing verdict would have been meaningless to the families. I sat there with two brilliant Hillsborough campaigners, Jim Sharman and Chris Lightbown, and we watched her go into the night \u2013 go home with her two red roses. And we raised a glass to Sarah and Victoria, and to 94 other Liverpool fans, that they might rest in peace.</p> <p>For on 26 April 2016, we rewrote history. We made history. After 27 years and 11 days, finally, we got justice for the 96.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/adriantempany\"><em>@AdrianTempany</em></a><em> </em></p> <ul> <li><em>Adrian Tempany\u2019s book, </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/and-the-sun-shines-now.html\"><em>And the Sun Shines Now: How Hillsborough and the Premier League Changed Britain</em></a><em>, is published by Faber on 2 June</em>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/08/how-football-lost-touch-young-fans\">Read an extract here</a><br /></li> <li><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/and-the-sun-shines-now.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">And the Sun Shines Now</a> by Adrian Tempany (Faber &amp; Faber, \u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "The UK food scene is increasingly dominated by social media stars, healthy-eating advocates and tech-savvy startups devising innovative ways of delivering to our doors, according to a new list of 50 influential foodies released last week. The list, compiled by advertising agency Telegraph Hill and featured in the Grocer magazine, suggests that those seeking power and influence in today\u2019s food world would greatly benefit from being fresh-faced, Instagram-literate and more interested in the nutritional benefits of food than as an opportunity for indulgence. The No 2 spot is taken by the fitness trainer turned cookery writer Joe Wicks, who used the popularity of his Instagram feed \u2013 and a catchy diet plan \u2013 to catapult himself to the top of the bestseller lists at the start of this year. More established food personalities, who rose to renown the old-fashioned way through TV and print publishing, still feature strongly on the list \u2013 Jamie Oliver comes in at No 1 and Nigella Lawson, Gordon Ramsay and Paul Hollywood all appear in the top 20. But the digital generation is hot on their heels and several names here, such as Madeleine Shaw or Izy Hossack, only started reaching big audiences in the past couple of years. It\u2019s not all aspiration and digital froth: the list is counterweighted by figures from the business end of food who are unlikely to be tweeting selfies, spiralising courgettes or sipping spinach juice any time soon. Much of the top 20 is occupied by supermarket bosses \u2013 Andy Clarke of Asda is at No 5, just ahead of Dave Lewis of Tesco \u2013 despite the storms that have assailed the major retailers in recent years. Lurking not far below (at 18 and 19) are the chief executives of Lidl and Aldi, the discounters busily gobbling up market share. If you have been struck by the sudden ubiquity of Deliveroo couriers in UK cities in recent months, you won\u2019t be surprised by the inclusion of the company\u2019s co-founder Will Shu at No 48. Deliveroo\u2019s success \u2013 the restaurant delivery firm raised \u00a3127m of development cash in 2015 \u2013 reflects the growing relevance of food startups that take their cues from the tech industry: the UK heads of online delivery companies Just Eat and HelloFresh also feature in the top 50. The list is far from conclusive. Compiled by evaluating factors such as real-world power, online activity, traditional media presence and brand strength, it arrives at some rather odd assessments. Is TV farmer Jimmy Doherty (No 12) really more influential than activist Jack Monroe (17) or Heston Blumenthal (30)? Symmetry Breakfast is a charming Instagram account with a book on the way, but in terms of real-world power it doesn\u2019t punch very hard. For all its shortcomings, the list does highlight interesting developments, most strikingly the rise of the clean-eating movement, with its promise to cater for an ever-expanding catalogue of food intolerances. And it has forced the big food manufacturers, retailers and restaurants to react to a customer base that increasingly sees food in nutritional terms rather than as an end in itself. RISING STARS JOE WICKS The Instagram king (No 2) When Joe Wicks signed a book deal at the start of 2015, he had a mere 75,000 followers on Instagram. Now the 30-year-old food-and-fitness guru from Surrey, who brands himself the Body Coach \u2013 his diet plan combines eating with working out \u2013 commands more than a million Instagram followers, a statistic that has helped him sell more than 500,000 copies of his book Lean in 15 since December and land his own TV series on Channel 4. It shows just how powerful Instagram (the social media platform of choice for gourmands) can be in crowning a new generation of food royalty. ELLA WOODWARD The doyenne of healthy eating (10) Five years ago, Ella Woodward, daughter of the former Labour minister Shaun Woodward and Camilla Sainsbury (of the supermarket dynasty), was diagnosed with postural tachycardia syndrome. In response she embraced a healthier diet and began documenting her culinary forays \u2013 think sweet potato brownies and kale smoothies \u2013 on her blog Deliciously Ella. Now Woodward has produced two bestselling cookbooks, runs cookery classes and has opened a cafe in central London. Her rapid evolution from blogger to industry player is, in part, a matter of timing: she started posting just as \u201cclean eating\u201d was becoming a mainstream phenomenon. WILL SHU The food delivery disrupter (48) Twenty-three per cent of adults in the UK order a takeaway once a week or more, according to a study by Mintel, and yet the range and quality of takeaway food tends to be very limited compared to what\u2019s on offer if you eat out. Disappointed with the state of British takeaways after moving to London in 2004, former banker Will Shu decided to do something about it. Three years ago he co-founded Deliveroo, a delivery service that has lured higher-end chain restaurants such as Gourmet Burger Kitchen into the takeaway market. Much thought has been put into timing, packaging and delivery systems, to ensure dishes don\u2019t spoil en route. The proliferation of Deliveroo couriers around the country suggests that Shu is on to something. NADIYA HUSSAIN The reality TV star (36) You don\u2019t always need an Instagram account to become a food celebrity in 2016: it\u2019s still possible to make it via the quaint medium of reality TV. Last October, Nadiya Hussain, a mother-of-three living in Leeds, won the sixth series of the Great British Bake Off. Hussain has since become a columnist for the Times magazine, signed publishing deals and baked an orange drizzle cake for the Queen\u2019s 90th birthday. Last week she announced her own travel cookery show, The Chronicles of Nadiya, on BBC1. WHO\u2019S WHO IN THE GREAT BRITISH FOOD CHAIN 1. Jamie Oliver, celebrity chef, TV presenter and author 2.

The rest of us can relax in our sweatpants, and wait for some prize sartorial entertainment. I mean, last year Rihanna interpreted the 2015 dress code of \u201cChinese white tie\u201d as \u201cdress as an omelette\u201d, so the artistic expression bar is pretty high.

Do Anna and Jony lock horns over, like, napkin swans? Surely Tay Tay will have used that time doodling on the minutes pad and passing the biscuit plate to Nicolas to make sure she nabs the best Vuitton dress. In her 73 Questions video on the Vogue site, Taylor Swift \u2013 who is co-hosting the night \u2013 said she was going to go dressed as \u201ca robot with a sword\u201d, but we\u2019re hoping Nicolas talked her into Look 34 instead.

She likes Gucci at the moment, and she\u2019s threatening Alexa Chung with a land grab on the pie-crust collar. So, a fierce, I\u2019m-no one\u2019s-arm-candy Gucci gown would tick all boxes.

Sleep disorders can lead to fatigue, anxiety, depression and poor daytime performance in both physical and mental tasks. Drugs can help, but they can also have negative effects on your daily life. Fortunately help is at hand. Psychologists have found that simply playing relaxing music at bedtime can alleviate sleep disorders for many people. Relaxing music reduces the amount of the stress hormone noradrenaline in your system, reducing your level of vigilance and arousal and allowing you to sleep better. Psychologist Laszlo Harmat gathered together 94 students with sleeping problems. One group was given relaxing classical music to listen to at bedtime, a second group was supplied with an audiobook, and the third received nothing. Those with the music or audiobooks were asked to play them every night for 45 minutes just before they went to bed. After three weeks, 30 of the 35 students in the music-listening group were transformed into good sleepers. Listening to audiobooks helped far fewer people: only nine out of 30 became good sleepers. The students were also rated as to how depressed they were before and after the test. The depressive symptoms of the music-listening group decreased substantially, but the audiobooks didn\u2019t have the same effect. Music can also help older people sleep better. In 2003 researchers Hui-Ling Lai and Marion Good carried out a similar study on a group of people aged between 60 and 83 years old who had sleeping problems, and once again the bedtime music worked its magic. Half of the music-listening group became good sleepers. If you want to try relaxing bedtime music for yourself, you\u2019ll find that plenty of the most relaxing classical/ jazz/blues albums are readily available and, of course, you can easily make your own playlists. It\u2019s important to get the volume right: too low and it\u2019s irritating, too loud and you can\u2019t sleep.

      "bodyText": "The Ninth 22 Charlotte Street, London W1 (020 3019 0880). Meal for two, including drinks and service: \u00a370 - \u00a3110 Jun Tanaka\u2019s restaurant on London\u2019s Charlotte Street does not have the most imaginative of names. It\u2019s called The Ninth because it\u2019s the ninth restaurant with which he\u2019s been involved. Then again, bluntness can be its own reward. Frankly, in an age when there are grown men who think Sexy Fish is a good name for a restaurant \u2013 rather than, say, an extremely niche category on Pornhub for people who get off on looking at trout \u2013 I\u2019ll happily settle for bland. Lord save us from marketing departments trying too hard. For all its utility, the name quietly tell us an interesting story about the state of culinary ambition in Britain right now. A few years ago a chef like Tanaka, who has worked at the Capital with Eric Chavot, Le Gavroche and The Square, would be expected to rise through his eight previous brigades to emerge as the head chef of his ninth which would look like all the ones that had gone before. It would be a white tabled-clothed restaurant, the kind where dishes are plated on pieces of porcelain like egg shell, and delivered with hushed reverence to tables of long-married couples \u2013 the only ones who can afford the bill \u2013 who no longer have anything to say to each other. It would be the kind of place where nobody ever admitted to farting. Instead we are getting chefs like Tanaka, sodden with both technique and talent, who are arriving at this point, their interest in formality now happily misplaced. They just want to feed. And so The Ninth, a perfectly formed little restaurant with food that swings between \u201cbloody lovely\u201d and \u201coh my gosh\u201d. Sure, it ticks lots of boxes marked London 2016. The bare brick walls leave you wondering if all those brilliant Polish plasterers have finally taken offence at the Brexit campaign and pissed off home. There are hefty leather banquettes and dark wood floors and those cage things over the bar that please the eye, but must be a nightmare to stack with glasses. Naturally, the waiter takes your order without a notepad and the dishes are all made for sharing. There are many you will want to keep for yourself. The joys start early with a puffed up pillow of freshly made pitta, the shape of an inflamed kidney, the crisp outer skin crusted with oregano and salt. You tear it apart to reveal a fluffy crumb and a smell like your table was suddenly a baker\u2019s shop. It is a classy opener. We hold on to some of that bread to dredge through the fiery watercress pur\u00e9e that lies beneath two perfect orbs of oxtail croquette, the strands of long-braised meat spun through with fresh green herbs. If this was served as a cocktail party canap\u00e9, I would force whoever had the tray to stand in the corner of the room, their escape blocked, until I had cleared the lot. At lunch there\u2019s a short list of dishes at \u00a317 for two plates and \u00a321 for three. From that, a crispy duck, blood orange and pomegranate salad feels like a playful riff on duck a l\u2019orange, the high fruity notes gently forcing the bird into submission. A sizable ravioli of salt cod with a liquid egg yolk at its heart, is one of those dishes that puts technique in the service of pure pleasure. It\u2019s a whole bunch of complicated things \u2013 the making of a pasta as silky as a Terry Thomas cravat, the balance to the cod brandade, the cooking time that leaves the egg yolk flowing across the plate \u2013 resulting in comfort. It\u2019s nursery food for grown-ups. From the raw and cured list, there\u2019s a whole uncooked mackerel fillet, lightly flamed so that the high smoky tang of a bonfire hovers over it. Then the fish has been dressed with a fine dice of capers, cucumber and dill, the acidity both setting the protein and keeping the whack of the seashore in its place. Sizable pieces of celeriac are charcoal roasted and served up with smoked almonds and wild garlic. Best of all is a plate of ox cheeks, given the salt beef treatment. This is a truly spectacular plateful. Cheeks do a lot of work so they can be tough old blighters. Unlike salt beef from brisket, which tumbles away into strands, this is tender to the fork but maintains its own internal tension. The pieces of cheek are topped with gossamer slices of bone marrow, rings of morel and podded green beans, like spring has dropped its nubile buds all over your plate. There is a scoop of finely acidulated and diced onions and green herbs to cut through the heftiness of the meat. But the killer detail is the limpid pool of a perfectly clarified oxtail consomm\u00e9 in which all this sits; it\u2019s the very essence of moo. If this liquid, lip-smackingly rich in gelatine, dropped below room temperature you just know it would form a jelly, as any good beef consomm\u00e9 should. Oh how I would love to get all those hucksters and charlatans currently flogging bone broth as if it was a thing (it\u2019s called stock) to line up, sip some of this, and then realise they are wasting everybody\u2019s time and money. Then they could head off to do something more socially useful, like robbing banks. It barely needs saying, but to make a dish like this you need the kind of formal training that only Tanaka\u2019s eight restaurant-long career so far could gift him. Not everything thrills. From that lunch menu a dense, brassica nettle \u201crisotto\u201d, shoved in inverted commas because it\u2019s made with pearly grains of fregola, is slippery and heavy rather than comforting. You can tell it\u2019s good for you, without appreciating it being so. An overly heavy hand with the herbs in a rosemary ice cream makes it taste like a chemically scented candle smells. It\u2019s distracting. But the tarte tatin for two that it accompanies is a beautiful thing, all chewy caramelised pastry, and apples that quiver and fall apart when nudged with a spoon. Ask for it with their vanilla instead. The Ninth is not a unique restaurant in London right now. I can think of a number of places \u2013 Piquet, Blanchette and Terroirs, for starters \u2013 delivering great food at a reasonable price in relaxed surroundings. But there is a precision and, at times, an understated brilliance to this restaurant which does set it apart. Let\u2019s put it this way: I don\u2019t think Tanaka need move on to his 10th establishment any day soon. Jay\u2019s news bites \u25a0 Generally, numbers slip into restaurants\u2019 names courtesy of the address. Hence: 40 Maltby Street, in a railway arch south of London\u2019s Tower Bridge. This is a wine business, with a food operation attached. But for a secondary trade the robust cooking is far better than it ever need be. The changing menu throws up the likes of skate wing alongside salsify fritters or black pudding with salt cod and rabbit (40maltbystreet.com). \u25a0 An intriguing pop-up called Thornback comes to Leeds from 12-15 May, led by Brett Barnes, formerly of the city\u2019s Reliance pub. He will cook a six-course British seafood menu with Ronnie Murray, group head chef for Mark Hix. Tickets are available from leedsindiefood.co.uk. \u25a0 Harrogate restaurant Norse has introduced airline style \u201cdynamic\u201d pricing to take on the city\u2019s chains. On Mondays prices will be discounted by 25% , with the discount dropping 5% each day until Friday. Owner Paul Rawlinson said he\u2019d consider the impact of the trial at the end of May (norserestaurant.co.uk). Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1",

It would be a white tabled-clothed restaurant, the kind where dishes are plated on pieces of porcelain like egg shell, and delivered with hushed reverence to tables of long-married couples \u2013 the only ones who can afford the bill \u2013 who no longer have anything to say to each other. It would be the kind of place where nobody ever admitted to farting.</p> <p>Instead we are getting chefs like Tanaka, sodden with both technique and talent, who are arriving at this point, their interest in formality now happily misplaced. They just want to feed. And so The Ninth, a perfectly formed little restaurant with food that swings between \u201cbloody lovely\u201d and \u201coh my gosh\u201d. Sure, it ticks lots of boxes marked London 2016. The bare brick walls leave you wondering if all those brilliant Polish plasterers have finally taken offence at the Brexit campaign and pissed off home. There are hefty leather banquettes and dark wood floors and those cage things over the bar that please the eye, but must be a nightmare to stack with glasses. Naturally, the waiter takes your order without a notepad and the dishes are all made for sharing. There are many you will want to keep for yourself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"309de8125516684147ac92845d50718c07a2ac0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/309de8125516684147ac92845d50718c07a2ac0e/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An oblong plate of mackerel tightly sliced and sprinkled with cucumber and capers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The high smoky tang of a bonfire hovers over it\u2019: the flamed mackerel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The joys start early with a puffed up pillow of freshly made pitta, the shape of an inflamed kidney, the crisp outer skin crusted with oregano and salt. You tear it apart to reveal a fluffy crumb and a smell like your table was suddenly a baker\u2019s shop. It is a classy opener. We hold on to some of that bread to dredge through the fiery watercress pur\u00e9e that lies beneath two perfect orbs of oxtail croquette, the strands of long-braised meat spun through with fresh green herbs. If this was served as a cocktail party canap\u00e9, I would force whoever had the tray to stand in the corner of the room, their escape blocked, until I had cleared the lot.</p> <p>At lunch there\u2019s a short list of dishes at \u00a317 for two plates and \u00a321 for three. From that, a crispy duck, blood orange and pomegranate salad feels like a playful riff on duck a l\u2019orange, the high fruity notes gently forcing the bird into submission. A sizable ravioli of salt cod with a liquid egg yolk at its heart, is one of those dishes that puts technique in the service of pure pleasure. It\u2019s a whole bunch of complicated things \u2013 the making of a pasta as silky as a Terry Thomas cravat, the balance to the cod brandade, the cooking time that leaves the egg yolk flowing across the plate \u2013 resulting in comfort. It\u2019s nursery food for grown-ups.</p> <p>From the raw and cured list, there\u2019s a whole uncooked mackerel fillet, lightly flamed so that the high smoky tang of a bonfire hovers over it. Then the fish has been dressed with a fine dice of capers, cucumber and dill, the acidity both setting the protein and keeping the whack of the seashore in its place. Sizable pieces of celeriac are charcoal roasted and served up with smoked almonds and wild garlic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3147d0a2dfda4b8ca3e06da6c8cd534f35fac5ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3147d0a2dfda4b8ca3e06da6c8cd534f35fac5ad/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bowl of ox cheeks with green beans\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Best possible taste: the salted beef cheeks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Best of all is a plate of ox cheeks, given the salt beef treatment. This is a truly spectacular plateful. Cheeks do a lot of work so they can be tough old blighters. Unlike salt beef from brisket, which tumbles away into strands, this is tender to the fork but maintains its own internal tension. The pieces of cheek are topped with gossamer slices of bone marrow, rings of morel and podded green beans, like spring has dropped its nubile buds all over your plate. There is a scoop of finely acidulated and diced onions and green herbs to cut through the heftiness of the meat. But the killer detail is the limpid pool of a perfectly clarified oxtail consomm\u00e9 in which all this sits; it\u2019s the very essence of moo.</p> <p>If this liquid, lip-smackingly rich in gelatine, dropped below room temperature you just know it would form a jelly, as any good beef consomm\u00e9 should. Oh how I would love to get all those hucksters and charlatans currently flogging bone broth as if it was a thing (it\u2019s called stock) to line up, sip some of this, and then realise they are wasting everybody\u2019s time and money. Then they could head off to do something more socially useful, like robbing banks. It barely needs saying, but to make a dish like this you need the kind of formal training that only Tanaka\u2019s eight restaurant-long career so far could gift him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e7010a9a47eeeaff314cbf75ec764914dc5c5bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e7010a9a47eeeaff314cbf75ec764914dc5c5bf/1555_880_3509_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"For the tarte tatin eight caramelised apples encircle one in the centre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A beautiful thing\u2019: the caramelised tarte tatin for two.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not everything thrills. From that lunch menu a dense, brassica nettle \u201crisotto\u201d, shoved in inverted commas because it\u2019s made with pearly grains of fregola, is slippery and heavy rather than comforting. You can tell it\u2019s good for you, without appreciating it being so. An overly heavy hand with the herbs in a rosemary ice cream makes it taste like a chemically scented candle smells. It\u2019s distracting. But the tarte tatin for two that it accompanies is a beautiful thing, all chewy caramelised pastry, and apples that quiver and fall apart when nudged with a spoon. Ask for it with their vanilla instead.</p> <p>The Ninth is not a unique restaurant in London right now. I can think of a number of places \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/29/piquet-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\">Piquet</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/20/blanchette-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\">Blanchette</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/aug/30/terroirs-wine-bar-restaurant-london\">Terroirs</a>, for starters \u2013 delivering great food at a reasonable price in relaxed surroundings. But there is a precision and, at times, an understated brilliance to this restaurant which does set it apart. Let\u2019s put it this way: I don\u2019t think Tanaka need move on to his 10th establishment any day soon.</p> <h2>Jay\u2019s news bites</h2> <p>\u25a0 Generally, numbers slip into restaurants\u2019 names courtesy of the address. Hence: 40 Maltby Street, in a railway arch south of London\u2019s Tower Bridge. This is a wine business, with a food operation attached. But for a secondary trade the robust cooking is far better than it ever need be. The changing menu throws up the likes of skate wing alongside salsify fritters or black pudding with salt cod and rabbit (<a href=\"http://40maltbystreet.com\">40maltbystreet.com</a>).</p> <p>\u25a0 An intriguing pop-up called Thornback comes to Leeds from 12-15 May, led by Brett Barnes, formerly of the city\u2019s Reliance pub. He will cook a six-course British seafood menu with Ronnie Murray, group head chef for Mark Hix. Tickets are available from <a href=\"http://leedsindiefood.co.uk/\">leedsindiefood.co.uk</a>.</p> <p>\u25a0 Harrogate restaurant Norse has introduced airline style \u201cdynamic\u201d pricing to take on the city\u2019s chains. On Mondays prices will be discounted by 25% , with the discount dropping 5% each day until Friday. Owner Paul Rawlinson said he\u2019d consider the impact of the trial at the end of May (<a href=\"http://norserestaurant.co.uk\">norserestaurant.co.uk</a>).</p> <p><em>Email Jay at </em><a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\"><em>jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</em></a><em> or f</em><em>ollow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrayner1?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@jayrayner1</a></em></p>",

Almost without fail, page after page is dedicated to the cultivation of spinach, while a few chapters later similar space is dedicated to the eradication of dandelions. As a botanist I can\u2019t help but think: what if they were the other way round? What makes one plant a weed and another a prized edible worth so much time and effort? Despite being cast as a horticultural villain, dandelions are actually one of the oldest crops, with fresh, tender leaves. They are a popular salad green, from France and Italy to China and India. With good reason, too, as the vegetal bitterness is virtually identical to the flavour of other leafy crops, like chicory (to which it is related). Nutritionally it doesn\u2019t fare badly either, having twice the vitamin A of spinach per serving (more than your daily dose in each handful) and more than double the vitamin C, not to mention a huge helping of more than five times your recommended daily intake of vitamin K. Spinach is not only a runner-up in the vitamin stakes, it also is comparatively bland, without any of the dandelion\u2019s gutsy radicchio-meets-rocket flavour. Anyone who has tried it will also tell you that spinach is not the easiest crop to grow, with its tendency to bolt into flower at the slightest hint of being kept too dry or too hot. Dandelions, by contrast, literally plant themselves. They are also super high-yielding, and generate big bunches of pretty yellow flowers that are great for pollinators at the time of year when they need them most. I grow mine by simply lifting dandelions that pop up on their own in my beds and borders (you don\u2019t have to be to gentle about this) and planting them spaced about 30cm apart in a bed of rich soil. If they are in shadier spots, with a weekly douse of water, the leaves will grow far larger and lusher and have a milder flavour. Some growers will even cover plants in large buckets or terracotta pots for a few weeks in the early spring. In this dark environment the new growth will emerge primrose-yellow and elongated. This process, known as blanching, makes for milder, more tender leaves \u2013 exactly as is done for conventional chicory. I love to eat them just as you would any salad green, or briefly saut\u00e9ed in garlic, lemon and olive oil. They make an amazing salad tossed in the hot fat from crispy fried lardons along with a handful of croutons and a tablespoon of chopped chives. For years the idea of eating dandelions has come with associations of eccentricity, but strip the prejudices aside and all you are left with is a healthy, delicious chicory that requires next to no work to grow.

The big picture: Skateistan Skate School, Kabul Action sports such as skateboarding and surfing can speak to the young like nothing else. Professor Holly Thorpe, of the University of Waikato in New Zealand, has published research into the potential for these activities to help international development. There are now 150 Sports for Development and Peace-related organisations around the world. The skateistan.org skate-school project is one. The project photographed here by Hamdullah Hamdard is in Kabul. A new skate school is also being built in Johannesburg. Well dressed: Mafia bags Professional kite surfer Marcos Mafia and his sister Paz, an industrial engineer, began taking sails from Marcos\u2019s old kitesurfs and turning them into bags in 2012. Since 2014 they\u2019ve been producing them in California and incorporating ex-windsurfs and boat sails with kitesurfs, recycling more than 750 sails a year. Their range of everything from messenger bags, duffels and totes to full rucksacks hugely popular in the US and Japan, and lately in the UK. No two bags are the same \u2013 they\u2019re from upcycled sailcloths, after all \u2013 but all are handmade in California to resist wind and water exposure and perform in extreme weather conditions. They come with a lifetime guarantee \u2013 and, of course, they\u2019re infused with the spirit of extreme adventure from their past life. Mafia Bags are available online or at their concession in Topshop.

      "bodyText": "The seat of Maribyrnong in Melbourne\u2019s western suburbs is safely held by the federal opposition leader, Bill Shorten, has long been Labor\u2019s, and has been held by men for 110 years. But on Saturday night more than 100 people gathered for the campaign launch of the Greens\u2019 candidate for Maribyrnong, Dr Olivia Ball, who told supporters that she was confident the Greens could gain a significant portion of the Labor vote in the coming election and claim the seat within a couple more. She plans to do so on the basis that many Melbournians, who have held regular and well-attended protests against the federal government\u2019s asylum seeker policy in recent months, are unable, she says, to see a strong point of difference between the Coalition and Labor\u2019s border protection policies. The latest protest on Saturday saw 500 people gather in the city, angered by the death of Omid, the 23-year-old Iranian refugee who died after setting himself alight in protest on Nauru. Ball obtained her PhD at the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law and is co-founder of Remedy Australia, which focuses on human rights violations as determined by the UN and advocates for proven violations to be remedied. After years of providing counselling and therapy for refugee survivors of torture, Ball has turned her attention to politics, saying the issue of asylum seekers was too urgent for her not to. \u201cCertainly asylum seeker policy is only one area of my work but we are highlighting it as a key weakness for the Labor party and I think it is the thing that upsets Labor supporters the most,\u201d Ball tells Guardian Australia. \u201cThere are people in this room tonight who have written to Shorten and said they can\u2019t bring themselves to support his party any more over the asylum seeker issue. We would like the Labor party to wake up to the enlightened, progressive constituency that don\u2019t see asylum seekers as threats and wants to welcome them to Australia.\u201d On Thursday, Fairfax reported that a damaging split had emerged in federal Labor over asylum seeker policy, with four MPs \u2013 Melissa Parke, Lisa Singh, Jill Hall and Sue Lines \u2013 breaking ranks and calling for the 900 asylum seekers on Manus Island to be settled in Australia. Sema Top, a longtime Labor voter who was at Ball\u2019s launch, says she is 95% sure she will vote Greens for the first time this election. \u201cBecause of their policy towards asylum seekers,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s not much difference between Labor and Liberal at the moment.\u201d Her 22-year-old daughter, Eylul, who is a law student and Greens party member, agrees. \u201cA lot of Labor\u2019s policy on asylum seekers is the same the Coalition\u2019s; they just have a different way of putting it forward,\u201d she says. \u201cOver the last couple of years I think people have really started to understand the issues around asylum seekers and refugees and I think this year might be the year the Greens get significantly more support in Maribyrnong.\u201d The Greens hold the best chance of claiming more seats in the lower house in the increasingly gentrifying, northern suburbs electorates of Wills and Batman. But elections are about more than just winning. The Greens believe Maribyrnong, though unlikely to fall away from Labor any time soon, provides them with an opportunity to monopolise on discontent towards Labor and play the medium-term game. In the 2010 federal election, the Greens\u2019 Adam Bandt claimed victory in the seat of Melbourne after taking a 10.6% swing in what was then Australia\u2019s only Labor/Greens marginal seat. By the 2013 election, Bandt had clawed even more ground from Labor\u2019s Cath Bowtell, with his 43.7% of the primary vote an 8% improvement on his total in 2010. His win in the seat that had been held by Labor for more than 100 years was the result of a strong grassroots campaign that saw the party gradually gain disillusioned Labor voters over the years. They polled 19.0% in 2004, 22.8% in 2007 which saw them finish second after preferences, before the eventual 2010 victory. It\u2019s a situation Bandt tells the room at Ball\u2019s campaign launch he expects to see repeated in Maribyrnong within a couple of elections\u2019 time. Not only has the seat always been held by Labor \u2013 it has never been held by a woman. \u201cOne hundred and ten years of uninterrupted men is quite enough,\u201d Ball says. \u201cI am prepared to interrupt them.\u201d The Greens\u2019 policy on asylum seekers, Ball says, is to close offshore detention centres completely and use the savings from closing them to increase Australia\u2019s intake of people seeking asylum, which would increase from 13,700 to 50,000, including 10,000 under a new skilled refugee category. In a first for him, the high-profile human rights barrister Julian Burnside, who taken on asylum seeker cases pro-bono, is at Ball\u2019s launch to endorse her candidacy. He says he has long respected the tradition of the bar not to disclose alignment or biases towards or against political parties. \u201cSo to be speaking tonight is unusual for me and I had to think long and hard whether to do it, and if so why,\u201d he said. \u201cOur political system is, in my opinion, in really bad shape. Both major parties are a disgrace. I don\u2019t know if Olivia has a chance of winning this seat or not but what\u2019s important is the primary vote of both major parties falls. Because they will notice that.\u201d He later told Guardian Australia that while he was still not a member of any political party, nor encouraging people to specifically vote for the Greens, his view is that \u201cthe point of having a vote this year is that you can not vote for either of the major parties\u201d. \u201cAustralians think we are being protected from criminals through the current asylum seeker policy and that is probably the most dishonest piece of political rhetoric I\u2019ve ever experienced in my lifetime,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is interesting that Labor, to their eternal discredit, have never stood up to this lie. They wring their hands and go along with it.\u201d Asked by Guardian Australia for the key points of difference between Labor\u2019s asylum seeker and border protection policy and the Coalition\u2019s, Shorten replied that Labor policy was driven by a determination to stop people drowning at sea. \u201cBy 2025, Labor will increase Australia\u2019s annual humanitarian intake to 27,000 \u2013 almost double the current intake,\u201d he said. \u201cA Labor government will also provide significantly increased annual funding to the UNHCR for its global work program and its work in south-east Asia and the Pacific. Labor in government will take a leadership role to build a regional humanitarian framework to improve the situation of asylum seekers and Labor will reinstate references to the UN refugees convention in the Migration Act.\u201d Labor would also increase independent oversight of offshore processing facilities, he said, and ensure that those working in the immigration system held whistleblower protections to allow them speak out about maladministration and corruption. The Green\u2019s border protection and asylum policy, he says, would \u201csee men, women and children drown at sea\u201d. Ball responded by saying the \u201cso-called drownings argument is a way of turning a blind eye to the suffering and deaths that occur out of sight\u201d. The Greens\u2019 refugee policy included measurers to discourage dangerous sea voyages, she said, including increasing Australia\u2019s funding to the UNHCR and similar organisations to quickly process refugee applications to intermediary countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, and would also allow asylum seekers to seek work and education while they waiting for their applications to be assessed. \u201cIf they can live a decent life with the right to work and education, people will be far less likely to engage in a very risky journey across the seas,\u201d Ball said. \u201cNobody wants to see people drowning at sea but it\u2019s a nonsense when you see the suffering we cause through current bipartisan refugee policies, which are totally illegal under international law and which are morally repugnant, to say people aren\u2019t being harmed in other ways. \u201cIf Mr Shorten and Labor is genuinely concerned about the safety and welfare of those seeking asylum, he wouldn\u2019t support their arbitrary detention.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Only in America. Never in Britain. The irresistible rise of Donald Trump has horrified our political class and at the same time has made them feel terribly smug. His incendiary journey towards the presidential nomination of one of his country\u2019s major parties has been accompanied by many expressions of disgust on this side of the Atlantic. In unison, our mainstream politicians have condemned the racist language he unleashes against Mexicans and Muslims. What a gift he has been. What a pleasurable opportunity he has offered British politicians wanting to posture from high moral ground. Some MPs have backed motions demanding that the probable Republican nominee be banned from our shores. Others have insisted that he should be allowed here so he can be told to his face that he is horrible. The subtext of all this condemnation is a conviction that a Trump could never happen here. The political class feel a similar surge of self-satisfaction when they look across the Channel at the rise of extremists on the continent. We\u2019ve no fascist party here, they tell themselves with a comforting pat on the back. The BNP imploded long ago. So there\u2019s Nigel Farage and he can be an outlet for unsavoury remarks with a racial charge, but batty old Nigel, he\u2019s not exactly the real deal is he? He\u2019s not Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilder, Norbert Hofer or Golden Dawn. Let\u2019s congratulate ourselves for fashioning such a maturely sophisticated country that it has no tolerance for racial politics. It is time to grab a sharp pin and burst that bubble of smugness. After recent events, in which one of Labour\u2019s most famous figures opined that Hitler wasn\u2019t always insane about Jews, and senior Tories have gone down and dirty by playing the race card in the London election, who can say that British politics is immunised to this poison? The way both our major parties have been conducting themselves tells a different and much less comfortable story. That self-satisfied look on the face of British politics needs to be wiped off. The convulsion about antisemitism within the Labour party has been a long time brewing. Some in the party\u2019s senior ranks even call it \u201ca cancer\u201d. That is hyperbolic because it implies that the party is so riddled with a voracious disease that it is being devoured by it. The vast majority of Labour members are not antisemitic, but there is a serious problem with a nasty strand of the hard left who are. This pre-dated Jeremy Corbyn, but it seems to have got worse and has certainly become more visible since he took over the Labour leadership. Many Labour MPs report that the surge in membership last summer and since has brought with it characters with extremely repellent views that should have no place in a party dedicated to opposing racism in all its forms. Part of the explanation for Labour\u2019s failure to tackle this as swiftly and robustly as it ought to have done is that its compliance procedures have been overwhelmed. One member of the shadow cabinet laments: \u201cYou can\u2019t check every tweet anyone has ever made before you accept a membership application.\u201d True enough. It would be obviously wise, though, for Labour to be much more thorough about invigilating the back catalogue of the opinions of people who seek to stand for public office in the party\u2019s name. The time to find out that Naz Shah was of the view that Israelis should be put on \u201ctransportation\u201d to America, with all the chilling echoes that has for Jews, was before she was selected as a Labour candidate, not after she became a Labour MP. The initial foot-dragging about suspending her as an MP suggested a blind spot about antisemitism in Mr Corbyn and some of his inner circle. So has the repeated suggestion from his camp that this is not a real issue, but a confected crisis manufactured by people trying to destabilise his leadership. It took until Friday for him finally to deliver the unqualified condemnation that many of his MPs had been looking for. He said: \u201cI am totally and completely and absolutely against antisemitism.\u201d Mr Corbyn had to triple down on the condemnatory adverbs because his previous statements had left too much room for doubt in too many minds that he took the issue seriously enough. He has now announced an inquiry into how Labour polices its frontiers. This he was previously hesitant to do and for an obvious reason: putting adequate resources and robust rules in place will mean kicking out people who are his supporters. This brings us to Ken Livingstone. There is no crisis in the Labour party, as Alan Johnson wittily put it, that an intervention by Ken Livingstone cannot make worse. The former mayor of London defended Ms Shah when she had already stopped defending herself and started to apologise for being \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201coffensive\u201d. Then, in the incorrigibly incendiary way which has been his career trait, he brought Hitler into it with the extraordinary claim that the Nazi dictator was \u201csupporting Zionism\u201d in 1932 \u201cbefore he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews\u201d. I am not sure that this makes him a \u201cdisgusting Nazi apologist\u201d, as John Mann had it when the Labour MP confronted Mr Livingstone before the TV cameras. I am persuaded that this makes the former mayor of London a flippant, insensitive, crass, muddled idiot. Something has gone very awry with the inner wiring of a politician when he prays in aid what Hitler might have thought to judge any contemporary political controversy, and his neural pathways must be blown to introduce Hitler as a witness for the defence against a charge of antisemitism. Most bewildering of all was his suggestion that Hitler was sane until 1932 and only lost the plot thereafter. So in the Livingstone life of the f\u00fchrer, the Hitler who wrote Mein Kampf was perfectly all right. His unrepentant performance on radio yesterday morning guarantees that this storm will rage on. One way for Labour to assess the damage done by the last week is to take a look at the pain and shock on the faces of its friends. Isaac Herzog, the leader of the Israeli Labour party, yesterday wrote to Mr Corbyn, expressing himself \u201cappalled and outraged\u201d. Another way for Labour to calibrate the hurt done to itself is to look at the ecstatic smiles on the faces of its enemies. Nigel Farage is loving it. The Ukip leader smirkingly remarks that we are \u201cno longer the party accused of harbouring extremists\u201d and accuses Labour of nurturing \u201csectarianism\u201d. Mr Farage would know about that. His contributions to injecting a racial charge into our politics have included defending the use of the word \u201cChinky\u201d to describe someone with a Chinese name, suggesting that you wouldn\u2019t want a family of Romanians moving next door and blaming his lateness for an engagement on traffic jams caused by immigrants. Another person who has taken hypocritical relish in Labour\u2019s travails is Boris Johnson, who has delivered himself up of the opinion that there is \u201csome sort of virus of antisemitism in the Labour party\u201d. This would be the same Boris Johnson who recently dismissed Barack Obama\u2019s right to hold an opinion on British membership of the European Union on the grounds that the US president is \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d. As silly a remark as someone saying that Mr Johnson is unfit to hold an opinion on the EU because he is part-Turkish. Labour evidently has a serious problem, but the last place to go for sincere advice about tackling racism is the Conservative party. In the contest for London mayor, the Tories have given up trying to beat Sadiq Khan on housing, transport and the environment, the issues that matter to Londoners. They have resorted to tactics that are called \u201cculture wars\u201d if you are being overpolite and actually amount, if you are being accurate, to playing the race card. My colleague Sonia Sodha recently set this out, and did so in forensic detail. The Tories are trying to defeat Mr Khan, a liberal Muslim who has made energetic efforts to connect with Londoners of all faiths and none, by trying to drive manufactured racial wedges into the London electorate. Yvette Cooper wasn\u2019t far wrong when she observed that the insidious message of the Tory campaign against Mr Khan has been: \u201cDon\u2019t vote for him, he\u2019s a Muslim\u201d. One of the greatest disservices Ken Livingstone did to his party and its chances of winning the city of which he was once mayor was to make it harder for Labour to call out the Tories on their toxic tactics. The Tories will now retort: sort out your party before you accuse us of racism. David Cameron knows he\u2019s not a racist, which is presumably how he convinces himself that it can\u2019t be racist when his party plays the race card in London. Jeremy Corbyn knows he\u2019s not a racist, which is presumably why the Labour leader has struggled to see that his party contains racists. Look again gentlemen. At yourselves. At your parties. Make it a hard look. This is how it starts. With weak or desperate or myopic politicians who refuse to see racism for what it is in all its guises, who pander to prejudice and who indulge bigotry. Donald Trump is what happens next.",

His incendiary journey towards the presidential nomination of one of his country\u2019s major parties has been accompanied by many expressions of disgust on this side of the Atlantic.</p> <p>In unison, our mainstream politicians have condemned the racist language he unleashes against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\">Mexicans</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/dec/08/donald-trump-calls-for-complete-ban-on-muslims-entering-the-us-video\">Muslims</a>. What a gift he has been. What a pleasurable opportunity he has offered British politicians wanting to posture from high moral ground. Some MPs have backed motions demanding that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/18/donald-trump-should-be-banned-from-uk-for-inflaming-hate-mp-says\">probable Republican nominee be banned</a> from our shores. Others have insisted that he should be allowed here so he can be told to his face that he is horrible.</p> <p>The subtext of all this condemnation is a conviction that a Trump could never happen here. The political class feel a similar surge of self-satisfaction when they look across the Channel at the rise of extremists on the continent. We\u2019ve no fascist party here, they tell themselves with a comforting pat on the back. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/14/general-election-2010-fall-bnp\">BNP imploded</a> long ago.

Let\u2019s congratulate ourselves for fashioning such a maturely sophisticated country that it has no tolerance for racial politics.</p> <p>It is time to grab a sharp pin and burst that bubble of smugness. After recent events, in which one of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/28/ken-livingstone-suspended-from-labour-after-hitler-remarks\">Labour\u2019s most famous figures</a> opined that Hitler wasn\u2019t always insane about Jews, and senior Tories have gone down and dirty by playing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/25/sadiq-khan-tories-donald-trump-approach-london-zac-goldsmith\">race card in the London election,</a> who can say that British politics is immunised to this poison?</p> <p>The way both our major parties have been conducting themselves tells a different and much less comfortable story. That self-satisfied look on the face of British politics needs to be wiped off. The convulsion about antisemitism within the Labour party has been a long time brewing. Some in the party\u2019s senior ranks even call it \u201ca cancer\u201d. That is hyperbolic because it implies that the party is so riddled with a voracious disease that it is being devoured by it. The vast majority of Labour members are not antisemitic, but there is a serious problem with a nasty strand of the hard left who are. This pre-dated Jeremy Corbyn, but it seems to have got worse and has certainly become more visible since he took over the Labour leadership.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/01/diane-abbott-smear-labour-antisemitism-problem-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4tn59\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2496969\"            data-video-name=\"Diane Abbott: 'Smear' to say Labour has anti-semitism problem \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC One\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5725e710e4b0a2f120514bca\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/01/160501AbbottMarrAntiSemitism_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/01/160501AbbottMarrAntiSemitism_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/01/160501AbbottMarrAntiSemitism.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/01/160501AbbottMarrAntiSemitism_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/01/160501AbbottMarrAntiSemitism_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/01/diane-abbott-smear-labour-antisemitism-problem-video\">Diane Abbott: \u2018Smear\u2019 to say Labour has anti-semitism problem \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Many Labour MPs report that the surge in membership last summer and since has brought with it characters with extremely repellent views that should have no place in a party dedicated to opposing racism in all its forms. Part of the explanation for Labour\u2019s failure to tackle this as swiftly and robustly as it ought to have done is that its compliance procedures have been overwhelmed. One member of the shadow cabinet laments: \u201cYou can\u2019t check every tweet anyone has ever made before you accept a membership application.\u201d True enough. It would be obviously wise, though, for Labour to be much more thorough about invigilating the back catalogue of the opinions of people who seek to stand for public office in the party\u2019s name.</p> <p>The time to find out that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/27/naz-shah-suspended-labour-party-antisemitism-row\">Naz Shah</a> was of the view that Israelis should be put on \u201ctransportation\u201d to America, with all the chilling echoes that has for Jews, was before she was selected as a Labour candidate, not after she became a Labour MP. The<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/27/naz-shah-timeline-of-events-leading-to-mps-suspension-from-labour\"> initial foot-dragging</a> about suspending her as an MP suggested a blind spot about antisemitism in Mr Corbyn and some of his inner circle. So has the repeated suggestion from his camp that this is not a real issue, but a confected crisis manufactured by people trying to destabilise his leadership. It took until Friday for him finally to deliver the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/29/jeremy-corbyn-interview-ken-livingstone-it-is-not-a-happy-day\">unqualified condemnation </a>that many of his MPs had been looking for. He said: \u201cI am totally and completely and absolutely against antisemitism.\u201d</p> <p>Mr Corbyn had to triple down on the condemnatory adverbs because his previous statements had left too much room for doubt in too many minds that he took the issue seriously enough. He has now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/29/jeremy-corbyn-sets-up-inquiry-into-labour-antisemitism-claims\">announced an inquiry </a>into how Labour polices its frontiers. This he was previously hesitant to do and for an obvious reason: putting adequate resources and robust rules in place will mean kicking out people who are his supporters.</p> <p>This brings us to Ken Livingstone.

      "bodyText": "Tuesday\u2019s federal budget will include funding for a $15m for a national carp control plan in an attempt to eradicate Australia\u2019s worst freshwater feral pest, the government announced on Sunday. The plan includes the staged release of the carp-specific herpes virus in the Murray-Darling basin. CSIRO scientists have been testing the virus in Australian native fish species and other animals found along the river for the past seven years and have established that it is safe to release into the ecosystem without harming other species. The virus affects the carp\u2019s skin and kidneys, takes about seven days to have a noticeable effect and, once it takes hold, usually kills the fish within 24 hours. A joint ministerial taskforce will finalise the national plan and includes the minister for industry, innovation and science, Christopher Pyne, the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, and the minister for the environment, Greg Hunt. \u201cThe common carp is a nasty pest in our waterways and makes up 80% of fish biomass in the Murray Darling Basin,\u201d Pyne said. \u201cAnyone who loves the Murray knows what damage the carp have caused to the river environment over many years. The Invasive Animals Cooperative Research Centre and the CSIRO have made significant progress evaluating a viral biological control agent, we know that it works, we know it\u2019s completely safe, now we need to plan the best way to roll it out.\u201d Joyce said the economic impact of carp was estimated at $500m a year, mostly in regional Australia, and especially along the Murray River. Current control measures, including trapping, commercial fishing and exclusion, were expensive and largely ineffective at controlling carp over large areas or for any length of time, he said. Carp also threaten others species by making water turbid, causing erosion and out-competing native fish for food and resources. The Australian Conservation Foundation described the funding and staged release of the virus as \u201ca good first step\u201d. The foundation\u2019s healthy ecosystems program manager, Jonathan La Nauze, said the funding would enable the community consultation and planning required to ensure the virus was released safely and without unwanted impacts on river communities. But releasing the virus alone would be a wasted opportunity if it was not supported by other native fish recovery measures that were underfunded, he said. \u201cThe legacy of past mismanagement in the Murray-Darling is that 21 out of the 23 major river valleys are in poor or very poor health, according to the Sustainable Rivers Audit,\u201d La Nauze said. \u201cCarp thrive in this kind of degraded environment \u2013 in fact they make it worse by turning over the river bed, eroding the banks and literally muddying the water. \u201cControlling carp must go hand-in-hand with rehabilitating riverbanks, making irrigation infrastructure fish-friendly and, of course, the release of environmental flows.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "When it finally came, it took less than 27 minutes. So simple, so powerful, so emphatic \u2013 and so obviously right. So why on earth did it take 27 years to arrive? I am not the only one who needs to ask this question. Every MP, every journalist \u2013 indeed the whole country \u2013 needs to keep on asking it too. That\u2019s because until there is a broadly shared consensus on how the breathtaking injustice of Hillsborough happened, we will not be able to make this the moment of change for our country that it needs to be. The simple truth about 15 April 1989 and its aftermath has been sitting quietly in official files for all those years. If the state had wanted the families to have it earlier, it only had to say the word. But it didn\u2019t. Parts of it still don\u2019t. And that says something very worrying about how we are governed and policed. As I have walked my own journey over Hillsborough, from the 19-year-old at the other semi-final, and then onwards to MP and Government minister, I have seen life from both sides of the fence. What I have seen along the way has given me a much deeper understanding of why so many people are so disillusioned with Westminster politics. And this may sound surprising coming from a politician \u2013 I share their disillusionment. I know better than anyone how close people came to never knowing the full truth about one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in British history. Far from exposing the cover-up, the committees room of parliament and the offices of Number 10 were used to advance it. I remember all too well the pressure I came under to leave this issue alone. During my 15 years in parliament, I have become very familiar with a Westminster elite that is sometimes too enmeshed with the elites in other professions \u2013 law, media, business \u2013 to be in a position to advance the cause of ordinary people. Consequently, we still live in a country where those elites hold the cards and your social class and accent still have far too great a bearing on how you are treated. One of the most revealing moments on my journey came in the summer of 2012. With the help of Mark Durkan MP, I arranged a meeting for representatives of the Hillsborough families with those who had lost loved ones on Bloody Sunday. I went with Margaret Aspinall and Jenni Hicks to the heart of working-class Derry, so similar to Liverpool in so many ways, and we sat among those wonderful, down-to-earth Derry families. To sit and listen to this historic meeting between the two groups, to see the common ground they immediately shared, was a rare privilege and a humbling moment. And it gave me a moment of clarity in understanding the nature of injustice and why it often stands for so long. The Derry families said that, for the first 20 years after Bloody Sunday, their campaign hadn\u2019t got anywhere. So raw were the feelings, and so slow the progress, the families began to fall out with one another. It was only when the 20th anniversary of Bloody Sunday came around, and a new generation had come to the fore, that they decided to put their differences behind them and fight as one for truth and justice. The parallel with Hillsborough, and that 20th anniversary moment, could not have been stronger. The system plays the long game. It can afford to. It works on the basis that people will be ground down by the frustration and the wait. It plays the propaganda war against working-class communities, encouraging the rest of the country to think the worst of them. But this is where the establishment came unstuck. Rather than the worst of our country, they are the best. They understand the power of true solidarity. As well as wrongly maligning the people of Derry and Liverpool, the establishment made the fatal mistake of underestimating them. Their story should give hope to anyone, anywhere fighting against injustice. But there are a lot of them and they do not have the reach of the Hillsborough campaign. Many are not getting anywhere. Consequently, the establishment has beaten them or is on the verge of doing so. That frustrates me intensely because it denies the people of this country some uncomfortable truths that it needs to know. For instance, how many know that, a few years before Hillsborough, the miners at Orgreave were subject to the same underhand tactics from the same police force that were subsequently used to much more deadly effect against the Liverpool fans? Not many is my guess. The truth about policing of the miners\u2019 strike is still well hidden. I live in a former mining village in the Lancashire coalfield. When I was out campaigning last year, I knocked on the door of someone who lives a few streets away from me. He said he had something to show me. He went back inside his house and brought out an official-looking badge with the words \u201cmilitary police\u201d on it: \u201cI ripped this off a uniform when they attacked us in the street right&nbsp;there.\u201d Like Derry and Liverpool, mining communities were on the receiving end of a propaganda war to deny their cause any public sympathy. But knowing what we know about Hillsborough, every single person in the land should be loudly demanding the truth about Orgreave. But the injustices that still stand to this day don\u2019t just hit trade unionists or working-class communities. They cross all social classes and walks of life. I think, also, of the farmers I have worked with who have suffered terrible physical and mental damage from exposure to organo-phosphates during sheep dipping and who have faced a wall of obfuscation from an agriculture department that doesn\u2019t want to tell them what it knew at the time. I think of the victims of the contaminated blood scandal, too, who come from all parts of the country and who continue to get nothing more than scraps off the table to keep them quiet. My hope is that Hillsborough might provide a moment of amnesty on state injustice. The success of this one campaign needs to have a domino effect on others. It must also mark a shift in the balance of power from the state to the ordinary citizen, starting with more accountability in our police force. We must have an end to the scandalous situation where senior officers can use retirement as a means of escaping accountability for misconduct and remain on a full pension for the rest of their lives. The legal system also needs radical change and re-balanced in favour of victims. Its adversarial nature suits the authorities. It can easily intimidate people who are pitched into an intimidating court environment. And the authorities spend public money like water in hiring the best lawyers. By contrast, the victims of any disaster have to scratch around to get whatever legal representation they can. That can\u2019t be right and must change. And we need a much better press regulatory system. After the phone-hacking revelations, the possibility of real change opened up. But since then, the political and media elite has closed ranks again. Ordinary people have no real ability to undo the damage of a misleading and mendacious front-page story. But there are positives about Hillsborough that we can cling to. At least this country was able finally to open up and look itself in the mirror. And in an increasingly atomised world, it provides a reminder of what true solidarity can achieve. This tells us that&nbsp;change is possible. So just as a new&nbsp;generation of campaigners had to come to the fore, now the new generation in parliament must make Hillsborough a moment when Britain changed for the better.",

      "bodyText": "Liverpool has been a good place to be these past few days. That April in 1989, it felt like something physical had changed in the city \u2013 as though someone had turned up the gravity. Everything felt heavier. Over the years, you got used to it, like the howling of a distant siren. Now, at last, we tread with a lighter tread. The police, the press and the politicians tried to make it about Liverpool. Those who miraculously survived that day came home to find that not only had they lost friends and family, they were now somehow implicated in their deaths. People such as Trevor Hicks, who lost two daughters and who described himself to me as \u201ca Thatcherite businessman until then\u201d. On the way to the match, one of his girls complained to him about the rudeness of the police. He said: \u201cIf there\u2019s any trouble, they\u2019ll be the first people you turn to.\u201d It was one of the last conversations they ever had. The police adopted a strategy of victim-blaming. Liverpool and football fans were the perfect victims. The story found a ready audience and their lies had traction long after they were exposed. When Steve Rotheram, MP for Liverpool Walton, made his celebrated speech in October 2011, he was allowed to use the word \u201clies\u201d \u2013 against normal parliamentary procedure \u2013 because in all the vast riches of English no other word would do. But only a year earlier, Jeremy Hunt, when he was \u2013 of all things \u2013 secretary of state for culture, media and sport had reiterated the whole \u201cfans were to blame\u201d libel. Now the matter is settled. Hillsborough was not about Liverpool. Hillsborough is not about the past. Yes, it was a long time ago and back in the day police corruption was commonplace, while health and safety was unheard of. But the 27 years that have passed are themselves a matter of scandal. To use the passage of time as a reason not to prosecute those responsible is ludicrous. The fact that this has taken so long is an extra charge to be laid at their door. But we would be compounding a great wrong if we allowed clowns such as Kelvin MacKenzie and Hillsborough police chief, David Duckenfield, to carry all the blame. Hillsborough, in ways that are not immediately obvious, has reshaped us. Like privatisation or the Iraq war, it changed everything. Murdoch was able to use what happened at Hillsborough not only to gain control of the Premier League but also to sidestep press regulations and monopoly commissions. The grotesque disconnect between fans and the clubs they love opened up here. More importantly, the ghoulish cabal that created the notorious \u201cthe truth\u201d headline \u2013 MacKenzie, some police officers and the late Tory MP Irvine Patnick \u2013 is the direct antecedent of the poisonous chumocracy whose mechanisms were briefly exposed during the hacking scandal. The fact that Murdoch is uncomfortably aware of how much he gained from Hillsborough and its cover-up was clear last Wednesday when his papers were the only ones that didn\u2019t lead on the verdict. The demonisation of working people did not begin at Hillsborough. But Hillsborough turbo-charged it. The transformation of the working class from salt of the earth to scum of the earth \u2013 from Coronation Street to Benefits Street \u2013 was the battering ram that cleared the way for benefit cuts and austerity. When Boris Johnson, in 2004, or Jeremy Hunt, in 2010, made their Hillsborough \u201cgaffes\u201d, they were not slips of the tongue. They were moments when the door was left ajar and we overheard how they talked about us when they thought we weren\u2019t listening. Or worse, they were a calculated manoeuvre \u2013 freshen up the libel, then wash your hands of it. Does that sound like a conspiracy theory? One of the most shocking things about the report of the independent panel was the revelation of just how vast and how calculated the conspiracy was. Even the families were taken aback. Hillsborough was not about Liverpool. But the cover-up, the indifference of the rest of the nation, the fact that Kelvin MacKenzie still has some sort of career as a kind of poor man\u2019s Katie Hopkins, have all fed into the city\u2019s consciousness. Children who were born years afterwards are painfully aware of the events of that April day. They are part of the city\u2019s identity in the way that Bloody Sunday is part of Derry\u2019s. What happened last week gives us the opportunity to take the toxins of paranoia and victimhood out of that inheritance. After the 7/7 bombings in London the press was, rightly, full of stories of the extraordinary heroism of ordinary commuters. There were acts of such heroism on 15/04 too, but we never had the chance to celebrate them because they were hidden behind the smokescreen. Now we have the chance to celebrate a different heroism \u2013 that of the families. The establishment tried to impose a narrative on Hillsborough. The families refused to accept it. Hillsborough is about the power of dignity in the face of humiliation, about the persistence of love in the face of loss, and the power that love has to change things. It\u2019s important to note the crucial role that women played in this story. It\u2019s also important to note that some of its heroes \u2013 Andy Burnham, Steve Rotheram, Bishop James Jones, to name just a few \u2013 belong to those very establishment institutions we so often vilify. The high points of the campaign were those memorial services at Anfield where faith groups, fans and politicians came together in a kind of new settlement when the wider political establishment was being discredited. At a time of social fragmentation and isolation they were expressions of a profound and purposeful sense of community .It was at one of these that Andy Burnham had his epiphany. Hillsborough is not about Liverpool. It\u2019s about all of us. The victory of the families tells us that we \u2013 all of us \u2013 deserve better and that we are capable of creating something better. At the last memorial service, the former Everton striker Graeme Sharp read Psalm 23. One way to translate that would be \u201cthough we walk in the valley of death, we do not walk alone\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Liverpool has been a good place to be these past few days. That April in 1989, it felt like something physical had changed in the city \u2013 as though someone had turned up the gravity. Everything felt heavier. Over the years, you got used to it, like the howling of a distant siren. Now, at last, we tread with a lighter tread. The police, the press and the politicians tried to make it about Liverpool. Those who miraculously survived that day came home to find that not only had they lost friends and family, they were now somehow implicated in their deaths. People such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/16/hillsborough-inquests-trevor-hicks-two-daughters-died-evidence\" title=\"\">Trevor Hicks</a>, who lost two daughters and who described himself to me as \u201ca Thatcherite businessman until then\u201d. On the way to the match, one of his girls complained to him about the rudeness of the police. He said: \u201cIf there\u2019s any trouble, they\u2019ll be the first people you turn to.\u201d</p> <p>It was one of the last conversations they ever had. The police adopted a strategy of victim-blaming. Liverpool and football fans were the perfect victims. The story found a ready audience and their lies had traction long after they were exposed. When Steve Rotheram, MP for Liverpool Walton, made his celebrated speech in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2011/oct/14/hillsborough-disaster-steve-rotheram-commons-debate\" title=\"\">October 2011,</a> he was allowed to use the word \u201clies\u201d \u2013 against normal parliamentary procedure \u2013 because in all the vast riches of English no other word would do. But only a year earlier, <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/fury-sports-secretary-jeremy-hunt-3405374\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt</a>, when he was \u2013 of all things \u2013 secretary of state for culture, media and sport had reiterated the whole \u201cfans were to blame\u201d libel. Now the matter is settled. Hillsborough was not about Liverpool.</p> <p>Hillsborough is not about the past. Yes, it was a long time ago and back in the day police corruption was commonplace, while health and safety was unheard of. But the 27 years that have passed are themselves a matter of scandal. To use the passage of time as a reason not to prosecute those responsible is ludicrous. The fact that this has taken so long is an extra charge to be laid at their door. But we would be compounding a great wrong if we allowed clowns such as Kelvin MacKenzie and Hillsborough police chief, David Duckenfield, to carry all the blame. Hillsborough, in ways that are not immediately obvious, has reshaped us. Like privatisation or the Iraq war, it changed everything. Murdoch was able to use what happened at Hillsborough not only to gain control of the Premier League but also to sidestep press regulations and monopoly commissions.</p> <p>The grotesque disconnect between fans and the clubs they love opened up here. More importantly, the ghoulish cabal that created the notorious \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/26/how-the-suns-truth-about-hillsborough-unravelled\" title=\"\">the truth\u201d headline</a> \u2013 MacKenzie, some police officers and the late Tory MP Irvine Patnick \u2013 is the direct antecedent of the poisonous chumocracy whose mechanisms were briefly exposed during the hacking scandal. The fact that Murdoch is uncomfortably aware of how much he gained from Hillsborough and its cover-up was clear last Wednesday when his papers were the only ones that didn\u2019t lead on the verdict. The demonisation of working people did not begin at Hillsborough. But Hillsborough turbo-charged it. The transformation of the working class from salt of the earth to scum of the earth \u2013 from <em>Coronation Street</em> to <em>Benefits Street</em> \u2013 was the battering ram that cleared the way for benefit cuts and austerity. When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/13/boris-johnson-apologises-hillsborough-article\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson, in 2004</a>, or Jeremy Hunt, in 2010, made their Hillsborough \u201cgaffes\u201d, they were not slips of the tongue. They were moments when the door was left ajar and we overheard how they talked about us when they thought we weren\u2019t listening.</p> <p>Or worse, they were a calculated manoeuvre \u2013 freshen up the libel, then wash your hands of it. Does that sound like a conspiracy theory? One of the most shocking things about the report of the independent panel was the revelation of just how vast and how calculated the conspiracy was. Even the families were taken aback.</p> <p>Hillsborough was not about Liverpool. But the cover-up, the indifference of the rest of the nation, the fact that Kelvin MacKenzie still has some sort of career as a kind of poor man\u2019s Katie Hopkins, have all fed into the city\u2019s consciousness. Children who were born years afterwards are painfully aware of the events of that April day. They are part of the city\u2019s identity in the way that Bloody Sunday is part of Derry\u2019s.</p> <p>What happened last week gives us the opportunity to take the toxins of paranoia and victimhood out of that inheritance. After the 7/7 bombings in London the press was, rightly, full of stories of the extraordinary heroism of ordinary commuters. There were acts of such heroism on 15/04 too, but we never had the chance to celebrate them because they were hidden behind the smokescreen.</p> <p>Now we have the chance to celebrate a different heroism \u2013 that of the families. The establishment tried to impose a narrative on Hillsborough. The families refused to accept it. Hillsborough is about the power of dignity in the face of humiliation, about the persistence of love in the face of loss, and the power that love has to change things. It\u2019s important to note the crucial role that women played in this story. It\u2019s also important to note that some of its heroes \u2013 Andy Burnham, Steve Rotheram, Bishop James Jones, to name just a few \u2013 belong to those very establishment institutions we so often vilify.</p> <p>The high points of the campaign were those memorial services at Anfield where faith groups, fans and politicians came together in a kind of new settlement when the wider political establishment was being discredited. At a time of social fragmentation and isolation they were expressions of a profound and purposeful sense of community .It was at one of these that <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/hillsborough-andy-burnham-mp-major-3334516\" title=\"\">Andy Burnham had his epiphany</a>.</p> <p>Hillsborough is not about Liverpool. It\u2019s about all of us. The victory of the families tells us that we \u2013 all of us \u2013 deserve better and that we are capable of creating something better. At the last memorial service, the former Everton striker Graeme Sharp read Psalm 23. One way to translate that would be \u201cthough we walk in the valley of death, we do not walk alone\u201d.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And with that, the final White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner of the Obama administration came to an end with, if not raucous cheers, not exactly the hostile reception past comedians have received. You can\u2019t say that Larry Wilmore killed: his humor \u2013 as it normally is \u2013 was a bit more of the wait-did-he-really-say-that variety, which is definitely not in keeping with the typical WHCD crowd ... which tends to think that he perhaps ought not to have said it. And, Wilmore\u2019s jibes at CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer and Don Lemon, MSNBC\u2019s morning show juggernaut Morning Joe and the death of print journalism (all topics well-covered at the event in past years, but normally by the president) were pretty unpopular with the likely inebriated crowd, earning him a couple of loud boos from folks who probably ought to have known better. Laughing at himself is a skill the president managed to perfect at these things over the years; it\u2019s one that not all the journalists in attendance seem to have mastered (though Don Lemon pasted a smile on and waved at the crowd). At least his reception wasn\u2019t so poor that, like the year after Colbert made fun of George W Bush, the association will be tempted to find the most banal, grandparent-friendly comedian possible. And next year will bring a new president: the question now is whether that president will be able to laugh at him or herself, and how much material with which she or he will give the host to work. Wilmore ends by noting that, in his lifetime, we\u2019ve gone from a country that couldn\u2019t accept a black quarterback on a footbalk team to one that elected a black president. \u201cSo Mr President, I\u2019m going to keep it 100. Yo, Barry, you did it my n*****.\u201d On one of Obama\u2019s biggest failed promises. \u201cI just got a note from the president saying that if you want another drink, you should order it now because the bar will be closing down. Of course, he said the same thing about Guantanamo, so you have at least another eight years.\u201d Returning to Obama: \u201cI don\u2019t know when we\u2019re getting a black president again. I mean, they\u2019re not even going to let Morgan Freeman be president in movies for a while.\u201d On Ted Cruz: \u201cMan, everybody hates Ted Cruz. Even OJ Simpson said, \u2018Man, that guy\u2019s just hard to like\u2019.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a joke going around the internet that Ted Cruz is actually the Zodiac Killer. That\u2019s absurd: some people actually liked the Zodiac Killer.\u201d \u201cJohn Boehner came out of retirement and described Ted Cruz as \u2018Lucifer in the flesh.\u2019 Lucifer! I mean, that is not fair. Lucifer is horrible, but he\u2019s not the Zodiac killer.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t even think Ted Cruz wants to be president. I just think he\u2019s criss-crossing the country Zodiac-killing.\u201d More on Trump: \u201cMorning Joe has their head so far up Trump\u2019s ass, they bumped into Chris Christie.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump looks like the rich dad in every single episode of Law and Order where the frat kid accidentally strangles the hooker, doesn\u2019t he. Or, as they say here at the Washington Hilton, \u2018Tuesdays\u2019.\u201d On Donald Trump: \u201cDonald Trump says he\u2019s going to try to be more presidential, it\u2019s true. He\u2019s serious about it, too. So he says that now when he boasts about his genitalia during a debate, he\u2019s only going to refer to it as his President Johnson. LBJ? Oh, very good.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t understand why everyone treats Donald Trump with kid gloves. And then I realized they\u2019re the only gloves that will fit his stupid little baby hands.\u201d On Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders: \u201cBernies\u2019s been hanging around with rapper Killer Mike, or as Hillary Clinton calls him \u2018Super Predator Mike\u2019.\u201d \u201cHillary Clinton was flustered when a Black Lives Matter protestor challenged her. I haven\u2019t seen a white lady that upset over being blind-sided by a black person since Kelly Ripa.\u201d On Bernie Sanders: \u201cHe recently had a hernia operation. His doctors say it\u2019s his own fault, for trying to lift the hopes of the disenfranchised. You gotta stretch before you do that, Senator.\u201d On Ben Carson: \u201cHe praised [Andrew] Jackson, saying he was a tremendous president. From the grave, Andrew Jackson replied \u2018What did that jigaboo say?\u2019\u201d On Chris Christie: \u201cHe RSVP\u2019d for three: him, his wife and Donald Trump\u2019s dry-cleaning. Chris lost a lot of weight recently, didn\u2019t he. He said he just eliminated everything from his routine that wasn\u2019t necessary, like his self-pride and dignity.\u201d After a few more anti-CNN jokes (one of which earned him boos \u201cI used to watch it back when it was a news network\u201d), it was Fox\u2019s turn: \u201cAnd not to throw any shade, but Fox News is the highest-rated cable news channel among viewers who have no idea what shade means.\u201d And after joking about Fox\u2019s wall-to-wall anti-Beyonc\u00e9 coverage post Superbowl: \u201cI think Fox secretly likes Beyonc\u00e9, though. They just renamed The Kelly File \u2018Becky With The Good Hair\u201d. On MSNBC: \u201cWhich actually now stands for Missing a Significant Number of Black Correspondents.\u201d \u201cMSNBC got rid of so many black people, I thought Boko Haram was running that network.\u201d On broadcast media: \u201cC-Span is carrying tonight\u2019s dinner live, which is ironic, because most of their viewers aren\u2019t. It\u2019s true, guys. C-Span is the number one network among people who died watching TV and no one\u2019s found them yet.\u201d He also cracks a Jeb Bush suicide watch joke, to groans. On being in the company of the elite: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to match the names to the faces in the Panama Papers.\u201d On the death of print media: \u201cA couple of years ago during this dinner,you were killing Osama bin Laden, remember that? Who are you killing tonight? Can\u2019t be print journalism, that industry\u2019s been dead for a while. Sorry! I\u2019m just kidding. Shout out to the print media. No, really, you have to shout, they\u2019re like all over 70 now.\u201d Silence in the ballroom. On the president\u2019s visible aging while in office: \u201cYour hair is so white it tried to punch me at a Trump rally. The president\u2019s hair is so white it keeps trying to say \u2018All Lives Matter.\u2019 No, man, you came in here looking like Denzel, now you\u2019re going out looking like Grady from Sanford and Sons. I know it\u2019s a dated reference, but you\u2019re dated Mr President! All I\u2019m saying is that, in less than eight years Mr President, you\u2019ve busted two time-honored stereotypes. Black does crack. And apparently once you go black, it looks like we are going back. Thanks, Ben Carson.\u201d Wilmore compliments Michelle Obama: \u201cShe\u2019s the epitome of grace, class and poise. Not to be confused with future First Gentleman Bill Clinton, whose three favorite strippers are named Grace, Class and Poise.\u201d He goes after Wolf Blitzer: \u201cSpeaking of drones, how is Wolf Blitzer still on television\u201d\u201d he asked, to a few drunken jeers. \u201cAsk a follow-up question! Hey Wolf, I\u2019m reader to project tonight\u2019s winner: anyone that isn\u2019t watching The Situation Room.\u201d Wolf, and the audience, remained stone-faced. Wilmore compares Obama to Golden State Warriors star player Steph Curry: \u201cBoth of you like raining down bombs on people from long distances.\u201d Wilmore suggests that next year the dinner will be called \u201cDonald Trump presents a luxurious evening paid for by Mexico\u201d and thanks \u201cMitch McConnell for not blocking my nomination. You gotta give Mitch McConnell credit: at this point, he could block LeBron James.\u201d \u201cWelcome to Negro night here at the Washington Hilton\u201d he begins. \u201cOr as Fox news will report, \u2018Two thugs disrupt elegant dinner in DC.\u201d And a response from Patrick Gavin: I wrote a while back that the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association should use its biggest spotlight \u2013 this dinner \u2013 to shine a light on the struggles it faces. White House Correspondents\u2019 Association President Carol Lee did an admirable job pointing out the Associations\u2019 mission, but I wish she would have done more: Talking about the Obama administration\u2019s persecution of whistleblowers and the difficulty of FOIA requests, to name a few. Her remarks on journalists under threat around the world was excellent. It says something that President Obama spent greater time talking about the current state of media than the Association itself. It says something about how perceptions of this dinner have changed during the Obama years that Obama now routinely mocks the dinner itself, noting that it\u2019s \u201ctacky\u201d and a \u201cunique event.\u201d He routinely notes how he might rather not be there. I suspect this might be an ongoing trend. Best jokes: His \u201cCPT\u201d diss on Hillary/de Blasio Noting that he\u2019s so hold, he\u2019ll be meeting his death panel soon. Ouch, that Jake Tapper burn. Ouch, that Hillary-Facebook burn. (I counted *five* Hillary jokes) Ouch, that \u201cAnd I\u2019m supposed to be the foreign one\u201d diss on Ted Cruz. \u201cThe last time I was this high...\u201d It\u2019s great to see a president casually poking fun at himself over smoking cigarettes and marijuana. Also: as we all might have guessed, Merrick Garland jokes are destined to ... bomb. And then he did the inevitable serious bit, and signed out for the rest of his life. Then he shows a video about what he\u2019s going to do with the two years they\u2019ve promised to stay in DC to allow their daughter to finish high school. It featured cameos from Joe Biden and John Boehner, the inevitable birth certificate joke and the second one about mom jeans of the evening, plus one each about LinkedIn and old people trying to use Snapchat. It was titled \u201cCouch Commander\u201d. You aren\u2019t sorry that you missed it. But here it is: And more on Trump: \u201cThere\u2019s one area where Donald\u2019s experience could be invaluable, and that\u2019s closing Guantanamo, because Trump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground. Alright, that\u2019s probably enough, I\u2019ve got more material. I don\u2019t want to spend too much time on The Donald. Following your lead, I want to show some restraint, because I think we can all agree that, from the start, he\u2019s gotten the appropriate amount of coverage befitting the seriousness of his candidacy. I hope y\u2019all are proud of yourselves. The guy wanted to give his hotel business a boost and now we\u2019re all praying that Cleveland makes it through July.\u201d He initially fakes out the audience by pretending to segue into the serious journalism-celebrating part, but rounds back on Trump: \u201cAlthough I am a little hurt that he\u2019s not here tonight. We had so much fun the last time. And it is surprising: you\u2019ve got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras and he says no. Is this dinner too tacky for The Donald? What could he possible be doing instead? Is he at home eating a Trump steak tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel? What\u2019s he doing?\u201d On Ted Cruz calling a basketball hoop \u201ca basketball ring\u201d in Indiana: \u201cWhat else is in his lexicon? Baseball sticks? Football hats? But, sure, I\u2019m the foreign one.\u201d On John Kasich: \u201cMeanwhile, some candidates aren\u2019t polling high enough to qualify for their own joke tonight. The rules were well established ahead of time.\u201d On the Republican race: \u201cThings are a little more... how should we say this, a little more loose? Just look at the invitations to tonight\u2019s dinner. Guests were asked to check whether they wanted steak or fish, but instead a whole bunch of you wrote in Paul Ryan. That\u2019s not an option people. Steak or fish. You may not like steak or fish, but that\u2019s your choice.\u201d He then compares \u201cFeel the Bern\u201d as a slogan to Hillary Clinton\u2019s: \u201cTrudge up the Hill.\u201d He added: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to admit it, Hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little like your relative who just signed up for Facebook. \u2018Dear America, did you get my poke? Is it appearing on your wall? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m using this right. Love, Aunt Hillary.\u2019 It\u2019s not entirely persuasive.\u201d He adds: \u201cI am hurt, though, Bernie, that you\u2019ve been distancing yourself a little from me. I mean, that\u2019s just not something that you do to your comrade.\u201d Acknowledging Bernie Sanders, \u201cthe bright new face of the Democratic party\u201d, Obama says: \u201cBernie, you look like a million bucks. Or to put it in terms you\u2019ll understand, you look like 37,000 donations of $27 each.\u201d To former NYC mayor Mike Bloomberg, whom he initially compared to the other NYC billionaire leading the race for the Republican nomination. \u201cIt\u2019s not an entirely fair comparison between you and The Donald. After all, Mike was a big city mayor, he knows policy in-depth and he\u2019s actually worth the amount of money that he says he is. Obama \u201ccongratulates\u201d Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus on earning a night off after the successful and uncontroversial conclusion of the Republican primary process. He also called out Helen Mirren. \u201cHelen Mirren is here tonight. I don\u2019t even have a joke here, I just think Helen Mirren is awesome.\u201d And now for the annual jokes about the decline of the journalism industry: \u201cI also would like to acknowledge some of the award-winning reporters that we have with us here tonight: Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schrieber. Thank you all for everything that you\u2019ve done. I\u2019m just joking, as you know Spotlight is a film, a movie about investigative journalist with the resources and the autonomy to chase down the truth and hold the powerful accountable. Best fantasy film since Star Wars.\u201d He added: \u201cEvery year at this dinner, somebody makes a joke about Buzzfeed, for example, changing the media landscape. And every year the Washington Post laughs a little bit less hard.\u201d The laughter was pretty uncomfortable. It\u2019s time for the annual Joe Biden joke: \u201cI love Joe Biden, I really do. I want to thank him for his friendship, for his counsel, for always giving it to me straight, for not shooting anybody in the face.\u201d Speaking of his increasing popularity in his final year in office, he says \u201cThe last time I was this high, I was trying to decide on my major\u201d, to a few loud shrieks of laughter. \u201cEven my aides can\u2019t explain the rising poll numbers\u201d he adds. \u201cWhat has changed? No one can figure it out.\u201d And then he showed pictures of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. In a reference to Michelle Obama\u2019s infamous lack of enthusiasm for being in Washington, he said: \u201cYou might have heard that someone jumped the White House fence last week, but I have to give the Secret Service credit, they found Michelle, brought her back, she\u2019s sitting back at home now. It\u2019s only nine more months, baby.\u201d Obama takes a swipe at the press, noting that Savannah Guthrie and Norah O\u2019Donnell left the White Hous e... and \u201cJake Tapper left journalism to join CNN\u201d. Howls are heard in the audience; Tapper is seem taking a sip of wine. Obama says \u201cEven some foreign leaders have been looking ahead, anticipating my departure. Last week, Prince George showed up to our meeting in his bathrobe. That was a slap in the face. A clear breach of protocol.\u201d Obama cracks a \u201cred wedding\u201d joke, after suggesting that they consider Merrick Garland\u2019s US supreme court nomination in the hall. After a series of jokes about how he ages and Michelle Obama always looks the same, Obama\u2019s joke about being unpopular with Republicans falls flat. \u201cIn just six short months, I will be officially a lame duck, which means Congress now will flat-out reject my authority and Republican leaders won\u2019t take my phone calls. And this is going to take some getting used it, it\u2019s a curve ball, I don\u2019t know what to do with it.\u201d He pauses, waiting for laughter; the audience was waiting for the punch line. Enlarged prostate jokes always kill with the heavily male White House press corps: \u201cHillary once questioned whether I\u2019d be ready for a 3am phone call. Now I\u2019m awake anway because I\u2019ve got to go to the bathroom. I\u2019m up.\u201d Obama makes a joke about being \u201cgray and grizzled, just counting down the days to my death panel.\u201d (It\u2019s not his first death panel joke of the last eight years.) He adds: \u201cIf this material works well, I\u2019m going to use it at Goldman Sachs next year, earn me some serious Tubmans\u201d, references to Clinton\u2019s now-controversial well-remunerated speeches to the financial services firm and the recent decision to put the founder of the Underground Railroad on US currency. Obama apologizes for being late, and says \u201cI was running on CPT, which stands for \u2018Jokes That White People Should Not Make\u2019\u201d \u2013 a reference to a recent, poorly-thought-through skit by NYC mayor Bill Di Blasio and Hillary Clinton in which she \u201ccastigated\u201d him for endorsing her so late, and he claimed to have been \u201crunning on CP time.\u201d (\u201cCP time\u201d means \u201ccolored-people time\u201d, a racist reference to the supposed habitual tardiness of people of color.) The majority-white crowd screamed with laughter. It\u2019s his last White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner speech, and he took the stage to the strains of \u201cYou\u2019re going to miss me when I\u2019m gone.\u201d White House Correspondents\u2019 Association president Carol Lee introduced a video of the presidents\u2019 most memorable press conferences, touching on the passage of Obamacare, the killing of Osama bin Laden, immigration reform, the thawing of relations with Cuban and the Iran deal. It also catalogued some of the times he slipped, hit his head, repeated the phrase \u201cbe clear\u201d, tripped up his words, failed to correctly identify the reporter to which he was speaking and wore \u201cmom jeans.\u201d The White House Correspondents\u2019 Association is now handing out its journalism awards, and freed Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian is doing the honors. A full list of those awards can be found here. Read Rezaiain\u2019s post-freedom interview here: Michelle Obama is on stage to present the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association scholarships to the student winners. A complete list of the young people getting hugs from the First Lady can be found here. The Sunlight Foundation decided to troll the press corps in attendance at the TIME-People pre-party on Friday night (sponsored by Toyota, presumably among others.) The non-profit organization \u2013 which, among other things, maintains a free, easy-to-use database of all political donations \u2013 asked departing attendees to donate their ginormous canvas bags of free stuff to the charity, with little success. Watch video of their efforts \u2013 including the demand by one reporter \u201cDon\u2019t make us look bad by going to a party\u201d \u2013 below. Last year\u2019s swag bags were worth an estimated $550, including the LeSportsac bag in which they came. Like Donald Trump himself, Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs is not at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner, but not because he can\u2019t take a joke. Jacobs has a scoop on the New Hampshire Republican party\u2019s apparent efforts to undermine the New Hampshire Republican primary winner, one Donald J Trump. In an email obtained by the Guardian, the state\u2019s Republican leadership proposed a slate where the delegate chair and every committee slot would be filled by supporters of other candidates. In other words, while Trump\u2019s convention delegates from New Hampshire are safe and sound, New Hampshire Republicans are trying to make sure that everyone else\u2019s supporters will fill the committee slots \u2013 especially those slots on the rules committee, which may well determine how the convention functions and whether, in a contested convention scenario, Trump really takes home his prize. Read more: And if watching the nation\u2019s political and celebrity elite finally get served their petit filets au poivre isn\u2019t quite thrilling enough, read more about Father Daniel Berrigan, who died today at the age of 94. Berrigan was a prominent Catholic anti-war and social justice activist who helped shaped the face of American opposition to the Vietnam War. And as C-Span cuts away from Wolf Blitzer chewing and toasting with Reince Priebus \u2013 they were drinking the Franciscan Estate chardonnay, according to C-Span, which got a not-bad review from Cheap Wine Ratings, though decide for yourself whether that\u2019s a good thing or not \u2013 Patrick Gavin weighs in on what jokes he\u2019s waiting for from the president and host Larry Wilmore. Things I\u2019ll be looking for: Are jokes about Politico not funny/edgy anymore? (Politico\u2019s break-every-news-story-down-on-the-basis-of-how-if-affects-the-next-election coverage was a source of constant humor in previous years, though they were also among the most DC-insidery.) Hastert jokes. Anyone dare? (Former Republican Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert was sentenced this to 15 months in prison this week for financial crimes related to molesting teenagers during his pre-Congressional years as a high school wrestling coach. Hastert admitted in court that he had \u201cmistreated\u201d some of the teenagers he coached.) Trump jokes: Sure, they\u2019ll be funny but they\u2019re also the low hanging fruit \u2013 easy and expected. Maybe we\u2019ll see less than we think. (Or maybe not.) Any chance Wilmore brings up last year\u2019s embarrassment? (During last year\u2019s event, protests in nearby Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray in police custody took a more serious turn even as jokes about racialized violence were told on the stage.) Obama Nicorette re-loads. My guess is on a baker\u2019s dozen. (The president infamously quit smoking before getting into the 2008 presidential race, and it was once a Washington blogger/gossip game to try to catch him smoking again.) I\u2019m excited to be joined by journalist and documentary filmmaker Patrick Gavin, who is an expert on what the dinner was, is and could be. Hi! Excited to hop on board. I covered this dinner/weekend for 10 years at such places as Politico, Washington Examiner and FishbowlDC. I probably held the distinction of turning in some the dumbest coverage of anyone. (Sorry!) After a bit of a catharsis, I took a more critical look in 2015 with my first documentary, Nerd Prom: Inside Washington\u2019s Wildest Week, and, ever since, I\u2019ve become like the least popular in town all weekend thanks to some of my critical coverage. Anyway! So what should you know going into this thing? Here are the things about this event that depress me: The amount they give away in scholarships is pretty paltry. The Association itself doesn\u2019t always practice what they preach. The cause of White House correspondents? It actually is super important and worthy of your attention. You could be forgiven for wondering the obvious: Why is the biggest event in a town with low approval ratings for everyone (reporters, politicians alike) a big self-celebration? Yeah, you\u2019re telling me. Okay, let\u2019s drink! Read Patrick\u2019s OpEd for The Guardian today: After this, they\u2019ll sit down and eat a fancy dinner prepared and served for 2,700 people and served by hourly wage employees. Catering staff at the Washington Hilton, where the event is held, are by and large people of color represented by United Here! Local 25. In other catering news, Trump\u2019s SoHo property in New York has been accused by a former catering staffer of stiffing its catering staff on tips in violation of New York law. The catering, though, is handled by a subcontractor. If you\u2019re watching the live feed above, and getting bored watching a bunch of people you don\u2019t know get slowly drunk and schmooze with other people you don\u2019t know, interspersed with their efforts to talk to celebrities without seeming like utter fan-boys and -girls, might I recommend checking out some quality journalism from The Guardian? The first American has died of complications the Zika virus. Law enforcement in Lebanon broke up a sex trafficking ring that had enslaved dozens of female Syrian refugees who had gone there to escape the war in their home country. And if you\u2019re wondering why people call it \u201cnerd prom\u201d, they cribbed it from now-MTV news correspondent (and former Guardian columnist) Ana Marie Cox, who wasn\u2019t being exactly kind when she coined it. Now, it\u2019s used as a humble-brag, like \u201cOh, ho, aren\u2019t I nerdy, here\u2019s my selfie with Will Smith\u201d; then, it was a way of mocking the annual desperation to get included on the guest list. Cox reportedly regrets having coined the term. Here is Will Smith taking a selfie of himself with the photographers taking pictures of him. If you\u2019re curious about how the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner went from being a self-congratulatory scholarship-awarding dinner to a self-congratulatory, celebrity-spotting spectacle, some more information on that can be found here. Carrie Fisher, attending the dinner as a guest of The Guardian, created the biggest red carpet stir by bringing her dog, Gary. As you may have heard, dogs don\u2019t really like to be hugged by their owners, according to \u201cscience\u201d but, since this is America and, in the current political climate, only uncontroversial science is accepted as fact (as demonstrated by climate denialism), it\u2019s unclear how much of a difference any scientific findings will make to dog-owners. The red carpet is wrapping up as the stragglers head into the dinner, but we\u2019ll continue to find something to cover (I hear there are other things happening in the world?) as the 2,700 guests tuck into their diver scallops, steak, shrimp, dessert and \u2013 according to C-Span \u2013 Napa Valley wines. Meanwhile, here are The Guardian\u2019s guests, Tom Hiddleston, Carrie Fisher and Gary the dog, posing on the red carpet. (C-Span assures us that Gary was very popular on Twitter.) Just now on C-Span, People editor JD Heyman on celebrities and their causes. And I think it\u2019s a natural impulse on the part of very wealthy people and powerful people to want to be engaged in that way [with a cause]. So I think it\u2019s both for public image reasons and financial management reasons and just human reasons that people become involved in either political or environmental or other work related to causes. I know that most Americans may raise an eyebrow about the causes of some celebrities, but many of them feel the causes quite profoundly and do want to engage and feel like, you know, noblesse does not come without oblige and they should do something with their celebrity and their resources. Here is a picture of Kendall Jenner, of the Kardashian Jenners, arriving at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner, which is dedicated to the important role the fourth estate plays in holding the executive branch of the US government to account. The dinner is, as you can imagine, not without its critics. New York City-based photographer Clayton Cubitt, a Bernie Sanders supporter, is among them. You can see some of hits Vets4Bernie portraits here: So is Tressie McMillan Cottom, an assistant professor of sociology at Virginia Commonwealth University. (Her essay on Prince after his death is a must-read.) And here\u2019s a picture of prominent Sanders supporter and Clinton critic, Rosario Dawson. Eric Trump, Donald Trump\u2019s middle son, says that he\u2019s prepared to hear jokes about his dad. The Donald is boycotting because of how dishonest the media is, and not because he got made fun of a lot last year and has a thin skin. Read more about how he got zinged by the sitting president last year. C-Span reports that the dinner tonight will consist of \u201cPetite filet au poivre paired with honey and orange infused shrimp, dunk confit, souffle potato, asparugus, zucchini, carrot and roasted peppers.\u201d Americans in 2016, by the way, waste 50% more food than they did in the 1970s. Anyway, here\u2019s Lady Mary from Downton Abbey. Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders is also a guest of the media tonight. And, if you\u2019re a long-time Trump watcher, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise to see Omarosa Manigault, who told The Hollywood Reporter at a pre-party that she\u2019s \u201ca Trumplican\u201d. She added: This is a reality TV generation, right? They\u2019re used to characters on TV saying whatever, doing whatever. Doing crazy things. Changing the game. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. We did that on The Apprentice in 2003. We\u2019re doing that with the presidency in 2016. She currently appears on the trail as a Trump surrogate. Trump has not revealed if he plans to nominate her to a position within his administration. Aretha Franklin is in the house. If you didn\u2019t see her perform at this year\u2019s Kennedy Center Honors, why not take a moment and check it out. Emma Watson, who helped launched the women\u2019s equality effort #HeForShe is also in attendance and looking pretty cool. If you\u2019re interested in her work on women\u2019s issues, perhaps you should read this piece about how rape survivors at the Mormon Brigham Young University are fighting back against honor code violations when they report their sexual assaults. Apparently, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is a Scandal fan. Helen Mirren is, like all of us, a Prince fan \u2013 but she wears it more than on her sleeve. Bill Nye is hanging out with Steve Aoki: There\u2019s also Tony Goldwyn (the president on Scandal) with Shonda Rhimes. And Guardian US writer Steven W Thrasher is hanging out with Carrie Fisher and her dog, Gary. Currently on C-Span, two men are discussing the propensity for some women to wear something other than high heels under their gowns at the White House Correspondents Dinner C-Span host: Is it becoming more and more common for women to wear comfortable shoes rather than... JD Heyman, deputy editor for entertainment at People: I actually don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever... Women like to wear high heels for this event, but they will often try to tuck a pair, if they\u2019re coming with a team of people, there may be a pair of more comfortable shoes in a bag. People tough it out, pretty much. There is a bunch of science about how terrible high heels are for your health. The red carpet has begun: on C-SPAN, all you can hear is photographers shouting at the top of their lungs, as celebrities are led one-by-one in front of photographers. Jeff Goldblum is speaking to Extra, Emma Watson has been spotted and Assad has ended the ceasefire in Syria. If you are the kind of person who tunes into C-Span before even the red carpet starts, you were treated to a look-back at George W Bush\u2019s comedy stylings, which included jokes about Dick Cheney shooting people, Dick Cheney riding a segway, Dick Cheney being curious if the plot of Brokeback Mountain meant that the Lone Ranger and Tonto got it on, Bush singing off-key about how brown the grass is on his ranch and Bush conducting the Marine Corps Band playing John Phillips Sousa. Oh, here, look: protestors supporting of the Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr stormed the parliament building in Iraq, prompting the declaration of a state of emergency. Good evening, and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the \u201cnerd prom\u201d, the not-quite self-deprecating nickname for the annual White House Correspondents Dinner. This will be Barack Obama\u2019s final turn at telling jokes behind the podium \u2013 and the current election cycle has given him plenty of fodder for his routine, which generally consists of zingers at other politicians\u2019 expense, jibes at members of his administration and newsy references that would be cut from Saturday Night Live\u2019s Weekend Update for being not funny enough. He\u2019ll be followed by comedian and host Larry Wilmore, host of Comedy Central\u2019s The Nightly Show, a The Daily Show spin-off for the former TDS correspondent. Wilmore has a typically tough job: to be funny without being offensive to the assembled politicians and media types, many of whom have an inflated sense of self \u2013 a sense not reduced by being in the presence of bona fide celebrities. Guests this year include one of Obama\u2019s would-be successor, Bernie Sanders, as well as Aretha Franklin, Ilana Goldblum, Ilana Glazer, Will Smith and Rachel McAdams. Infamously, the last former TDS corespondent to host the dinner, Steven Colbert, bombed with the in-crowd, though he killed with viewers at home, in 2006 because he performed in character from The Colbert Report and didn\u2019t pull his punches about then president George W Bush, the wars he\u2019d started or his cozy relationship with the media. Wilmore isn\u2019t expected to be as pointed about the incumbent president, but one suspects he has more than enough material on the potential next president with which to work. But before that, join us for coverage of the red carpet, a little commentary from Patrick Gavin, director of the documentary Nerd Prom: The Movie and a look at what else is going on in the world that is probably more important than the sight of media types back-slapping with the politicians they\u2019ll supposedly go back to holding to account tomorrow. (And maybe some intel about Carrie Fisher\u2019s dog, which is supposedly going to be seated with the General herself at the Guardian\u2019s table.) CSpan is airing the whole event live on its site, and several cable news networks plan to cover it as well. At 6pm ET there will be a red carpet rolled out for stars of Hollywood, TV and music, political journalists of all stripes, and some of Washington\u2019s most powerful politicians. Around 7.30pm the action will quiet, as everyone turns to the plates in front of them. And it revs back up again at about 9.45pm, when the president and Wilmore take the stage.",

And, Wilmore\u2019s jibes at CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer and Don Lemon, MSNBC\u2019s morning show juggernaut Morning Joe and the death of print journalism (all topics well-covered at the event in past years, but normally by the president) were pretty unpopular with the likely inebriated crowd, earning him a couple of loud boos from folks who probably ought to have known better.</p> <p>Laughing at himself is a skill the president managed to perfect at these things over the years; it\u2019s one that not all the journalists in attendance seem to have mastered (though Don Lemon pasted a smile on and waved at the crowd).

Wilmore has a typically tough job: to be funny without being offensive to the assembled politicians and media types, many of whom have an inflated sense of self \u2013 a sense not reduced by being in the presence of bona fide celebrities. Guests this year include one of Obama\u2019s would-be successor, Bernie Sanders, as well as Aretha Franklin, Ilana Goldblum, Ilana Glazer, Will Smith and Rachel McAdams.</p> <p>Infamously, the last former TDS corespondent to host the dinner, Steven Colbert, bombed with the in-crowd, though he killed with viewers at home, in 2006 because he performed in character from The Colbert Report and didn\u2019t pull his punches about then president George W Bush, the wars he\u2019d started or his cozy relationship with the media.</p> <p>Wilmore isn\u2019t expected to be as pointed about the incumbent president, but one suspects he has more than enough material on the potential next president with which to work.</p> <p>But before that, join us for coverage of the red carpet, a little commentary from Patrick Gavin, director of the documentary Nerd Prom: The Movie and a look at what else is going on in the world that is probably more important than the sight of media types back-slapping with the politicians they\u2019ll supposedly go back to holding to account tomorrow. (And maybe some intel about Carrie Fisher\u2019s dog, which is supposedly going to be seated with the General herself at the Guardian\u2019s table.)</p> <p>CSpan is airing the whole event live on its site, and several cable news networks plan to cover it as well.</p> <ul> <li>At 6pm ET there will be a red carpet rolled out for stars of Hollywood, TV and music, political journalists of all stripes, and some of Washington\u2019s most powerful politicians.<br /></li> <li>Around 7.30pm the action will quiet, as everyone turns to the plates in front of them.</li> <li>And it revs back up again at about 9.45pm, when the president and Wilmore take the stage.</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-04-30T21:15:13.512Z\">at 10.15pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

Over the weekend, the government announced $1.2bn in extra spending for education, there were reports of tax cuts for people earning more than $80,000 and the treasurer said debt would peak within five to six years. Morrison was asked if he could say \u201chand on heart\u201d that the proximity to the federal election had nothing to do with the a raft of budget measures announced or leaked in the past week. \u201cThis budget is an economic plan,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cIt\u2019s an economic plan for jobs and growth and a stronger new economy, a more diversified economy. That\u2019s what Australia needs. \u201cThis is not a typical budget, I agree with you on that, it\u2019s not a typical budget because this economic plan is so essential to the country\u2019s future. That\u2019s what I have been focusing on.\u201d Morrison would not specifically confirm reports in the Weekend Australian that there will be \u201cmodest\u201d tax cuts for those earning more than $80,000 a year. \u201cIt is not the government\u2019s policy to increase the tax burden on the Australian economy above what is currently projected and we believe that is the right approach to be taking to support jobs and growth,\u201d Morrison said. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, confirmed the budget would address bracket creep. \u201cWe have been committed to doing as much as we can sensibly afford to ensure the average wage earner doesn\u2019t move into the ... second highest tax bracket,\u201d Cormann told Sky News. If tax cuts go ahead, high income earners (those with incomes over $180,000) will get a double bonus when the temporary deficit levy introduced in the 2014 budget cuts out in 2017. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, would not commit to supporting any tax cuts for people who earn more than $80,000 until they see the details of the package. \u201cWe will look at this on its merits,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cWe expect the government to pay for all its initiatives. \u201cWe know this government has added very significant spending, even since the last Myefo [mid-year economic and fiscal outlook], which is currently unfunded. We had the treasurer yesterday saying budget deficits don\u2019t matter anymore. The AAA credit rating is under significant pressure which we regard as a very important priority. We\u2019ll look at all these measures.\u201d The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said the government might be patting itself on the back for offering modest tax cuts, but Australians would not fall for that tactic. \u201cFor the last three years, every day, the Liberal government has been pick-pocketing voters and now at the very last minute they are offering a few dollars in hope that all will be forgiven,\u201d Shorten told reporters in Melbourne. Morrison said government debt would continue to increase while there was a budget deficit but said it would peak in the next five to six years. \u201cAs long as we have got a deficit, debt will obviously continue to increase and that is why we have to reduce the deficit and the deficit will fall over the budget and forward estimates in the statement,\u201d he told the Nine Network. Morrison again confirmed the government was looking at changing tax rates for superannuation contributions. Last year Labor announced it would put a 15% tax on super earnings worth more than $75,000 a year and tax super contributions for those with incomes of more than $250,000. After Malcolm Turnbull took over the leadership, Labor committed not to run a scare campaign against the government in return for a sensible debate on tax reform. But Morrison used his pre-budget announcements to attack Labor for \u201cthrowing money around and paying for that with higher taxes\u201d. \u201cWe will be ensuring we better target the concessions in superannuation, we have said that for some time,\u201d said Morrison. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any great secret about that. The detail of those things we will deal with on Tuesday night but it\u2019s important we get those incentives right because superannuation is so important for Australians and their future and need to make sure the concessions are well targeted.\u201d But the Turnbull government faces an uphill battle during the budget parliamentary sitting week. The Coalition is planning to introduced temporary supply bills to the house on Monday, which essentially provides temporary money supply to keep government running over the election period. Separately, the budget appropriations bills, which contain the budget spending, are introduced to the lower house with Morrison\u2019s budget speech on Tuesday night. The first chance those bills can be passed by the lower house or the senate is Wednesday. Also competing for time is any proposed tax cuts, which reportedly were to begin as early as 1 July, the day before the expected election. The Senate then rises on Wednesday night with budget estimates committees on Thursday and Friday, even though the opposition leader Bill Shorten\u2019s budget reply speech does not occur until Thursday night.",

      "bodyText": "Andre Berto came off the floor to defeat Victor Ortiz on Saturday in a welterweight fight between two former world champions and rematch of their 2011 bout. Berto, who went down in the second round, was able to fight back and knock out Ortiz in the fourth. With the victory, Berto propelled himself back into the category of contender with a probable shot forthcoming against world title-holder Danny Garcia, who is also in Al Haymon\u2019s Premier Boxing Champions stable. With the defeat, Ortiz, 29, will struggle to ever enter the elite level again. Berto and Ortiz have had strange journeys since their first meeting five years ago. Back then, they were two of the most important welterweights on the planet. Ortiz-Berto I, on 16 April 2011, was a Fight of the Year contender that saw each boxer floored twice. Ortiz won that bout in a unanimous decision, marring Berto\u2019s unbeaten record. But Ortiz entered Saturday\u2019s rematch having fought only five times since then, losing three. On 17 September 2012, he defended the title he won from Berto against Floyd Mayweather Jr. After Ortiz head-butted Mayweather in the fourth round out of frustration, he walked over to apologize, Mayweather baited him and knocked him out with a memorable sucker punch. After the Mayweather loss, Ortiz became a boxing non-factor, enduring hand and jaw surgeries and using his time away from the ring to appear on the television show Dancing with the Stars and appear in the movies Southpaw and The Expendables 3. He has a habit of blaming the boxing media for his self-inflicted career woes. Meanwhile, Berto only fought six times, losing three. In 2012, he had a chance to redeem his loss to Ortiz, but before the scheduled rematch tested positive for the steroid norandrosterone. Boxing is full of redemption tales \u2013 if money can be made from them \u2013 and eventually Berto was given a chance on the big stage when Mayweather, who has always claimed to be boxing\u2019s voice against PED use, hand-picked him for his farewell fight. Last September, Mayweather dominated Berto in a forgettable, one-sided bout. Those long and winding roads reconverged on Saturday with Ortiz-Berto II, a bout not for a title but for relevancy. The fight really picked up in the second round as both men came out fast, each landing effective power punches. Ortiz, a southpaw, landed a straight left that put Berto down. He quickly stood up, visibly upset at himself. Later he would say he wasn\u2019t hurt by the punch. By round four, Berto had shaken off the knockdown and was doing an excellent job of cutting off the ring. He put Ortiz down for the first time with a quick combination. Ortiz rose with wobbly legs and Berto went on the attack connecting with a series of power punches. Ortiz could no longer defend himself and went down again, crashing into the ropes. \u201cOnce he went down it was over, I knew he was hurt and I went right after him,\u201d said Berto (31-4, 24 KOs). \u201cHe couldn\u2019t take my power.\u201d While Ortiz was able to rise before the end of the count, referee Jack Reiss asked him if he could continue. Looking glassy-eyed, Ortiz stared at Reiss as if he was listening to someone speak an unfamiliar language. When he didn\u2019t respond Reiss correctly stopped the fight. \u201cI dropped my hand and he caught me,\u201d recalled Ortiz (31-6-2, 24 KOs), who said he planned on going on vacation. In the first three rounds, Ortiz claimed he had done \u201ceverything right\u201d, and the judges agreed \u2013 he was winning on all three scorecards. Knockouts were definitely a theme on Saturday\u2019s PBC card. In the two most significant undercard fights, Mexican Jorge Lara (28-0-2, 20 KOs) dumped former three-division world champion Fernando Montiel (54-6-2, 39 KOs) to the canvas four times in the first round in a featherweight walkover. Montiel, 37, didn\u2019t look like he could avoid any power punches from his fast-rising opponent, who is 12 years his junior, and said afterward he would consider retiring. In the co-feature, light heavyweight Edwin Rodriguez (29-2, 20 KOs) faced Thomas Williams Jr (19-2, 13 KOs). As the second round was winding down Williams delivered a quick right and put Rodriguez on the canvas. He made it to his feet but the referee waved it off with one second left in the round. Williams will probably get a shot at 175lb world champion Adonis Stevenson later in the year. As the crowd of 7,760 wandered out of the StubHub Center, the main buzz centered around the futures of Berto and Ortiz. No longer the upper-echelon prizefighters they were the time of their first fight, what\u2019s next for both is uncertain. Ortiz talked about how crowds love to see him fight, and suggested, with a tinge of hope, Ortiz-Berto III. Berto, flush with victory and redemption, had his mind on Danny Garcia. For his part Garcia sounded non-committal during a brief cameo at the post-fight press conference. \u201cIf it\u2019s Berto, it\u2019s Berto,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "New Hampshire\u2019s Republican establishment is trying to limit the influence of Donald Trump supporters at the party\u2019s crucial national convention in July despite the presidential frontrunner having won the state\u2019s primary overwhelmingly. In an email obtained by the Guardian, the state\u2019s Republican leadership proposed a slate where the delegate chair and every committee slot would be filled by supporters of other candidates. Trump won overwhelmingly in the Granite State\u2019s February primary with 35% of the vote. His nearest competitor, John Kasich, only received 15% of the vote in the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation primary. Under New Hampshire\u2019s relatively proportional rules, where any candidate who gets over 10% of the vote receives delegates, Trump was awarded 11 of the state\u2019s 23 delegates. But the email sent by state party executive director Ross Berry on Saturday evening appears to be an attempt to deny the real estate mogul\u2019s supporters such influence. Berry has proposed a slate that includes two supporters apiece of John Kasich, Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz and one supporter of Marco Rubio. The eighth slot is left unfilled. Delegates now have less than 48 hours to vote for an alternative. Any delegate wishing to vote for an alternative candidate is required to go through the time-consuming process of voting for a full slate of new candidates. \u201cIf you are NOT voting for the slate, you MUST include the name for each of the positions listed,\u201d it says. While the Trump campaign has faced a multitude of challenges with delegate selection in states where that process is separate from the primary election, delegates are picked directly by the campaign in New Hampshire. This means that every delegate bound to Trump on the first ballot has been hand chosen by the real estate mogul\u2019s campaign. However, even without changing the composition of the delegates, membership of the convention committees still has a major impact on the result of the nomination. In particular, the rules committee, composed of one man and one woman, has free rein to rewrite the rules and change requirements for delegates being bound by primaries. In this case, a rules committee made up of party members hostile to Trump could, in theory, change the method by which delegates are bound to candidates and therefore reduce Trump\u2019s vote. It is likely to play a key rule in any attempt to prevent Trump from being the nominee in Cleveland. Jennifer Horn, the chair of the New Hampshire party who condemned Trump as \u201cun-American\u201d after his call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States in December, said the committee election process was \u201cnot something I am going to discuss with the press until it\u2019s totally closed\u201d. Horn is the state party\u2019s candidate for both delegation chair and to be a representative on the committee on permanent organisation. The RNC did not immediately respond for a request for comment.",

    "webTitle": "Coalition announces $1.2bn for schools but Labor says funding 'inadequate'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Coalition has announced $1.2bn in extra funding for education over three years from 2018, conditional on the states accepting testing and minimum standards. The funding is aimed at the last years of the so-called Gonski package \u2013 2018, 2019 and 2020 \u2013 but the funding offer is just a fraction of the $30bn cut (over 10 years) to education contained in Tony Abbott\u2019s 2014 budget. At the 2013 election, the Coalition promised to match the Gonski funding before backtracking. Labor has already promised $4.5bn in extra funding in 2018 and 2019 or $37.3bn over a decade. The education minister, Simon Birmingham, said the funding would be tied to \u201cneeds-based distribution of funding\u201d \u2013 a definition associated with the Gonski model but the conditional aspect of the funding deal differentiates it from Gonski. \u201cSchool funding will grow every year from current record levels of investment but at an affordable rate of growth based on recent changes in the cost of delivering education,\u201d Birmingham said. \u201cMost importantly, it will be tied to evidence-based initiatives that will lift student performance and results.\u201d The conditions for funding include standardised year 1 school assessment of students\u2019 reading, phonics and numeracy skills, annual reports to parents that identify literacy and numeracy attainment against national standards, and a minimum standard of literacy and numeracy skills for year 12 school leavers. The government also wants to link teacher salary progression to demonstrated competency and achievement against the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers, rather than just length of service. As prime minister, Abbott tied funding increases to inflation of 2.5%. The Turnbull government\u2019s plan is to index education funding to a rate of 3.6%. Under the Gonski model, average schools received a 3.6% increase annually, the most disadvantaged schools received a 4.7% increase to \u201ccatch up\u201d, while historically well resourced schools received 3%. Labor\u2019s Chris Bowen described the $1.2bn in education funding as \u201cpathetically inadequate\u201d. \u201cThis is the government which promised before the last election to match Labor dollar for dollar and cut $30bn out of education,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a prime minister who just a couple of weeks ago argued the federal government should withdraw entirely from funding public schools but continue funding private schools. \u201cNow we\u2019re supposed to believe before an election that they support public education. They are trying to say they will have checks and balances on the states. \u201cThis is the government who made a virtue of withdrawing all strings from federal funding with disastrous results and now it appears they\u2019re going to require teachers to do more testing and then not give them the resources they need to fix any problems which emerge in the testing.\u201d The treasurer, Scott Morrison, rejected claims that Labor was doing more on education, describing the Coalition plan as \u201creal money\u201d. \u201cThe previous government made all sorts of promises in health and education with money that wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThe second thing is the expenditure is targeted and targeted about getting results, back-to-basics results in education. Real outcomes for children in our schools. It is not just throwing cash at a problem, a big bag of cash at the states, which they can just spend as they wish and will.\u201d The Victorian education minister, James Merlino, said the federal government offer of $1.2bn over three years was \u201cnowhere near enough\u201d. \u201cPeople won\u2019t be fooled by this,\u201d Merlino said. \u201cThe difference between the federal government funding their obligation under the Gonski agreement and not in Victorian schools is $1.1bn. \u201cWhat they are proposing is $1.2bn across the whole of the country and over three years. Victorians are going to be hundreds of millions of dollars worse off and they are not going to be fooled.\u201d He acknowledged that while Australia had a good education system, there were still not enough students performing at the \u201chighest achievement levels\u201d. Merlino said there was a \u201cbig gap\u201d between children starting school and he agreed governments needed to focus on the early years. \u201cBut the federal government can\u2019t say \u2018let\u2019s test five-year-olds\u2019 and yet [walk] away from funding for kindergartens,\u201d Merlino said. \u201cWe need support in the kindergarten years so they are ready to start school. We hear a lot of ideology from the federal government but are they going to support 15 hours for four-year-olds in kindergarten for the long term?\u201d And Merlino rejected outright the idea that teachers should be paid according to the performance of children. He said there was no evidence anywhere in the world that showed performance pay made a difference in student outcomes. \u201cPerformance pay pitting teachers against each other just does not work - we are not in favour of that,\u201d Merlino said. The New South Wales education minister, Adrian Piccoli, who has been a strong advocate for the Gonski education model, said the federal government\u2019s proposed reforms were consistent with his state\u2019s reform but he called for the full Gonski funding agreed to by the former Labor government. \u201cWhilst the additional funding to be provided is a step in the right direction, NSW will continue to advocate for the full Gonski funding in its agreement with the commonwealth government,\u201d Piccoli said.",

Best slapstick Came from Cardiff at Hillsborough. Keeper David Marshall failed to see the ball out, tried and failed to foul his opponent, then ended up stranded. Team-mate Lee Peltier rounded it off by blootering the resulting cross into his own net from a yard. Least thought out Everton\u2019s proactive social media team displayed home fans\u2019 inspirational tweets on a big screen outside Goodison on Saturday \u2013 but failed to check them first. Cue inevitable \u201cMart\u00ednez Out\u201d frenzy. Theme of the day Everyone out. Blackpool\u2019s Oyston Out protest was fierce, Villa\u2019s Lerner Out weary, and Arsenal\u2019s Wenger Out split the crowd. Failed plan of the day Alan Pardew called in England rugby union head coach, Eddie Jones, to \u201cprevent complacency\u201d at Palace before the trip to Newcastle. Time for Plan C. Normal service resumed After a season of unfamiliar mid-table stability, League One Doncaster are on the move again. Their last five seasons: down, up, down, 13th, and heading down again. Sideline of the day Part-time Braintree Town, managed by FitzWimarc school\u2019s PE teacher Danny Cowley, are three wins from the Football League after sealing a play-off place. Most sobering thought West Brom\u2019s Jonathan Leko became the first Premier League starter born in 1999.",
